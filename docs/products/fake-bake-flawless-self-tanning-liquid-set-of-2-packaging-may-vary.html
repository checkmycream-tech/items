            <li>Does not smell like most do and goes on so even without streaking or looking orange.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Seriously, better than spray tans.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I read all of the reviews and tips when buying this</li>
            <li>, most were spot on.  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on great and spreads very evenly with the mitt.  </li>
            <li>but this is soooo much better.  </li>
            <li>Can say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li>I love using the mitt to apply.  </li>
            <li>Also, smells way better then</li>
            <li>ive ever used! :)</li>
            <li>I guess I should follow directions better for a cleaner application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent, color, and mit are all better then ST.  </li>
            <li>And I make sure to wash my mitt after every use.  </li>
            <li>The scent is ok...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it&#x27;s overwhelming</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:) The applicator is a dream.  </li>
            <li>my favorite place to use it is on my legs and on my chest.</li>
            <li>I have so many people hooked on this product</li>
            <li>just be sure that you don&#x27;t miss areas.</li>
            <li>Beautisol has much better mittens- also sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Even considering never tanning in the tanning bed again. :)</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li>but if you love tanning in the beds and are just trying to get away from tanning in the beds</li>
            <li>I am going to go get a tanning package today &amp; be reunited with my lost love of tanning in a bed</li>
            <li>mommys- make sure you apply after the babes are</li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>One of the better products out there.  </li>
            <li>I got a set of  2 for about $20 which was an outstanding deal.</li>
            <li>Many reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Be sure and lotion or baby oil elbows knees and feet.</li>
            <li>Amaze&#x27;s me buying more now so</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product, no streak marks</li>
            <li>The mitt allows you to buff in the spray which is so much better than a tanning lotion, gel or cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look orange in anyway, makes u ACTUALLY LOOK TAN, A GREAT tan at that!</li>

            <li>nice rich brown tan without tanning bed or sun</li>
            <li>I am way too old to be messing around with the dangers of tanning beds or sitting in the sun; to say nothing of the time it would take to try to get any color with my fair skin!  </li>

            <li>I have tried many self tanners, This stuff is GREAT, no muss no fuss, no waiting 1/2 hour or more to dry, no stained clothes, no SMELL.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Applying it is easy and you can see where you applied it</li>
            <li>I am not orange, it doesn&#x27;t smell, the application is SO easy, and it WORKS.</li>
            <li>and you have to be sure you are in an area easy to clean up or with towels</li>
            <li>It was Easy to apply, just follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>The soft mitten it comes with really makes the application flawless.</li>
            <li>and you can do it easily at any time during the day/night</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This tanner dries very quickly and does not rub off on sheets.  </li>
            <li>Came in a nice package and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But other wise its a fairly good product.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice self tanner.  </li>
            <li>id wash before applying makeup; the color is alittle dark on my face for my skintone but after a wash its perfect!!!</li>
            <li>The color was great and very natural looking but it faded quickly and areas like the inside of the elbows very quickly lost color in the heat.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, the best tanning prosecutor I&#x27;ve bought yet.</li>
            <li>would have been fine except I am allergic to something in the product</li>
            <li>so it looks very natural on a fair person with freckles like me.</li>
            <li>The color is great instantly...</li>
            <li>I can then wear light clothes without staining them.</li>
            <li>The color is great -- it is brown (with red in it)</li>
            <li>The tanning liquid itself is fantastic</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth with the mit.</li>
            <li>I followed all directions to the T. May as well buy the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>but it is also streak free.</li>
            <li>I shave with hair conditioner to make it a smooth process.  </li>
            <li>This one is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll run in streaks like a cheap water color.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable using all over because of streakiness, and I&#x27;ve used them in every price-range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not smell.</li>
            <li>A nice even natural looking tan and no nasty smell.  </li>
            <li>I like this because it smells good, unlike most self-tanners, and it is a very natural, pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I love that it shows up right away and</li>
            <li>It was so easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>People always compliment me on my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34; I love the color when I first apply the tanner, but it fades almost all the way off as soon as I shower.</li>
            <li>The first 2 applications kinda smeared but after you shower and repeat it gets better.</li>
            <li>Dries super quick!</li>
            <li>This is the first self tanning stuff I have just fallen in love with it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>The solution dries super quick so there is no rub off on clothing!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Best part is it has a beachy coconut smell when you first put it on, but as it develops the smell is very minimal.  </li>
            <li>This spray on liquid is actually the best so far.</li>
            <li>Love the color, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a more natural look from the sun.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked is if it lasted longer without having to re-apply and if it faded more evenly(but</li>
            <li>Apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li>I encourage you to give a try and enjoy looking good this summer without risking over exposure to the sun for the same effect.  </li>
            <li>I put mine on at night after a shower on clean skin.</li>
            <li>It is super easy and quick to apply, and there is no sticky residue to deal with.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because I have never had a sunless tanner look so amazing and natural!</li>
            <li>I wish the mitt had some kind of finger holds on the inside while leaving the full mitt effect on the outside to have better hold of the mitt while using.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s easy to  apply, I&#x27;ve never had any streaking, and it gives immediate color which deepens over a few hours.</li>
            <li>I go to a salon to get hand sprayed sometimes for special occasions but for touch ups and maintaince, I use this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and assumed I needed a lotion to get great results.</li>
            <li>works great and looks great but make sure you wear the gloves when you apply it because it does come through on the glove and stains your hands in a bad way but</li>
            <li>I decided to try a spray as a last resort to lotion, even the gradual tanners that ended up orange, because I thought I was stuck using moisturizing products in order to get a good even application.</li>
            <li>and this is definitely a much better color and much faster.  </li>
            <li>Tips, make sure that you exfoliate before you use the product you will have a much nicer experience.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>No bad aroma, no orange on the skin, no streaking,</li>
            <li>no bad anything.  </li>
            <li>No unpleasant odor, easy to apply and love the natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>The most natural looking and easily applied self-tanner</li>
            <li>works good but comes off easily when wet.</li>
            <li>but that is a good thing; if you mess up, it isn&#x27;t too dark to fix and now my tan is PERFECT...</li>
            <li>The soft applicator mitt makes it really easy to get it on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use - I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I really do want to love this product because everything is amazing about it, up until the point where I shower and am back to my light brown skin color.</li>
            <li>No sticky feeling and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>It will probably wash off quickly in a pool.  </li>
            <li>You look great the second you put this on and really can go out and do things with no worries...</li>
            <li>I love you so much, Fake Bake Flawless Self-Tanning Liquid.</li>
            <li>sometimes if you are super sweaty/working out.</li>
            <li>A quick list of pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>great product I will be back later to purchase more</li>
            <li>other than that the stuff is worth it and great</li>
            <li>It has a great smell going on, but I can smell a slight &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This one is easy on my skin and really is brown- no orange at all.</li>
            <li>Love the color....looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t come off on anything after your first shower though!</li>
            <li>The application is made so easy because of the fact that you see where it is going, just like applying make up to your face, only better.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, quick to dry, little to no scent, great color, and the color builds well if you apply it on consecutive days!</li>
            <li>It actually smells really nice, a tropical summer-y sun tan lotion scent.</li>
            <li>I love that you can spray directly onto the skin and blend in with the mitt or you can spray onto the mitt and then rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The tanner will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of work that goes into prepping the skin for application, but it&#x27;s worth it for even color.  </li>
            <li>The color seemed more natural and I don&#x27;t feel like  orange freak.</li>
            <li>and worth every penny.would like the price dropped since i order every two  weeks.</li>
            <li>I feel the smell is worth it to me though to look tan.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural not orange &amp; the more layers you put on the darker you get.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite tanning products.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural and healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, even had spray tan professionally done, and i still prefer this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on day 3 and color still looks fresh and wears evenly.</li>
            <li>then by morning, I look like I&#x27;m fresh from the beach!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>It gives me very bronzed golden skin, not streaky or orange at all!  </li>
            <li>It applied evenly and flawlessly right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Yeah right.</li>
            <li>It washes right off when you shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it really is streak free, it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>: first day of application it does come off onto clothes (if you sweat or get wet) until you take shower than it is good.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation very helpful to clean the skin and prep for tan application</li>
            <li>I waited to shower until the next morning and although some color washed off I was still left with this great golden glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman with dark hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know if it is my fault or a bad batch, because everyone seems to be having a perfect time with this self tanner.</li>
            <li>I love Fake Bake, I have been using it for months and am so happy with the level of gradual tan that it gives me.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and look natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks natural if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am really sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li>The color is nice, but requires a few layers on my so-clear-you-can-see-my-bones light skin.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, dries as quick as you put it on.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the product works great and lasts at least a month</li>
            <li>I have been using self tanners for years and have tried many different kinds.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams and lotions, but this actually works really well!  </li>
            <li>My skin is as white as the driven snow and this product gives me a healthy tan and smells of coconut sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I tried Fake Bake Flawless for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>This is the first time a self tanner worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying one of the Moroccan spa gloves and using that to exfoliate prior to application, that seemed to make it more even looking.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure that even with a spray tan you would see the same effect.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s tinted so you can see exactly where the color is going.  </li>
            <li>First thing in the morning after my shower, I applied the product.  </li>
            <li>Only lasts a couple days, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>; solution if a higher quality mitt was provided.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>But, it just didn&#x27;t do exactly what I had imagined it would.</li>
            <li>I put it on 3 times the first day, every 4 hours with a shower in between.  </li>
            <li>This product produces wonderful results,  No more countless hours laying in the sun or going to a tanning salon,  no harmful effects of uv rays too!</li>
            <li>It dries almost instantly, so I am not having to worry about rubbing it off on my clothes, sheets, husband, etc :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshipper, so when my twin sister got skin cancer, I was told to stay out of the sun because of the higher risk for me to get it.</li>
            <li>The mitt helps make the application very even!</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>This is some of the best fake tanner ever.</li>
            <li>my whole life, this is quite exciting).  </li>
            <li>Quite a bit comes off in the first shower after applying, so</li>
            <li>The residual tan doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate on a regular basis though.  </li>
            <li>No weird smell.</li>
            <li>After using more products than I could possibly take time to name for YEARS, I came across this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was exfoliating before first use then after 5 days</li>
            <li>FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li>FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY sunless tanning lotions/sprays/systems over the last 15 years and NOTHING compares to this!</li>
            <li>I am sure there is some sort of red die in the mix.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;- Read the directions and follow them</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t panic when you shower after the first coat.</li>
            <li>Good tanner but extremely messy</li>
            <li>I do have to cut down the tube on the spritzer nozzle for it to fit better.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this product, but had to switch to lotions due to the massive clean up.</li>
            <li>I am ghostly white, and this stuff gives me a nice, natural color.</li>
            <li>The application of the product was easy enough, and the color pay off at first</li>
            <li>I used to use the lotion many years ago, then switched to St. Tropez mousse because it dried faster and looked more natural after you just put it on.</li>
            <li>The bottle also lasts a long time; I am getting many applications out of it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every self-tanner out there</li>
            <li>Very realistic.</li>
            <li>Another product I used previously which I liked called Perfection use to come off your skin from humidity and salt water at the beach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used before, and easy to get an all-over tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re applying a true sun produced golden glow that you see instantly!  </li>
            <li>so you shower off in the morning, the only problem is the color is not near as good, but it will avoid streaks all over if you get splashed by water.</li>
            <li>However, it washed out of my white sheets just fine.</li>
            <li>But you get a pretty decent supply so it can be re-applied as often as needed.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned and have tried drug store and high-end self tanning products.</li>
            <li>packaged well, fast delivery and works as described.</li>
            <li>it looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>And you really don&#x27;t miss any spots when you use the mitt - it goes on brown.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an answer to sun worshipers prayer as you can get the color you want without the fear of sun damage.</li>
            <li>I just expected to be more brown.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I did exfoliate before I put it on and do think it worked much</li>
            <li>The one that I don&#x27;t really like is the smell that accompanies sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>really thats its job</li>
            <li>I am going straight to Facebook and recommending it to all my friends.  </li>
            <li>This tanner really makes you look slimmer and it hides stretch marks, freckles, scars, etc.</li>
            <li>Much safer and quicker than going tanning</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it doesnt peel off or isn&#x27;t patchy really although I had a problem with even color on my legs,i found that if you apply the color by spraying onto your gloves then patting on your legs</li>
            <li>Thank&#x27;s so much...</li>
            <li>, it really does tan you up</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My bottle doesn&#x27;t leak at all thanks to that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product at first, it does give you a dark tan</li>
            <li>However, no matter how long I let this product sit on my skin, or how many days in a row I reapplied, the color seemed to completely wash off in the shower!</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on me tan than any other.</li>
            <li>but you have to apply it 4 days in a row to achieve a deep rich tan that mimics what you get from a bed..</li>
            <li>Be sure to put an oil or other lotion over your knuckles, knees, elbows and ankles.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who wants to look tanned without the harmful effects of the sun or tanning beds.</li>
            <li>It is very fast drying and so far, hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on my sheets at night.  </li>
            <li>I have super white skin and strawberry hair just to give you an idea of how much I needed this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Watch out for those dry spots like your ankles and elbows, goes over knees just fine.</li>
            <li>No orange glow, natural looking, no streaks and dries fast!</li>
            <li>which i&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t be for 6 months due to the amount i was sent for just $30!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products, but I will not be looking for anything else anymore!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this product again, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a pretty, sun-free tan!</li>
            <li>As a recovering tanorexic, I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>After it washes off, you still have a decent tan.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to deeply exfoliate prior to applying this.  </li>
            <li>the product came quickly and the price is so low.</li>
            <li>For the palest of pales (like myself), we will have to do this twice a week to keep a steady tan through the summer.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely zero orange color and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Many people said the spray bottle was a mess, so I did not use it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The color indicator makes evert new application obvious, but the tan looks better after following the process for about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>By far the BEST fake tan!</li>
            <li>While it is usually pretty dry to the touch on my body when I finish, but I still wear some long sleeve/long pant pajamas just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t color the sheets, etc.</li>
            <li>The mitt also seems to break down pretty quickly and look dingy however it is still very usable despite it looking worn.</li>
            <li>it does make it a little bit more even</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is not dry when applying this product, it will pool in the dry lines and appear darker in those area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to apply and works extremely well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very long lasting however, and does seem to wash off easily.</li>
            <li>Thank you FAKE BAKE and, more importantly, thank you to all the consumers that write the reviews that guide the rest of us to products that really work.</li>
            <li>What I have been doing which really helps is, after I use it and shower the next day, everyday after for my moisturizer, I use Jergens natural glow gradual tanner and this keeps my tan looking perfect everyday.</li>
            <li>I  am pretty fair, and self tanners always turned me the fake orange color.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is ,you really need to keep using it because a lot of the brown washes off the first time you bathe.</li>
            <li>OK but messy.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; smell after it has dried but it looks great.</li>
            <li>I have used probably around 6 different self tanners in the past 3 or 4 years, and I really wanted to love this one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and right for the price-</li>
            <li>It does last right at a week.</li>
            <li>The color is great, the application is a little messy.  </li>
            <li>Finding it at Amazon for half price made stocking up here an easy decision.</li>
            <li>so I knew how to apply it properly, and it really works very well.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan, no orange at all.</li>
            <li>goes on with no strikes( use lotion on palms, elbows, knees and feet), and has a very natural color.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for temporary color for a special event (that does not include getting your skin wet)</li>
            <li>It looks natural and lays evenly on your skin, no faking here!</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>I just ordered another one so that I have a back up when I finish the first bottle, which I think will not be for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product and it seems to last a while longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>Your pores are open after the shower and heat wait an hour or two after because my first time the product got I to my pores</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last week</li>
            <li>the scent is not so weird like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Compared to most self tanners, the initial color pay off of this product is amazing, and the black cherry smell is hard to beat!</li>
            <li>I find that once my skin is dry they brush right off though.</li>
            <li>It was great for one evening; unfortunately, it all washed off in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much color washed off (the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), but a truly-believable tan remains.</li>
            <li>Great scent initially, and no gnarly fake tan scent afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like my sunless tan to look natural and you can&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li>No harsh smells.  </li>
            <li>The color is that of a natural tan acquired outdoors.</li>
            <li>I have all ready recommended it to several friends!</li>
            <li>Just stumbled upon this product on you tube one night, the woman was doing make up on mature women</li>
            <li>so you can get it even, and it leaves a natural tan look.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old graddaughter even used it when she was marshall for graduation.</li>
            <li>It even fades naturally.</li>
            <li>It does seem to wash off almost completely though.</li>
            <li>There is a smell that carries on your skin with this unless the lotion completely disappears from your skin with accumulated shower/baths.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; until they naturally caught up from wearing shorts/bathing suit.</li>
            <li>This product not only lasts for a reasonable amount of time (about three days)</li>
            <li>Color looks so natural everyone thought I went to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Its a natural looking color that fades well (unless you scrub in one spot then it may appear blotchy).</li>
            <li>It comes with a professional mitt, and the liquid.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The whole idea is to block the product seeping through the palms and apply only on the skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle will last forever too, since you don&#x27;t have to use much of it each time you apply.</li>
            <li>It is the best,by far.</li>
            <li>The people I work with couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how tan I was and how natural it looked.  </li>
            <li>I got this because i had recently hada baby &amp; didn&#x27;t have time to tan really  </li>
            <li>have a 1yr old son who loves to pull himself up on my legs and of course needs to be carried sometimes.</li>
            <li>Color looked natural.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s washed out of everything.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I do not like that If you get near water or you sweat you will see the spots .</li>
            <li>Gives a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>fake is what it is doesn&#x27;t even look good</li>
            <li>Fake Bake has Made my day i am tanned so good</li>
            <li>also make sure not to put this on any dry skin areas because it will show up DARK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that holding the sprayer right up to my skin and give a few pumps then quickly blending before it runs down too far is much neater than spraying the mitt.</li>
            <li>You can pay more for other tanners but none are better than Fake Bake.</li>
            <li>particular version (there are several) comes with a soft mitt and latex gloves to protect your hands from any cast-off color.</li>
            <li>I put it on every other night after a bath and wake up golden.</li>
            <li>This product does ggive a natural dark tan;however; it is messy to apply and you do need to bathe after it dries to get the access off, the mitt is a nice addition in smoothing out the affect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair, not super pale but do take a little while to get tan.</li>
            <li>I am super pale.</li>
            <li>This product does tend to come off pretty heavy on my clothing and is VERY sensitize to water for the first few hours</li>
            <li>It fades VERY unevenly and blotchy, it doesn&#x27;t make you very dark at all, it almost dries too quickly which can result in a splotchy application, the tropical smell fades quickly to leave you with the DHA smell.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not pale when wearing short sleeves or capris.  </li>
            <li>The potion dries quickly and you can dress soon after applying, but I usually wear something loose while getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li>The color is natural looking, and the application process is simple.</li>
            <li>but the next day it looked so natural.</li>
            <li>it looked natural after washing the next day.</li>
            <li>or my ethnicities (I&#x27;m a washed-out caramel color naturally, am Native, Cuban, and Greek.)</li>
            <li>then again even a natural tan seems to fade quicker on legs than upper body).</li>
            <li>It dries almost instantly, and the color is a beautifully natural tan that you&#x27;d get from the beach.</li>
            <li>I am in love and addicted to this.</li>
            <li>Thank you Fake Bake for finally producing a product that actually works for us glow-in-the-dark fair skinned folk.</li>
            <li>but it washes right out even if you get a little on something.  </li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t usually stand the smell of most of the other options out there.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that actually looks natural!</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t comment on any use other than for legs.</li>
            <li>I felt the color faded fast and needed to be applied every other day to maintain.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a little messy on the top</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried when I first put it in because it looked orange</li>
            <li>Works really well,  does seen to take a long time to thoroughly dry</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s smooth texture and very hard too apply liquid wearing the latex glove and the mitt.  </li>
            <li>Great color, easiest to apply and impossible to get a negative result and dries fast</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I continue to use and love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> I have tried many ,many , many , self tanners ,</li>
            <li> There could be a better &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Does not smell like most do and goes on so even without streaking or looking orange.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seriously, better than spray tans.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I read all of the reviews and tips when buying this</li>
            <li> , most were spot on.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes on great and spreads very evenly with the mitt.  </li>
            <li> but this is soooo much better.  </li>
            <li> Can say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li> I love using the mitt to apply.  </li>
            <li> Also, smells way better then</li>
            <li> ive ever used! :)</li>
            <li> I guess I should follow directions better for a cleaner application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent, color, and mit are all better then ST.  </li>
            <li> And I make sure to wash my mitt after every use.  </li>
            <li> The scent is ok...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it&#x27;s overwhelming</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :) The applicator is a dream.  </li>
            <li> my favorite place to use it is on my legs and on my chest.</li>
            <li> I have so many people hooked on this product</li>
            <li> just be sure that you don&#x27;t miss areas.</li>
            <li> Beautisol has much better mittens- also sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Even considering never tanning in the tanning bed again. :)</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> but if you love tanning in the beds and are just trying to get away from tanning in the beds</li>
            <li> I am going to go get a tanning package today &amp; be reunited with my lost love of tanning in a bed</li>
            <li> mommys- make sure you apply after the babes are</li>
            <li> Pleased</li>
            <li> One of the better products out there.  </li>
            <li> I got a set of  2 for about $20 which was an outstanding deal.</li>
            <li> Many reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Be sure and lotion or baby oil elbows knees and feet.</li>
            <li> Amaze&#x27;s me buying more now so</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product, no streak marks</li>
            <li> The mitt allows you to buff in the spray which is so much better than a tanning lotion, gel or cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look orange in anyway, makes u ACTUALLY LOOK TAN, A GREAT tan at that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered MANY times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, great scent, easy application!</li>
            <li> nice rich brown tan without tanning bed or sun</li>
            <li> I am way too old to be messing around with the dangers of tanning beds or sitting in the sun; to say nothing of the time it would take to try to get any color with my fair skin!  </li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully, smells divine, stays on for DAYS, doesn&#x27;t look orange, and is thee most natural looking tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sun Goddess, which came highly recommended, and although it gave great color, I always ended up with an inconsistent application.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tan skin look.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead and an AVID user of sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> love this product does not streak gives a great natural tan color</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, love it</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a wonderful product !!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, so to avoid too much sun, I&#x27;ve tried most self tanning products out there.</li>
            <li> Looks great too, very natural.</li>
            <li> Still worth every penny, love it!</li>
            <li> Like many others reviewing this product, I am extremely fair skinned and have never been happy with the orange color I turn using typical sunless products.  </li>
            <li> lol enjoy your new product!</li>
            <li> I am a VERY fair skinned redhead and burn if I&#x27;m outside longer than 5 mins, so I decided to try this</li>
            <li> Was really not too impressed with this self tanner.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> If you apply in circular motions with the mit the color will blend beautifully and you will no doubt be satisfied with your deep glow!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a great product The color is natural looking no orange</li>
            <li> Great product, price, shipping and complete transaction.  </li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, goes on even, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other night and it maintains a great tan!</li>
            <li> This produced a beautiful golden looking color, very natural looking!</li>
            <li> Actually smells good too!</li>
            <li> gorgeous color, smells nice, not streaky, lasts a long time :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, smells tropical cons:</li>
            <li> Application is made so easy, the mitt ensures even coverage</li>
            <li> I hope this will not come off that easily like that one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on for a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on, easy to see while applyibg</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, goes on with out streaking and gives you an instant golden glow</li>
            <li> Not orangey at all, and is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners, This stuff is GREAT, no muss no fuss, no waiting 1/2 hour or more to dry, no stained clothes, no SMELL.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Applying it is easy and you can see where you applied it</li>
            <li> I am not orange, it doesn&#x27;t smell, the application is SO easy, and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> and you have to be sure you are in an area easy to clean up or with towels</li>
            <li> It was Easy to apply, just follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> The soft mitten it comes with really makes the application flawless.</li>
            <li> and you can do it easily at any time during the day/night</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This tanner dries very quickly and does not rub off on sheets.  </li>
            <li> Came in a nice package and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> But other wise its a fairly good product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice self tanner.  </li>
            <li> id wash before applying makeup; the color is alittle dark on my face for my skintone but after a wash its perfect!!!</li>
            <li> The color was great and very natural looking but it faded quickly and areas like the inside of the elbows very quickly lost color in the heat.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, the best tanning prosecutor I&#x27;ve bought yet.</li>
            <li> would have been fine except I am allergic to something in the product</li>
            <li> so it looks very natural on a fair person with freckles like me.</li>
            <li> The color is great instantly...</li>
            <li> I can then wear light clothes without staining them.</li>
            <li> The color is great -- it is brown (with red in it)</li>
            <li> The tanning liquid itself is fantastic</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth with the mit.</li>
            <li> I followed all directions to the T. May as well buy the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> but it is also streak free.</li>
            <li> I shave with hair conditioner to make it a smooth process.  </li>
            <li> This one is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll run in streaks like a cheap water color.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable using all over because of streakiness, and I&#x27;ve used them in every price-range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and does not smell.</li>
            <li> A nice even natural looking tan and no nasty smell.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it smells good, unlike most self-tanners, and it is a very natural, pretty color.  </li>
            <li> I love that it shows up right away and</li>
            <li> It was so easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> People always compliment me on my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34; I love the color when I first apply the tanner, but it fades almost all the way off as soon as I shower.</li>
            <li> The first 2 applications kinda smeared but after you shower and repeat it gets better.</li>
            <li> Dries super quick!</li>
            <li> This is the first self tanning stuff I have just fallen in love with it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> The solution dries super quick so there is no rub off on clothing!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best part is it has a beachy coconut smell when you first put it on, but as it develops the smell is very minimal.  </li>
            <li> This spray on liquid is actually the best so far.</li>
            <li> Love the color, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a more natural look from the sun.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked is if it lasted longer without having to re-apply and if it faded more evenly(but</li>
            <li> Apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li> I encourage you to give a try and enjoy looking good this summer without risking over exposure to the sun for the same effect.  </li>
            <li> I put mine on at night after a shower on clean skin.</li>
            <li> It is super easy and quick to apply, and there is no sticky residue to deal with.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because I have never had a sunless tanner look so amazing and natural!</li>
            <li> I wish the mitt had some kind of finger holds on the inside while leaving the full mitt effect on the outside to have better hold of the mitt while using.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s easy to  apply, I&#x27;ve never had any streaking, and it gives immediate color which deepens over a few hours.</li>
            <li> I go to a salon to get hand sprayed sometimes for special occasions but for touch ups and maintaince, I use this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and assumed I needed a lotion to get great results.</li>
            <li> works great and looks great but make sure you wear the gloves when you apply it because it does come through on the glove and stains your hands in a bad way but</li>
            <li> I decided to try a spray as a last resort to lotion, even the gradual tanners that ended up orange, because I thought I was stuck using moisturizing products in order to get a good even application.</li>
            <li> and this is definitely a much better color and much faster.  </li>
            <li> Tips, make sure that you exfoliate before you use the product you will have a much nicer experience.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> No bad aroma, no orange on the skin, no streaking,</li>
            <li> no bad anything.  </li>
            <li> No unpleasant odor, easy to apply and love the natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> The most natural looking and easily applied self-tanner</li>
            <li> works good but comes off easily when wet.</li>
            <li> but that is a good thing; if you mess up, it isn&#x27;t too dark to fix and now my tan is PERFECT...</li>
            <li> The soft applicator mitt makes it really easy to get it on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use - I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I really do want to love this product because everything is amazing about it, up until the point where I shower and am back to my light brown skin color.</li>
            <li> No sticky feeling and drys quickly.</li>
            <li> It will probably wash off quickly in a pool.  </li>
            <li> You look great the second you put this on and really can go out and do things with no worries...</li>
            <li> I love you so much, Fake Bake Flawless Self-Tanning Liquid.</li>
            <li> sometimes if you are super sweaty/working out.</li>
            <li> A quick list of pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> great product I will be back later to purchase more</li>
            <li> other than that the stuff is worth it and great</li>
            <li> It has a great smell going on, but I can smell a slight &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This one is easy on my skin and really is brown- no orange at all.</li>
            <li> Love the color....looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t come off on anything after your first shower though!</li>
            <li> The application is made so easy because of the fact that you see where it is going, just like applying make up to your face, only better.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, quick to dry, little to no scent, great color, and the color builds well if you apply it on consecutive days!</li>
            <li> It actually smells really nice, a tropical summer-y sun tan lotion scent.</li>
            <li> I love that you can spray directly onto the skin and blend in with the mitt or you can spray onto the mitt and then rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The tanner will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of work that goes into prepping the skin for application, but it&#x27;s worth it for even color.  </li>
            <li> The color seemed more natural and I don&#x27;t feel like  orange freak.</li>
            <li> and worth every penny.would like the price dropped since i order every two  weeks.</li>
            <li> I feel the smell is worth it to me though to look tan.  </li>
            <li> Looks natural not orange &amp; the more layers you put on the darker you get.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite tanning products.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural and healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, even had spray tan professionally done, and i still prefer this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on day 3 and color still looks fresh and wears evenly.</li>
            <li> then by morning, I look like I&#x27;m fresh from the beach!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> It gives me very bronzed golden skin, not streaky or orange at all!  </li>
            <li> It applied evenly and flawlessly right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Yeah right.</li>
            <li> It washes right off when you shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, it really is streak free, it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> : first day of application it does come off onto clothes (if you sweat or get wet) until you take shower than it is good.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation very helpful to clean the skin and prep for tan application</li>
            <li> I waited to shower until the next morning and although some color washed off I was still left with this great golden glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman with dark hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to know if it is my fault or a bad batch, because everyone seems to be having a perfect time with this self tanner.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake, I have been using it for months and am so happy with the level of gradual tan that it gives me.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and look natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks natural if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am really sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but requires a few layers on my so-clear-you-can-see-my-bones light skin.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, dries as quick as you put it on.</li>
            <li> The price is right, the product works great and lasts at least a month</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners for years and have tried many different kinds.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams and lotions, but this actually works really well!  </li>
            <li> My skin is as white as the driven snow and this product gives me a healthy tan and smells of coconut sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I tried Fake Bake Flawless for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> This is the first time a self tanner worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying one of the Moroccan spa gloves and using that to exfoliate prior to application, that seemed to make it more even looking.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sure that even with a spray tan you would see the same effect.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s tinted so you can see exactly where the color is going.  </li>
            <li> First thing in the morning after my shower, I applied the product.  </li>
            <li> Only lasts a couple days, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> ; solution if a higher quality mitt was provided.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> But, it just didn&#x27;t do exactly what I had imagined it would.</li>
            <li> I put it on 3 times the first day, every 4 hours with a shower in between.  </li>
            <li> This product produces wonderful results,  No more countless hours laying in the sun or going to a tanning salon,  no harmful effects of uv rays too!</li>
            <li> It dries almost instantly, so I am not having to worry about rubbing it off on my clothes, sheets, husband, etc :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshipper, so when my twin sister got skin cancer, I was told to stay out of the sun because of the higher risk for me to get it.</li>
            <li> The mitt helps make the application very even!</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best fake tanner ever.</li>
            <li> my whole life, this is quite exciting).  </li>
            <li> Quite a bit comes off in the first shower after applying, so</li>
            <li> The residual tan doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate on a regular basis though.  </li>
            <li> No weird smell.</li>
            <li> After using more products than I could possibly take time to name for YEARS, I came across this stuff.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was exfoliating before first use then after 5 days</li>
            <li> FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li> FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY sunless tanning lotions/sprays/systems over the last 15 years and NOTHING compares to this!</li>
            <li> I am sure there is some sort of red die in the mix.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;- Read the directions and follow them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t panic when you shower after the first coat.</li>
            <li> Good tanner but extremely messy</li>
            <li> I do have to cut down the tube on the spritzer nozzle for it to fit better.  </li>
            <li> I really loved this product, but had to switch to lotions due to the massive clean up.</li>
            <li> I am ghostly white, and this stuff gives me a nice, natural color.</li>
            <li> The application of the product was easy enough, and the color pay off at first</li>
            <li> I used to use the lotion many years ago, then switched to St. Tropez mousse because it dried faster and looked more natural after you just put it on.</li>
            <li> The bottle also lasts a long time; I am getting many applications out of it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every self-tanner out there</li>
            <li> Very realistic.</li>
            <li> Another product I used previously which I liked called Perfection use to come off your skin from humidity and salt water at the beach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used before, and easy to get an all-over tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re applying a true sun produced golden glow that you see instantly!  </li>
            <li> so you shower off in the morning, the only problem is the color is not near as good, but it will avoid streaks all over if you get splashed by water.</li>
            <li> However, it washed out of my white sheets just fine.</li>
            <li> But you get a pretty decent supply so it can be re-applied as often as needed.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and have tried drug store and high-end self tanning products.</li>
            <li> packaged well, fast delivery and works as described.</li>
            <li> it looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> And you really don&#x27;t miss any spots when you use the mitt - it goes on brown.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an answer to sun worshipers prayer as you can get the color you want without the fear of sun damage.</li>
            <li> I just expected to be more brown.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I did exfoliate before I put it on and do think it worked much</li>
            <li> The one that I don&#x27;t really like is the smell that accompanies sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> really thats its job</li>
            <li> I am going straight to Facebook and recommending it to all my friends.  </li>
            <li> This tanner really makes you look slimmer and it hides stretch marks, freckles, scars, etc.</li>
            <li> Much safer and quicker than going tanning</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it doesnt peel off or isn&#x27;t patchy really although I had a problem with even color on my legs,i found that if you apply the color by spraying onto your gloves then patting on your legs</li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s so much...</li>
            <li> , it really does tan you up</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My bottle doesn&#x27;t leak at all thanks to that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product at first, it does give you a dark tan</li>
            <li> However, no matter how long I let this product sit on my skin, or how many days in a row I reapplied, the color seemed to completely wash off in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments on me tan than any other.</li>
            <li> but you have to apply it 4 days in a row to achieve a deep rich tan that mimics what you get from a bed..</li>
            <li> Be sure to put an oil or other lotion over your knuckles, knees, elbows and ankles.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone who wants to look tanned without the harmful effects of the sun or tanning beds.</li>
            <li> It is very fast drying and so far, hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on my sheets at night.  </li>
            <li> I have super white skin and strawberry hair just to give you an idea of how much I needed this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Watch out for those dry spots like your ankles and elbows, goes over knees just fine.</li>
            <li> No orange glow, natural looking, no streaks and dries fast!</li>
            <li> which i&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t be for 6 months due to the amount i was sent for just $30!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products, but I will not be looking for anything else anymore!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a pretty, sun-free tan!</li>
            <li> As a recovering tanorexic, I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> After it washes off, you still have a decent tan.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to deeply exfoliate prior to applying this.  </li>
            <li> the product came quickly and the price is so low.</li>
            <li> For the palest of pales (like myself), we will have to do this twice a week to keep a steady tan through the summer.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely zero orange color and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Many people said the spray bottle was a mess, so I did not use it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The color indicator makes evert new application obvious, but the tan looks better after following the process for about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> By far the BEST fake tan!</li>
            <li> While it is usually pretty dry to the touch on my body when I finish, but I still wear some long sleeve/long pant pajamas just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t color the sheets, etc.</li>
            <li> The mitt also seems to break down pretty quickly and look dingy however it is still very usable despite it looking worn.</li>
            <li> it does make it a little bit more even</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is not dry when applying this product, it will pool in the dry lines and appear darker in those area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to apply and works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very long lasting however, and does seem to wash off easily.</li>
            <li> Thank you FAKE BAKE and, more importantly, thank you to all the consumers that write the reviews that guide the rest of us to products that really work.</li>
            <li> What I have been doing which really helps is, after I use it and shower the next day, everyday after for my moisturizer, I use Jergens natural glow gradual tanner and this keeps my tan looking perfect everyday.</li>
            <li> I  am pretty fair, and self tanners always turned me the fake orange color.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is ,you really need to keep using it because a lot of the brown washes off the first time you bathe.</li>
            <li> OK but messy.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; smell after it has dried but it looks great.</li>
            <li> I have used probably around 6 different self tanners in the past 3 or 4 years, and I really wanted to love this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and right for the price-</li>
            <li> It does last right at a week.</li>
            <li> The color is great, the application is a little messy.  </li>
            <li> Finding it at Amazon for half price made stocking up here an easy decision.</li>
            <li> so I knew how to apply it properly, and it really works very well.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan, no orange at all.</li>
            <li> goes on with no strikes( use lotion on palms, elbows, knees and feet), and has a very natural color.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re looking for temporary color for a special event (that does not include getting your skin wet)</li>
            <li> It looks natural and lays evenly on your skin, no faking here!</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another one so that I have a back up when I finish the first bottle, which I think will not be for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this product and it seems to last a while longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> Your pores are open after the shower and heat wait an hour or two after because my first time the product got I to my pores</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last week</li>
            <li> the scent is not so weird like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Compared to most self tanners, the initial color pay off of this product is amazing, and the black cherry smell is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> I find that once my skin is dry they brush right off though.</li>
            <li> It was great for one evening; unfortunately, it all washed off in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much color washed off (the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), but a truly-believable tan remains.</li>
            <li> Great scent initially, and no gnarly fake tan scent afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like my sunless tan to look natural and you can&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> No harsh smells.  </li>
            <li> The color is that of a natural tan acquired outdoors.</li>
            <li> I have all ready recommended it to several friends!</li>
            <li> Just stumbled upon this product on you tube one night, the woman was doing make up on mature women</li>
            <li> so you can get it even, and it leaves a natural tan look.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old graddaughter even used it when she was marshall for graduation.</li>
            <li> It even fades naturally.</li>
            <li> It does seem to wash off almost completely though.</li>
            <li> There is a smell that carries on your skin with this unless the lotion completely disappears from your skin with accumulated shower/baths.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; until they naturally caught up from wearing shorts/bathing suit.</li>
            <li> This product not only lasts for a reasonable amount of time (about three days)</li>
            <li> Color looks so natural everyone thought I went to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Its a natural looking color that fades well (unless you scrub in one spot then it may appear blotchy).</li>
            <li> It comes with a professional mitt, and the liquid.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The whole idea is to block the product seeping through the palms and apply only on the skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last forever too, since you don&#x27;t have to use much of it each time you apply.</li>
            <li> It is the best,by far.</li>
            <li> The people I work with couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how tan I was and how natural it looked.  </li>
            <li> I got this because i had recently hada baby &amp; didn&#x27;t have time to tan really  </li>
            <li> have a 1yr old son who loves to pull himself up on my legs and of course needs to be carried sometimes.</li>
            <li> Color looked natural.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s washed out of everything.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I do not like that If you get near water or you sweat you will see the spots .</li>
            <li> Gives a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> fake is what it is doesn&#x27;t even look good</li>
            <li> Fake Bake has Made my day i am tanned so good</li>
            <li> also make sure not to put this on any dry skin areas because it will show up DARK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that holding the sprayer right up to my skin and give a few pumps then quickly blending before it runs down too far is much neater than spraying the mitt.</li>
            <li> You can pay more for other tanners but none are better than Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> particular version (there are several) comes with a soft mitt and latex gloves to protect your hands from any cast-off color.</li>
            <li> I put it on every other night after a bath and wake up golden.</li>
            <li> This product does ggive a natural dark tan;however; it is messy to apply and you do need to bathe after it dries to get the access off, the mitt is a nice addition in smoothing out the affect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair, not super pale but do take a little while to get tan.</li>
            <li> I am super pale.</li>
            <li> This product does tend to come off pretty heavy on my clothing and is VERY sensitize to water for the first few hours</li>
            <li> It fades VERY unevenly and blotchy, it doesn&#x27;t make you very dark at all, it almost dries too quickly which can result in a splotchy application, the tropical smell fades quickly to leave you with the DHA smell.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not pale when wearing short sleeves or capris.  </li>
            <li> The potion dries quickly and you can dress soon after applying, but I usually wear something loose while getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li> The color is natural looking, and the application process is simple.</li>
            <li> but the next day it looked so natural.</li>
            <li> it looked natural after washing the next day.</li>
            <li> or my ethnicities (I&#x27;m a washed-out caramel color naturally, am Native, Cuban, and Greek.)</li>
            <li> then again even a natural tan seems to fade quicker on legs than upper body).</li>
            <li> It dries almost instantly, and the color is a beautifully natural tan that you&#x27;d get from the beach.</li>
            <li> I am in love and addicted to this.</li>
            <li> Thank you Fake Bake for finally producing a product that actually works for us glow-in-the-dark fair skinned folk.</li>
            <li> but it washes right out even if you get a little on something.  </li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t usually stand the smell of most of the other options out there.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that actually looks natural!</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t comment on any use other than for legs.</li>
            <li> I felt the color faded fast and needed to be applied every other day to maintain.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little messy on the top</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I first put it in because it looked orange</li>
            <li> Works really well,  does seen to take a long time to thoroughly dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s smooth texture and very hard too apply liquid wearing the latex glove and the mitt.  </li>
            <li> Great color, easiest to apply and impossible to get a negative result and dries fast</li>
            <li> I repeat this process, and after a few consecutive days, enough color will deposit on my skin, and I will have a decent looking tan, and I won&#x27;t have to apply it that day.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and other self tanners made my legs itch.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a week to keep myself looking healthy instead of my usual pasty, pasty white.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful of overspray so do not do this on carpet or near anything textile.</li>
            <li> Will transfer to clothes and half of it washes down the drain with the first shower.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel I had to exfoliate that much, just the usual shave.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my suggestion: when you take off the screw cap, just poke a small hole in the protectant seal, rather than removing the whole seal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> You could definitely spray and then go out as long as you dont mind the coconut scent...</li>
            <li> It comes with a flat screw cap, and then a spritzing cap.</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews, this is like every other tanning product and does not go on evenly without major, major effort and it discolors after a day or two.</li>
            <li> This product even covers the uneven spots of my skin to give a solid tan look instead of the natural blotches of discoloration on my skin.</li>
            <li> : With a mitt it was hard to do certain areas of the body ( belly button and feet).</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about color washing off in the morning following an evening application, I chose a different strategy.  </li>
            <li> Have bought other self-tanning products that were terrible but this was great!</li>
            <li> I wasted so much time on other products.</li>
            <li> As per another review cutting the tube of the spray top makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it ruins white bras and underwear by turnig them a reddish color.  </li>
            <li> I wear it year round, and people are always saying things about me being naturally olive skinned.</li>
            <li> The mitt that comes with the tanning liquid is definitely not professional.  </li>
            <li> The color is natural - more of a slightly red base.</li>
            <li> If you find you&#x27;ve missed a spot, it&#x27;s easy to correct, and if you&#x27;ve gone too crazy or colored \\&quot;outside</li>
            <li> it washes off in the shower, it does not build a tan, no matter how long you leave it to dry after applying it, it still washes off.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and a little washes off in the shower so apply extra.</li>
            <li> The other products I used smelled, not when applying, but later when I began to sweat or when the skin does whatever it does.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to the fact that I work out every day and take multiple showers.</li>
            <li> Love fake bake !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love and committed to Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> you spray the tanner on the mitt and then apply on your skin and therefore the bottle lasts alot longer then the other brands because your using only the amount you need instead of getting excess spray everywhere which also eliminates self tanner on the bottoms of your feet!</li>
            <li> Another thing to note is that I love how, if I was in a bit of hurry applying my fake bake, I can just go get it out and fix a spot I may have missed!  </li>
            <li> I had discovered this stuff a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with this product and it never stinks like feet!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, goes on easily, the only bad thing I have found is the mitt tends to leave little fuzzies n you after application.</li>
            <li> The lotion does dry immediately on your skin</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin,</li>
            <li> I have (combination-oily on t zone, fairly dry on arms and legs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale and do not tan well, and I&#x27;m constantly getting asked if I just got back from the beach!</li>
            <li> and every single time I try to get some sun...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
            <li> You can get an instant bronze that gets slightly darker as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to apply incorrectly and is indeed golden and natural with NO orange at all.</li>
            <li> She ordered after trying several products that were less than expected.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with my pale skin, especially in the winter, but FAKE BAKEgave me beautiful color and wasn&#x27;t messy or &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; !!</li>
            <li> Love this product and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> They are not kidding when they say it does not really have the Self-tanner smell.  </li>
            <li> I have tired a lot of sunless tanners before and all of them have either faded really fast or turned our streaky.</li>
            <li> And I have had to go out in the rain soon after application a time or two and absolutely no streaking or fading.  </li>
            <li> Some fading occurs upon bathing, which is to be expected, of course.  </li>
            <li> Just like any self tanner, it darkens these rough areas most.&lt;br</li>
            <li> FINALLY something that works, doesn&#x27;t smell awful, doesn&#x27;t leave me streaky, and doesn&#x27;t involve skim damage on my fair, refuses-to-tan complexion.</li>
            <li> and I just personally prefer to tan in a tanning salon...if you are cool with painting on your tan instead of going to the beds because you feel it is soo bad for you</li>
            <li> and she said she loves it and will never use any other tanning lotion again.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if my daughter uses it on any other part of her body</li>
            <li> The odor is nothing compared to other tanners I have tried though.</li>
            <li> so be careful!  </li>
            <li> No funny smell, you can see where you&#x27;re putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I first tried Fake Bake a couple of weeks ago on the advice of a salesperson at Ulta.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolutely worst, does not do what it says it is supposed to do, It does give a nice color!  </li>
            <li> but other than that</li>
            <li> I too was a bit skeptical when I purchased this the first time, expecting the same old orange, streaky, fake, stinky skin results of every other product out there.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I may have over exaggerated a little with the title, but im serious guys....</li>
            <li> When you are really white it can be hard not to look orange, but this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent weird color on legs and feet.</li>
            <li> Then, I wear dark clothes so it doesn&#x27;t stain them, and then I bathe before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> This stuff will give you a dark color as soon as you put it on, but beware of using it in the bathroom shower to spray - it will get everywhere.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it would stay on longer.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake guide system, which helps you to see the application so you don&#x27;t have streaks is a system that makes the product appear darker than it really is.</li>
            <li> and you think your fake tan is darker than it really is; the guide system darker color washes off in the shower or if you applied moisturizer on the skin before showering.  </li>
            <li> I would say my tan lasts 3 days on average.</li>
            <li> It does not make a mess in the bathroom like other spray tanners bc</li>
            <li> only negative is the glove.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or give off a quirky scent; however, later on I did notice a faint odor, but nothing like with tanning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and usually only before I shower off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The liquid itself is dark in color, so</li>
            <li> When you shower you will notice some color in the water as it goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> So, I typically apply the product after I shower.</li>
            <li> Stays on 3-4 days, a day or so less if you&#x27;re in water or sweat a lot.  </li>
            <li> You need to wash the mitt after every application because after the stuff builds up it will give you an odd orangey color.  </li>
            <li> It fades in 3 days or less, and I feel like I am continuously having to reapply.</li>
            <li> Hours after applying it however the smell turns into a typical tanning product scent.</li>
            <li> and I had little black dots from it getting into my hair follicle pores</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and it fades gracefully without leaving those annoying patchy areas.</li>
            <li> Which by the way, despite other reviews, I can say there was very little color transfer to my clothes or bed sheets.  </li>
            <li> i look a little orange</li>
            <li> a little orange after 2 applications...</li>
            <li> the lines\\&quot; you can  wipe off your mistakes with a washcloth and a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> , I just need a little practice blending it in cause</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this sunless tanner was the uneven fading...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts for a couple of days so no need to apply everyday and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;run&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> almost year round</li>
            <li> What a waste of 25 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I do however have a few things I dislike the after smell like all self tanners</li>
            <li> If I could give a half star, this would be a 4 1/2!</li>
            <li> Hhmmm....different, a bit messy, not easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I am so pale</li>
            <li> I can not be pale</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, did my research and was still a little skeptical because the aroma of other self tanning products was still clinging to my nose as I looked at the orange results of other tanning products on my body.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell as you get with most self tanners.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I used Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub and my Exfoliant and plan to try Fake Bake&#x27;s in the future.  </li>
            <li> With small hands I find I have to pinch the mitt with my fingers to keep it on my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale legs</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t mess it up!!</li>
            <li> It sounds annoying and tricky, but the color is so pretty I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> And, almost as importantly as the application, IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL AWFUL.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative</li>
            <li> this is a spray and it is brown, read some people said it got all over - duh</li>
            <li> Lots of people complained that the bottle leaked.</li>
            <li> I mean, I may have over</li>
            <li> I will never try any other fake tanner.</li>
            <li> Stop wasting time and money on other products and get yourself some Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the other products in the Fake Bake line, including the one for the face and the body polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to health conditions i&#x27;m unable to lay in a tanning bed...</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I personally like going to tanning salons even though I know it is bad for you</li>
            <li> I have never successfully tanned until I found this product.</li>
            <li> (well maybe, I at least am one of the palest!)</li>
            <li> I got tired of waiting on product and purchased another product else</li>
            <li> I am shocked how often I get compliments on my tan from using this (being a pale girl</li>
            <li> You will see color go down the drain, but a base layer does stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It also smells faintly of coconut.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with this all summer.</li>
            <li> I never have streaks or blotches, even when I apply it carelessly.</li>
            <li> Faint odor but washes off with shower and doesn&#x27;t stick around like others.</li>
            <li> so I used Fake Bake this summer to &amp;#34;catch my legs</li>
            <li> however, when she is unable to tan me, I don&#x27;t mind using this stuff at all.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use without the mitten or you will be verrry sorry.</li>
            <li> Did not turn me orange or any weird unnatural color.</li>
            <li> but it still looked like i had something wrong with my skin on my legs</li>
            <li> because then you are truly tan with the fake bake I felt like I was painting on my skin</li>
            <li> the smell is weird</li>
            <li> but after about 1hr you start to smell that weird off smell so about hour 3</li>
            <li> This is a fake tanning product.</li>
            <li> I am awful at applying and even I couldn&#x27;t mess this one up, not one streak.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong!</li>
            <li> Fake bake works wonders!</li>
            <li> They are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s fake and that I do it myself!  </li>
            <li> Once the color faded it was impossible to get it to look even again</li>
            <li> Tons of ladies have asked me if I had been tanning and were shocked when they found out</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will never ever buy FAKE and BAKE products again!  </li>
            <li> Amazon has REALLY disappointed me this time!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ll never tan again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to apply and works extremely well.  Very realistic.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners for years and have tried many different kinds. I prefer literal sublime bronze over this one. Pros: It dries very quickly, smells tropical cons: It fades VERY unevenly and blotchy, it doesn&#x27;t make you very dark at all, it almost dries too quickly which can result in a splotchy application, the tropical smell fades quickly to leave you with the DHA smell. My biggest problem with this sunless tanner was the uneven fading... I like my sunless tan to look natural and you can&#x27;t do that if you&#x27;re all splotchy!</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake, I have been using it for months and am so happy with the level of gradual tan that it gives me.  I have tried so many creams and lotions, but this actually works really well!  So well that I even bought one for my mom to use when we went to the beach!  It looks natural and lays evenly on your skin, no faking here!</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent weird color on legs and feet. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Arms look  okay . And I am following directions to a T</li>
            <li> My skin is as white as the driven snow and this product gives me a healthy tan and smells of coconut sunscreen.  Doesn&#x27;t look orange nor streaky.  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and have tried drug store and high-end self tanning products. I tried Fake Bake Flawless for the first time tonight and I am IN LOVE. It was so easy and quick to apply. I have tried Sun Goddess, which came highly recommended, and although it gave great color, I always ended up with an inconsistent application. I have very dry skin and assumed I needed a lotion to get great results. I decided to try a spray as a last resort to lotion, even the gradual tanners that ended up orange, because I thought I was stuck using moisturizing products in order to get a good even application. I am SO GLAD I found this. It applied evenly and flawlessly right out of the bottle. I am seriously impressed by it. And, almost as importantly as the application, IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL AWFUL. It actually smells really nice, a tropical summer-y sun tan lotion scent. Even products that claim to have a pleasant scent always end up making me smell like burnt plastic. The color is great instantly... I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in the morning. FINALLY something that works, doesn&#x27;t smell awful, doesn&#x27;t leave me streaky, and doesn&#x27;t involve skim damage on my fair, refuses-to-tan complexion. Do yourself a favor... Stay out of the tanning bed and get this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time a self tanner worked for me.  I  am pretty fair, and self tanners always turned me the fake orange color.  Follow the directions and you too can look like you have a great tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now.  I use it every other night and it maintains a great tan! I have received so many compliments about what a nice tan I have. They are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s fake and that I do it myself!  No streaks and not orange at all!  I love that you can spray directly onto the skin and blend in with the mitt or you can spray onto the mitt and then rub into the skin.  The color comes out instantly so you know that there are no streaks.  I go to a salon to get hand sprayed sometimes for special occasions but for touch ups and maintaince, I use this product.  It also smells faintly of coconut. No harsh smells.  I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman with dark hair and I do not tan but burn when out in the sun. This product makes me look like I tan naturally with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, looks good. Smell doesn&#x27;t matter- every tanner has a smell, and this one didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s simple to use and right for the price- will be buying again.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this. She ordered after trying several products that were less than expected. This product works great and the tan color looks very real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> works great and does not stink! love the mitt for application. If you apply it at night,it does rub off on the sheets a bit sometimes. However, it washed out of my white sheets just fine.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, goes on easily, the only bad thing I have found is the mitt tends to leave little fuzzies n you after application. I find that once my skin is dry they brush right off though.</li>
            <li> Love, love. love this item.  It is so easy to use and look natural.</li>
            <li> I am super pale. My boyfriend sings &amp;#34;whiter shade of pale&amp;#34; when I wear shorts. I have never successfully tanned until I found this product. It looked amazing. Not orange. Literally everything else on earth turned my skin bright orange. I was obsessed with this all summer. I would recommend buying one of the Moroccan spa gloves and using that to exfoliate prior to application, that seemed to make it more even looking. Also, very lightly apply lotion to your knees and ankles before using, I had some issues there. All in all, I will never use anything else to tan.</li>
            <li> This is my go to sunless tanner. The color is natural looking, and the application process is simple. Spray on, wipe in. I never have streaks or blotches, even when I apply it carelessly. People always compliment me on my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34; I love the color when I first apply the tanner, but it fades almost all the way off as soon as I shower. So, I typically apply the product after I shower. Then, I wear dark clothes so it doesn&#x27;t stain them, and then I bathe before I go to sleep. I repeat this process, and after a few consecutive days, enough color will deposit on my skin, and I will have a decent looking tan, and I won&#x27;t have to apply it that day.  I can then wear light clothes without staining them. It sounds annoying and tricky, but the color is so pretty I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is a great price and gives you a great glow. I suggest showering, applying, then washing your face in morning for the best tan look. The mitt is perfect and protects your hands as well!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use and looks natural if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Good tanner but extremely messy</li>
            <li> Love it. The first 2 applications kinda smeared but after you shower and repeat it gets better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! packaged well, fast delivery and works as described. I just used it for the first time last night. As of now i kind of feel like in florescent light i look a little orange but i&#x27;m sure that even with a spray tan you would see the same effect. My boyfriend says it looks GREAT, so i&#x27;ll take his word for it! I will be buying more when i run out. which i&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t be for 6 months due to the amount i was sent for just $30! A great price for the amount you receive. compared to spending $25 a week for a pro spray tan. Doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell as you get with most self tanners. No sticky feeling and drys quickly. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you look like an umpa lumpa!!! lol enjoy your new product!</li>
            <li> The color is great, the application is a little messy.  As per another review cutting the tube of the spray top makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> This product even covers the uneven spots of my skin to give a solid tan look instead of the natural blotches of discoloration on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff will give you a dark color as soon as you put it on, but beware of using it in the bathroom shower to spray - it will get everywhere. The mist will collect on the shower head, air vents, shower hook/pole. I really loved this product, but had to switch to lotions due to the massive clean up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunless tanner. I used to use the lotion many years ago, then switched to St. Tropez mousse because it dried faster and looked more natural after you just put it on. This spray on liquid is actually the best so far. The color is great -- it is brown (with red in it) so it looks very natural on a fair person with freckles like me. When you are really white it can be hard not to look orange, but this stuff does the trick. I wear it year round, and people are always saying things about me being naturally olive skinned. Yeah right. My only complaint is that I wish it would stay on longer. A good amount of it comes off after showering.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! You will not be orange and no streaks! I&#x27;ll never use another product! Why get spray tans when you can do them yourself at home?!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have used.  No smell whatsoever, during application or after.  The other products I used smelled, not when applying, but later when I began to sweat or when the skin does whatever it does.  The Fake Bake guide system, which helps you to see the application so you don&#x27;t have streaks is a system that makes the product appear darker than it really is. The lotion does dry immediately on your skin and you think your fake tan is darker than it really is; the guide system darker color washes off in the shower or if you applied moisturizer on the skin before showering.  But it is not a problem.  After it washes off, you still have a decent tan.  If I want to be darker, I just apply again the next day or for several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 latex gloves to wear and a Application Mitt to put over one of your gloved hands. It is a spray bottle and you spray the tanning lotion onto the glove and spread it onto your skin. It is SO easy to apply and you look great immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my daughter a bottle and she said she loves it and will never use any other tanning lotion again.  I agree with her!  The bottle also lasts a long time; I am getting many applications out of it.  I just ordered another one so that I have a back up when I finish the first bottle, which I think will not be for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this on my legs.  I do not know if my daughter uses it on any other part of her body so I really can&#x27;t comment on any use other than for legs.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping. Love this product and it seems to last a while longer than other brands. Make sure to wash hands thoroughly after use.</li>
            <li> When you shower it washes off.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the Wife she loves it and uses it all the time, although I do think its a bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I heard a bunch of good reviews. So I watched a lot of demos on how to use the product and it worked amazing it looks like a real tan. I was a little worried when I first put it in because it looked orange but the next day it looked so natural. Word of advice I put this on after a shower and exploiting like the demos said do not do that. Your pores are open after the shower and heat wait an hour or two after because my first time the product got I to my pores and I had little black dots from it getting into my hair follicle pores so do it awhile after the shower.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have tried so many self tanners over the years, including the expensive tanning salons and also the pricey self applications. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet!  I have very fair skin and tend to get an orange tinge even with the best of them.  I also can&#x27;t usually stand the smell of most of the other options out there.  This produced a beautiful golden looking color, very natural looking! The smell is like a suntan lotion, coconut, and doesn&#x27;t turn to a funky smell later.  Application is made so easy, the mitt ensures even coverage and it&#x27;s tinted so you can see exactly where the color is going.  This was the best I&#x27;ve found for around the ankles, tops of feet and wrists and hands.  Dries super quick! After reading other reviews about color washing off in the morning following an evening application, I chose a different strategy.  First thing in the morning after my shower, I applied the product.  I chose clothes that didn&#x27;t matter if color got on them. Which by the way, despite other reviews, I can say there was very little color transfer to my clothes or bed sheets.  I waited to shower until the next morning and although some color washed off I was still left with this great golden glow.  My new favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Only lasts a couple days, but that&#x27;s ok.  I have a history of Melanoma, so tanning beds are out.  I was always terrified to try self tanning lotions because at 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; I would look like the biggest damn oompa lumpa ever, but I decided to give it a go after reading these reviews. It looks good, cured my winter blues, and I continue cancer free.  So happy I found this!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and other self tanners made my legs itch. This one is easy on my skin and really is brown- no orange at all. And you really don&#x27;t miss any spots when you use the mitt - it goes on brown. The only thing is ,you really need to keep using it because a lot of the brown washes off the first time you bathe. It says to use it at night , but I prefer the morning - and it hasn&#x27;t come off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned.  This works nice and is easy to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t last long.  Basically you shower it off each day,.  Gives a nice color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB! gorgeous color, smells nice, not streaky, lasts a long time :)&lt;br /&gt;This will always be my go to!</li>
            <li> I continue to use and love this product. Make sure that you wash your glove after each application and you will have the beautiful, flawless glow! I&#x27;m extremely pale and do not tan well, and I&#x27;m constantly getting asked if I just got back from the beach! This doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and it fades gracefully without leaving those annoying patchy areas.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner for years!  You can pay more for other tanners but none are better than Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Liked the product. Put it on arms and legs it looked natural after washing the next day. Sprayed on glove but not mitt to apply. Hoping this makes product last longer.  Last 6 or 7 days.  It will probably wash off quickly in a pool.  I will see what it does when I go to the beach. Another product I used previously which I liked called Perfection use to come off your skin from humidity and salt water at the beach.  I can not find that product in my town anymore. I hope this will not come off that easily like that one. If you have solid sheets lay on a beach towel in bed because some will get on your sheets.  However, it will wash out when you wash clothes.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because I have never had a sunless tanner look so amazing and natural! Watch out for those dry spots like your ankles and elbows, goes over knees just fine. Perfect coloring!</li>
            <li> I like this because it smells good, unlike most self-tanners, and it is a very natural, pretty color.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on for a week. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The color is that of a natural tan acquired outdoors. Goes on very easily and you can see almost immediately the results. Make sure your skin is not dry when applying this product, it will pool in the dry lines and appear darker in those area&#x27;s. There is absolutely zero orange color and looks very natural. It&#x27;s not very long lasting however, and does seem to wash off easily. But you get a pretty decent supply so it can be re-applied as often as needed. It&#x27;s really an answer to sun worshipers prayer as you can get the color you want without the fear of sun damage. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great self tanner! Easy to use, no streaks and smells wonderful! I have all ready recommended it to several friends!</li>
            <li> I have tried many ,many , many , self tanners , THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST ONE EVER !  Just stumbled upon this product on you tube one night, the woman was doing make up on mature women and she used a bit of this for a bronzer on the face, PERFECT !! Thanks so much for a wonderful product !!</li>
            <li> Love the color....looks very natural.  Stays on 3-4 days, a day or so less if you&#x27;re in water or sweat a lot.  The mitt that comes with the tanning liquid is definitely not professional.  It doesn&#x27;t maintain it&#x27;s smooth texture and very hard too apply liquid wearing the latex glove and the mitt.  There could be a better &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; solution if a higher quality mitt was provided.  The tanning liquid itself is fantastic</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I have tried. Does not smell like most do and goes on so even without streaking or looking orange. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love it! I am a VERY fair skinned redhead and burn if I&#x27;m outside longer than 5 mins, so I decided to try this so I would be darker than my wedding dress.&lt;br /&gt;It works great! It&#x27;s easy to put on, easy to see while applyibg so you can get it even, and it leaves a natural tan look. No worries about looking orange.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a couple of days so no need to apply everyday and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; when you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to look tanned without the harmful effects of the sun or tanning beds.</li>
            <li> Was really not too impressed with this self tanner. I used it multiple times and never achieved a glowing tan like everybody that has used it says. I am quite unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Very natural looking tan, no orange at all. Easy to apply, nice smell, and great results.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is very easy to apply.  All you have to do is spray it on the included mitt and rub it in.  It has some color so it&#x27;s easy to get nice blended color without streaks.  The color itself is a nice brown, not orange like some products.  No odor and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My 13 year old graddaughter even used it when she was marshall for graduation. It goes on so smooth with the mit.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m pretty fair, not super pale but do take a little while to get tan. This color is perfect on me and product is super easy and quick to apply. RAVED about this to all my friends who ended up going and purchasing this. I get compliments all the time! Would buy again and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got tired of waiting on product and purchased another product else where. Amazon has REALLY disappointed me this time!</li>
            <li> This is the first self tanning stuff I have just fallen in love with it smells great works wonderfully and no organey color and I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li> The most natural looking and easily applied self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Seriously, better than spray tans. No orange, a very nice brown. No streaks either when you follow their simple instructions.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, so to avoid too much sun, I&#x27;ve tried most self tanning products out there. This is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s easy to  apply, I&#x27;ve never had any streaking, and it gives immediate color which deepens over a few hours. I love it! Would recommend it to any/everyone.</li>
            <li> Okay so I may have over exaggerated a little with the title, but im serious guys.... I am so pale but I have a red under tone.. I call it pig skin :/ anyways im a little orange after 2 applications... I mean, I may have over did it so it may be my fault. But, it just didn&#x27;t do exactly what I had imagined it would. :( I will probably still use it once a week, because like I said the orange color isn&#x27;t unbearable. I just expected to be more brown. But other wise its a fairly good product.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is the second self tanner I&#x27;ve I tried and it&#x27;s a winner. It doesn&#x27;t streak and goes on easily. It even fades naturally.</li>
            <li> It was perfect!!! Easy to apply. No streaking. Awesome color blend. Fast shipping &amp; reasonable price. Have bought other self-tanning products that were terrible but this was great!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I read all of the reviews and tips when buying this and I have to say, most were spot on.  This stuff goes on great and spreads very evenly with the mitt.  I wish there were a tool to spread on my back, which is one reason i gave it 4 starts, not 5.  I have super white skin and strawberry hair just to give you an idea of how much I needed this stuff.  Here are some tips...&lt;br /&gt;1.  Many people said the spray bottle was a mess, so I did not use it.  I poured it right from the bottle on the mitt and it worked perfectly so skip the spray...&lt;br /&gt;2.  I put it on 3 times the first day, every 4 hours with a shower in between.  This does take a few times to get really tan but that is a good thing; if you mess up, it isn&#x27;t too dark to fix and now my tan is PERFECT...&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use Xen Tan balm, it works great at smoothing out elbows, knees and feet&lt;br /&gt;4.  I did exfoliate before I put it on and do think it worked much better.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I wish the bronzer did not get washed off.  You look great the second you put this on and really can go out and do things with no worries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray tan a lot and use Loreal sublime lotion but this is soooo much better.  They are not kidding when they say it does not really have the Self-tanner smell.  I am really sensitive to strong smells and that is the only reason I did not tan as often as I should.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of tanners and this one does not rub off on my clothes and takes forever to fad and no yucky scale skin when it fades.....u wont find a better product!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great.  A nice even natural looking tan and no nasty smell.  The soft applicator mitt makes it really easy to get it on smoothly and easily.  You need to wash the mitt after every application because after the stuff builds up it will give you an odd orangey color.  Fades evenly, no streaking.  Great product</li>
            <li> This product produces wonderful results,  No more countless hours laying in the sun or going to a tanning salon,  no harmful effects of uv rays too!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong! I have used probably around 6 different self tanners in the past 3 or 4 years, and I really wanted to love this one! I did all the necessary pre-tanning steps; shaving, exfoliating, moisturizing etc. The application of the product was easy enough, and the color pay off at first was absolutely gorgeous! Compared to most self tanners, the initial color pay off of this product is amazing, and the black cherry smell is hard to beat! However, no matter how long I let this product sit on my skin, or how many days in a row I reapplied, the color seemed to completely wash off in the shower! I&#x27;d love to know if it is my fault or a bad batch, because everyone seems to be having a perfect time with this self tanner. I really do want to love this product because everything is amazing about it, up until the point where I shower and am back to my light brown skin color. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the type of skin I have (combination-oily on t zone, fairly dry on arms and legs) or my ethnicities (I&#x27;m a washed-out caramel color naturally, am Native, Cuban, and Greek.) If anyone has had this problem, or has a solution please let me know!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you orange. Washes out of clothes  and sheets. Faint odor but washes off with shower and doesn&#x27;t stick around like others. I am awful at applying and even I couldn&#x27;t mess this one up, not one streak. This is the best stuff out there people.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is for its staying power. It fades in 3 days or less, and I feel like I am continuously having to reapply. This may be due to the fact that I work out every day and take multiple showers. I also end up swimming several times a week with my kids during the summer months. I don&#x27;t know if any tanner can hold up to all that. That being said, this is the best self tanner I have tried by far. The color is beautiful. It is super easy and quick to apply, and there is no sticky residue to deal with. It dries almost instantly, so I am not having to worry about rubbing it off on my clothes, sheets, husband, etc :). It has a great smell going on, but I can smell a slight &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; odor the next day after I shower off the guide color. The odor is nothing compared to other tanners I have tried though. It fades out beautifully, with no streaking at all. I will definitely buy this product again, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a pretty, sun-free tan!</li>
            <li> Greatest product ever.</li>
            <li> This is the only tanner I will use! I&#x27;ve tried several brands. This goes on great &amp; gives a great color. Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Hhmmm....different, a bit messy, not easy to travel with.  I prefer the Banana Boat self-tanner (see my review) and some time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much! Can say enough good things about it!! Smells wonderful, goes on with out streaking and gives you an instant golden glow</li>
            <li> Smells good, lasts long and has a wonderful color.  I got if for a really great price and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on  and it doesn&#x27;t make you orange and it has a great smile:) I will recommend it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshipper, so when my twin sister got skin cancer, I was told to stay out of the sun because of the higher risk for me to get it. I am not happy with my pale skin, especially in the winter, but FAKE BAKEgave me beautiful color and wasn&#x27;t messy or &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; !! Yay!!</li>
            <li> By far the BEST fake tan! This is the only one that actually looks natural! I have tried so many other products, but I will not be looking for anything else anymore! I will stick to this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a ton of compliments on the color of my skin after using this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use - I followed the directions exactly. Used coconut oil on elbows, knees, and feet before use. No streaks!</li>
            <li> Always the best self tanner for smell...It does seem to wash off almost completely though. I hope they have&#x27;nt changed the formula</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this self tanner!  It gives me very bronzed golden skin, not streaky or orange at all!  I love using the mitt to apply.  It is very fast drying and so far, hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on my sheets at night.  I recommend storing your bottles in the fridge ladies.  The tanner will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but requires a few layers on my so-clear-you-can-see-my-bones light skin.  There&#x27;s a lot of work that goes into prepping the skin for application, but it&#x27;s worth it for even color.  It was great for one evening; unfortunately, it all washed off in the shower the next morning.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for temporary color for a special event (that does not include getting your skin wet) it&#x27;s an awesome alternative to laying out or tanning beds.</li>
            <li> This product went above and beyond my expectations! It dosent leave you orange but rather with a great sun kissed tan.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very good color and easy to use!  The mitt helps make the application very even! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect application every time. Couldn&#x27;t be easier. Looks great too, very natural.</li>
            <li> Looks great and stays on well!  Just like getting a versa spray tan at the salon but at a fraction of the $! Also, smells way better then any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever had! :0)</li>
            <li> BEST self tanner ive ever used! :)</li>
            <li> It washes right off when you shower.I followed all directions to the T. May as well buy the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner that I have ever used.  I am ghostly white, and this stuff gives me a nice, natural color. Not orangey at all, and is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews that I read on Amazon. I guess I should follow directions better for a cleaner application. That&#x27;s on me. I will say what I definitely like about this. The color! The color seemed more natural and I don&#x27;t feel like  orange freak. I have very pale legs and I used it last year the night before going to Raging Waters. I don&#x27;t think it looked obvious that I was using a sunless tanner on my legs. The one that I don&#x27;t really like is the smell that accompanies sunless tanners. This is no exception. There is a smell that carries on your skin with this unless the lotion completely disappears from your skin with accumulated shower/baths.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, great scent, easy application! Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lasting time. Oh and amazon had the best price!</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners, This stuff is GREAT, no muss no fuss, no waiting 1/2 hour or more to dry, no stained clothes, no SMELL.  Awesome !</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews, this is like every other tanning product and does not go on evenly without major, major effort and it discolors after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> great product I will be back later to purchase more</li>
            <li> it is everything it says.I cant go a day without it.no orange...no streaks.beautiful color! and worth every penny.would like the price dropped since i order every two  weeks.</li>
            <li> Awesome way to gain some color without damaging your skin! I read tons of reviews so I knew how to apply it properly, and it really works very well. And it smells awesome! I wear tank tops almost year round so I used Fake Bake this summer to &amp;#34;catch my legs up&amp;#34; until they naturally caught up from wearing shorts/bathing suit. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love fake bake !nice rich brown tan without tanning bed or sun you really can&#x27;t beat it! No steaks like drugstore brands nice even application</li>
            <li> I have tired a lot of sunless tanners before and all of them have either faded really fast or turned our streaky. This product not only lasts for a reasonable amount of time (about three days) but it is also streak free. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tan skin look.</li>
            <li> works great and looks great but make sure you wear the gloves when you apply it because it does come through on the glove and stains your hands in a bad way but really thats its job lol</li>
            <li> The color was great and very natural looking but it faded quickly and areas like the inside of the elbows very quickly lost color in the heat.  I would recommend this product but only for people in cooler climates.  Once the color faded it was impossible to get it to look even again and I have since stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best fake tanner ever.</li>
            <li> Love my Fake Bake. I will never lay in a tanning bed again. So easy to use and you can&#x27;t mess it up!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and has made me a convert from San Tropez!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent, color, and mit are all better then ST.  I like the lactic glove as it prevents any of the liquid from getting onto your palms.  Color looks so natural everyone thought I went to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a great value for the 2 pack.</li>
            <li> fake is what it is doesn&#x27;t even look good would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have now used this for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  It doesn&#x27;t smell. Applying it is easy and you can see where you applied it so you know if you missed any spots. Its a natural looking color that fades well (unless you scrub in one spot then it may appear blotchy). It comes with the mitt. It&#x27;s budget friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I found the best time to apply it was at night and put lose pajamas on, sleep, wake up and rinse off. You must rinse off!! When you shower you will notice some color in the water as it goes down the drain. That helps from it rubbing off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: With a mitt it was hard to do certain areas of the body ( belly button and feet). I felt the color faded fast and needed to be applied every other day to maintain.</li>
            <li> I am shocked how often I get compliments on my tan from using this (being a pale girl my whole life, this is quite exciting).  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, goes on even, and dries quickly.  I make sure to deeply exfoliate prior to applying this.  I do have to cut down the tube on the spritzer nozzle for it to fit better.  And I make sure to wash my mitt after every use.  This product does tend to come off pretty heavy on my clothing and is VERY sensitize to water for the first few hours so be careful!  The scent is ok... what do you expect from a sunless tanner?  I don&#x27;t find it&#x27;s overwhelming but I do notice it throughout the day every now and then.  I feel the smell is worth it to me though to look tan.  Quite a bit comes off in the first shower after applying, so I feel I reapply often in the summer - hence why I bought the set of 2 this time.  I would say my tan lasts 3 days on average.</li>
            <li> I love you so much, Fake Bake Flawless Self-Tanning Liquid. No... Seriously. I am the palest female on the planet (well maybe, I at least am one of the palest!) and every single time I try to get some sun... I turn into a lobster. No matter what. If I use sunscreen, I stay the same color. THIS PRODUCT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE I JUST GOT BACK FROM A VACATION IN CANCUN. I am not orange, it doesn&#x27;t smell, the application is SO easy, and it WORKS. I will never try any other fake tanner. I&#x27;m in love and committed to Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> Great product if you want to avoid the sun or those tanning beds. Looks natural not orange &amp; the more layers you put on the darker you get. Have gotton compliments. Goes on easy, love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I&#x27;m trying to avoid tanning beds. It was a great purchase. At ulta one box costs 25$, so getting two for 25$ was a great deal. It comes with a professional mitt, and the liquid. The tanning liquid has a tropical scent to it, like coconuts. Hours after applying it however the smell turns into a typical tanning product scent. Still worth every penny, love it!</li>
            <li> Fades too quickly;also comes off when you sweat. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> OK but messy.  Will transfer to clothes and half of it washes down the drain with the first shower.  The residual tan doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.  Have gone back to Loreal towelettes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self-tanning spray that I have ever tried!  You can get an instant bronze that gets slightly darker as the day goes on.  You look tan, not orange and smells GREAT!  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanned, best on the market . This is the 4th or 5th time I&#x27;ve bought this .</li>
            <li> My wife uses this.  She loves it if she is happy I am happy</li>
            <li> would have been fine except I am allergic to something in the product so I ended up with nice tan hives!</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is a pretty nice self tanner.  The bottle is a little messy on the top and you have to be sure you are in an area easy to clean up or with towels spread out because it can spray all over.  The color is great and quick.  I probably apply it around twice a week throughout the summer and kept a nice color.  Be sure to exfoliate on a regular basis though.  I was using a lot of the gradual glow or gradual self tanner through jergens, sauve, etc and this is definitely a much better color and much faster.  No weird smell.</li>
            <li> I am in love and addicted to this. I tell everyone to buy it. I love that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner!!!!!! Smells great like coconuts or a day at the beach. The package along with the mitt includes latex gloves which is great so that no mixture gets on your hands. The solution dries super quick so there is no rub off on clothing! You could definitely spray and then go out as long as you dont mind the coconut scent... However if you put it on your face id wash before applying makeup; the color is alittle dark on my face for my skintone but after a wash its perfect!!! It does not make a mess in the bathroom like other spray tanners bc you spray the tanner on the mitt and then apply on your skin and therefore the bottle lasts alot longer then the other brands because your using only the amount you need instead of getting excess spray everywhere which also eliminates self tanner on the bottoms of your feet! Definitely reccomend to everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> Gives a great tan that is not orange. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead and an AVID user of sunless tanning products. After using more products than I could possibly take time to name for YEARS, I came across this stuff. I used it for the first time last week and I absolutely LOVE it! Goes on beautifully, smells divine, stays on for DAYS, doesn&#x27;t look orange, and is thee most natural looking tanner I have ever used. I wasted so much time on other products. There is nothing negative I could possibly come up with about it. Do yourself a favor. Stop wasting time and money on other products and get yourself some Fake Bake. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love the color, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a more natural look from the sun.  It was Easy to apply, just follow the directions.  I used Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub and my Exfoliant and plan to try Fake Bake&#x27;s in the future.  Tips, make sure that you exfoliate before you use the product you will have a much nicer experience.  I would also add shave before you exfoliate, that will help with the bumps.  I shave with hair conditioner to make it a smooth process.  :) The applicator is a dream.  I am going straight to Facebook and recommending it to all my friends.  A set of 2 for $24 bucks!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this self-tanning liquid! The soft mitten it comes with really makes the application flawless. I do prefer the customer airbrush tan ( I promise I am not a snob, my mom has a machine from working for a tanning salon ) however, when she is unable to tan me, I don&#x27;t mind using this stuff at all. It literally looks like I just got back from laying out in Hawaii. DO NOT use without the mitten or you will be verrry sorry. This is a great buy ! Wonderful formula and doesn&#x27;t stink ! my favorite place to use it is on my legs and on my chest. This tanner really makes you look slimmer and it hides stretch marks, freckles, scars, etc.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite tanning products. The price is right, the product works great and lasts at least a month and I&#x27;m a daily user. Came in a nice package and very fast delivery. I have so many people hooked on this product I will definitely be buying it again! No orange glow, natural looking, no streaks and dries fast! I recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Goes on with no streaking and color looks amazing!  Best part is it has a beachy coconut smell when you first put it on, but as it develops the smell is very minimal.  It also lasts for about 7 days with no blotchiness!  Worth the money! 😃</li>
            <li> Great for a safe sun kissed color. I&#x27;m so fair and it looks natural and healthy&lt;br /&gt;Works great under or over St.topez foam . I use them together with gloves and the was hands.</li>
            <li> Based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation I tried this. It works very well, dries as quick as you put it on. Non-greasy and does not have any overpowering smell to it that would make you not want to use it. I never had it rub off on clothing. It did very good with adding a bronzed coloring to darken my skin, even safe for my face. Did not turn me orange or any weird unnatural color. Much safer and quicker than going tanning and you can do it easily at any time during the day/night just be sure that you don&#x27;t miss areas. The only thing I would have liked is if it lasted longer without having to re-apply and if it faded more evenly(but then again even a natural tan seems to fade quicker on legs than upper body). The mitt also seems to break down pretty quickly and look dingy however it is still very usable despite it looking worn.</li>
            <li> This  tanning solution works, stays on for about a week( depends on your life style and how often you shower and rub your skin.My estimate is with min one shower per day and some water activities  during summer)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x60;t stain the bed sheets- though for the days I put it on I use chocolate brown satin set.&lt;br /&gt;Also goes on with no strikes( use lotion on palms, elbows, knees and feet), and has a very natural color.Looks lovely!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the glove.How can a manufacturer provide porous mitten for this? The whole idea is to block the product seeping through the palms and apply only on the skin.Beautisol has much better mittens- also sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;Also the scent is not so weird like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I have tried so many sunless tanning products and this is by far the best! It is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t streak, and smells great! The color is brown, NOT orange. The bottle will last forever too, since you don&#x27;t have to use much of it each time you apply. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, even had spray tan professionally done, and i still prefer this product. I put it on every other night after a bath and wake up golden. I cant stress how much i love this!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I have found the best tanning product by far. Even considering never tanning in the tanning bed again. :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is the best,by far.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different self tanners. This one is absolutely fantastic. There is a slight \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; smell after it has dried but it looks great. I have gotten more compliments on me tan than any other.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have tried pretty much every self-tanner out there and this stuff takes the cake!  After reading all of the great reviews, I had to try it....I was not disappointed!!!  The people I work with couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how tan I was and how natural it looked.  Do yourself a favor and just get it!!!</li>
            <li> I got this because i had recently hada baby &amp; didn&#x27;t have time to tan really  I can not be pale I prefer to be tan I personally like going to tanning salons even though I know it is bad for you..I was pleased with this product at first, it does give you a dark tan but you have to apply it 4 days in a row to achieve a deep rich tan that mimics what you get from a bed..I was exfoliating before first use then after 5 days and i would apply once in between..it doesnt peel off or isn&#x27;t patchy really although I had a problem with even color on my legs,i found that if you apply the color by spraying onto your gloves then patting on your legs it does make it a little bit more even but it still looked like i had something wrong with my skin on my legs that is what I do not like about it..plus you do look tan but i like to actually tan because then you are truly tan with the fake bake I felt like I was painting on my skin lol and I just personally prefer to tan in a tanning salon...if you are cool with painting on your tan instead of going to the beds because you feel it is soo bad for you then I recommend this product for you but if you love tanning in the beds and are just trying to get away from tanning in the beds I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this or any self tanner for that matter...jus tmy opinion...I am going to go get a tanning package today &amp; be reunited with my lost love of tanning in a bed lol</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s easy to use, it really is streak free, it looks completely natural.  Tip (put on before bed and rinse in the morning for best results)</li>
            <li> This is the best at home tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. If you apply in circular motions with the mit the color will blend beautifully and you will no doubt be satisfied with your deep glow!&lt;br /&gt;I have a 1yr old son who loves to pull himself up on my legs and of course needs to be carried sometimes. I made the mistake of applying my tan before I put him to bed and it inevitably stained his skin too! It scrubbed off easily but just a fair warning and reminder to mommys- make sure you apply after the babes are asleep!&lt;br /&gt;It does come off on clothes and bed sheets. That&#x27;s the only down side. It won&#x27;t come off on anything after your first shower though! Overall great product and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Quality product and blends well.Matched skin tones well also. I got one for a friend that has a bit darker skin than myself. She LOVES it!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Color looked natural. Doesn&#x27;t last long and a little washes off in the shower so apply extra. Apply at night works well. Apply moisturizer  before self tanner. Apply to clean skin. I would buy again &amp; I would recommend this product. Pleased</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner! I always recommend it to all my friends and will always buy this! Easy to apply, quick to dry, little to no scent, great color, and the color builds well if you apply it on consecutive days! Only draw back is it gets on your clothes sometimes if you are super sweaty/working out. I always try new self tanners to see if something better has come out yet, but I can honestly say this is the best I&#x27;ve found in my many, many purchases!</li>
            <li> One of the better products out there.  No funny smell, you can see where you&#x27;re putting it on.  I like the mitt but wish it were larger.  It does temporarily stain your clothes if you should perspire or around the necklines etc.  So far it&#x27;s washed out of everything.  NOTE: this is a spray and it is brown, read some people said it got all over - duh it is a spray and it is brown.  I spray it onto the mitt  holding the mitt in the bathroom sink and then rub it on to my legs and arms.  No problems - when done just rinse out the sink.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Does not give you that Orange look like some self tanners.  No streaks and doesn&#x27;t stink.  Color also lasts a several days and doesn&#x27;t come off blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: first day of application it does come off onto clothes (if you sweat or get wet) until you take shower than it is good.</li>
            <li> I got a set of  2 for about $20 which was an outstanding deal. Hands down, the best tanning prosecutor I&#x27;ve bought yet. Many reviews on YouTube. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of brand but this one so far the BEST! Actually smells good too! I will definatly recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This product does ggive a natural dark tan;however; it is messy to apply and you do need to bathe after it dries to get the access off, the mitt is a nice addition in smoothing out the affect.</li>
            <li> You can sent he color change as you are putting it on which helps to see missed areas. It has not made me look orange. Be sure and lotion or baby oil elbows knees and feet. It does last right at a week.</li>
            <li> I love fake bake the product came quickly and the price is so low. I use it daily it works best after showering and I always get compliments on my tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to apply incorrectly and is indeed golden and natural with NO orange at all. Product is a pump spray and you use the mitt  with the gloves on to apply and flawless without any streaks or overlap. It dries in seconds to an almost powder finish. Cons? Be very careful of overspray so do not do this on carpet or near anything textile. Since this isn&#x27;t a cream you have to wait until the next day or so and rinse off the bronzer before you moisturize or you&#x27;ll smear the bronzer around and it&#x27;ll come off onto anything and everything. Definitely after your tan is achieved you should shower the color off because if you were to say, get sprinkled on while walking to your car it&#x27;ll run in streaks like a cheap water color.&lt;br /&gt;Pros? Great color, easiest to apply and impossible to get a negative result and dries fast and I&#x27;m on day 3 and color still looks fresh and wears evenly. Oh, totally washes out of everything even if it looks like your robe is a total loss. I&#x27;ve found that holding the sprayer right up to my skin and give a few pumps then quickly blending before it runs down too far is much neater than spraying the mitt.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply. It dries almost instantly, and the color is a beautifully natural tan that you&#x27;d get from the beach.</li>
            <li> If I could give a half star, this would be a 4 1/2! I first tried Fake Bake a couple of weeks ago on the advice of a salesperson at Ulta. Finding it at Amazon for half price made stocking up here an easy decision. It&#x27;s different than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used before, and easy to get an all-over tan. I had never found a self-tanner I felt comfortable using all over because of streakiness, and I&#x27;ve used them in every price-range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular version (there are several) comes with a soft mitt and latex gloves to protect your hands from any cast-off color. Make sure you saturate the mitt fairly well; the color will transfer more easily. The tanner is infused with \\&quot;a cosmetic guide color\\&quot; so you can see where you&#x27;ve been, and blends flawlessly. The potion dries quickly and you can dress soon after applying, but I usually wear something loose while getting ready to go out. If you find you&#x27;ve missed a spot, it&#x27;s easy to correct, and if you&#x27;ve gone too crazy or colored \\&quot;outside the lines\\&quot; you can  wipe off your mistakes with a washcloth and a little soap and water. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or give off a quirky scent; however, later on I did notice a faint odor, but nothing like with tanning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and usually only before I shower off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of showering, the instructions advise an evening application before going to bed, with a cleanse in the A.M. Please Note: you will find color on your light-colored linens the next morning (don&#x27;t worry; it washes out), so I&#x27;ve started putting it on after my morning shower. I was surprised by how much color washed off (the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), but a truly-believable tan remains. For us light-skinned users, it is truly a miracle product!! I plan on trying the other products in the Fake Bake line, including the one for the face and the body polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Glorious</li>
            <li> Due to health conditions i&#x27;m unable to lay in a tanning bed...Fake Bake has Made my day i am tanned so good it Amaze&#x27;s me buying more now so can keep it going on....Thank&#x27;s so much...</li>
            <li> Great item fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolutely worst, does not do what it says it is supposed to do, It does give a nice color!  But, it does not stay permanent it washes off in the shower, it does not build a tan, no matter how long you leave it to dry after applying it, it still washes off.  What a waste of 25 bucks.  Very disappointed and will never ever buy FAKE and BAKE products again!  What a crock of bull!!!</li>
            <li> Like many others reviewing this product, I am extremely fair skinned and have never been happy with the orange color I turn using typical sunless products.  I am way too old to be messing around with the dangers of tanning beds or sitting in the sun; to say nothing of the time it would take to try to get any color with my fair skin!  I too was a bit skeptical when I purchased this the first time, expecting the same old orange, streaky, fake, stinky skin results of every other product out there.  I am SO impressed with this product, it is amazing!!  The application is made so easy because of the fact that you see where it is going, just like applying make up to your face, only better.  It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re applying a true sun produced golden glow that you see instantly!  And no stink!  Wow!  Who would have thought this were possible?  And I have had to go out in the rain soon after application a time or two and absolutely no streaking or fading.  Some fading occurs upon bathing, which is to be expected, of course.  Another thing to note is that I love how, if I was in a bit of hurry applying my fake bake, I can just go get it out and fix a spot I may have missed!  That simple!  I love that it shows up right away and then by morning, I look like I&#x27;m fresh from the beach!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had discovered this stuff a long time ago!  Thank you Fake Bake for finally producing a product that actually works for us glow-in-the-dark fair skinned folk.</li>
            <li> FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT!  Read the reviews, did my research and was still a little skeptical because the aroma of other self tanning products was still clinging to my nose as I looked at the orange results of other tanning products on my body.  FAKE BAKE IS EXCELLENT! Very easy to use, follow the directions, allow it to set overnight, rinse in the morning look gorgeous!  No bad aroma, no orange on the skin, no streaking, no bad anything.  I use it at least 3 times a week to keep myself looking healthy instead of my usual pasty, pasty white.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Exfoliation very helpful to clean the skin and prep for tan application, I apply FAKE BAKE by standing in the bath tub to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spray on anything else, I rinse the mitt in lukewarm water after I&#x27;ve finished applying the product.  While it is usually pretty dry to the touch on my body when I finish, but I still wear some long sleeve/long pant pajamas just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t color the sheets, etc. but it washes right out even if you get a little on something.  I encourage you to give a try and enjoy looking good this summer without risking over exposure to the sun for the same effect.  Thank you FAKE BAKE and, more importantly, thank you to all the consumers that write the reviews that guide the rest of us to products that really work.</li>
            <li> It is a great product The color is natural looking no orange at all I do however have a few things I dislike the after smell like all self tanners the smell is weird yes its good smell at 1st but after about 1hr you start to smell that weird off smell so about hour 3 I shower it off plus like all bronzesr it will rub off on stuff &amp; I do not like that If you get near water or you sweat you will see the spots . also make sure not to put this on any dry skin areas because it will show up DARK so if you get it on say elbos ankles wipe it off ! always add lightly on feet &amp; hands !! hope this helps</li>
            <li> The color result is great! THAT is most important!!  The hand mitt is what I have problems with. With small hands I find I have to pinch the mitt with my fingers to keep it on my hand.  I wish the mitt had some kind of finger holds on the inside while leaving the full mitt effect on the outside to have better hold of the mitt while using.</li>
            <li> Love this product and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Love this. Gives a natural looking tan.  You will get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> comes off on my clothes</li>
            <li> love this product does not streak gives a great natural tan color however does come off on clothes if you sweat.  I put mine on at night after a shower on clean skin. but when I work out in the mornings and sweat some will come off on my sports bra. other than that the stuff is worth it and great</li>
            <li> Love this product, no streak marks and it does not make your skin look orange.  Gives the look of a nice even tan!</li>
            <li> I have been using sunless tanners forever (I&#x27;m Irish). I have tried them all. I have been using this now only for the last 3 or so years. I love fake bake for when I don&#x27;t have a spray tan and or when I need a touch up. The mitt allows you to buff in the spray which is so much better than a tanning lotion, gel or cream. You can control the amount of tan you want. There is a &amp;#34;guiding&amp;#34; color that washes off in the shower. I wish it stayed on longer but other than that is super awesome. This is the cheapest I can find it too. Great deal. All of my friends are hooked now 😁!!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have tried. The seller was awesome as well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last but 1 day</li>
            <li> Works really well,  does seen to take a long time to thoroughly dry</li>
            <li> Well this stuff is amazing, it really does tan you up, I just need a little practice blending it in cause I kinda suck. But this stuff really works I woke up with this flawless tan took a shower in the morning and I it did bleed out once the water hit me but it looked even once I washed it off!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve tried MANY sunless tanning lotions/sprays/systems over the last 15 years and NOTHING compares to this! I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; freckled with auburn hair and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy anything else! It doesn&#x27;t look orange in anyway, makes u ACTUALLY LOOK TAN, A GREAT tan at that! Tons of ladies have asked me if I had been tanning and were shocked when they found out it was sunless &amp; then wanted to buy some for themselves. Best part is this stuff smells GOOD! Like lotion! This is THE ONLY BRAND that DOESNT HAVE THAT SUNLESS TANNING SMELL!!! I&#x27;m beyond impressed!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this self tanner. Goes on smooth and does not smell.</li>
            <li> As a recovering tanorexic, I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> perfect tan, just wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 love!  great stuff and non streaky!</li>
            <li> Fake bake works wonders! You must exfoliate before applying or it will not give you an even tan. Moisturize daily to extend the life of the tan</li>
            <li> The best tanning product available.  Great product, price, shipping and complete transaction.  I&#x27;ve reordered MANY times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I love this product. For those of you who say it washes out in the shower, I think that is the color guard that washes out, not the tan itself. What I have been doing which really helps is, after I use it and shower the next day, everyday after for my moisturizer, I use Jergens natural glow gradual tanner and this keeps my tan looking perfect everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used.  No unpleasant odor, easy to apply and love the natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t look orange.  Also doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.  Has that self-tanner smell after it&#x27;s been on for a while, but I think that&#x27;s unavoidable with all self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner on the market -- and I have used them all.  This tanner dries very quickly and does not rub off on sheets.  I use before vacations to warmer climes so I&#x27;m not pale when wearing short sleeves or capris.  Color lasts for several days.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. Would highly recommend this product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> works good but comes off easily when wet. color is nice though. I didn&#x27;t feel I had to exfoliate that much, just the usual shave.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and it goes on so nicely and dries quickly.  The only problem is it ruins white bras and underwear by turnig them a reddish color.  I am sure there is some sort of red die in the mix.  You never want to be caught out in the rain or have water splashed on you if you did the application that day.  The directions say to do the night before so you shower off in the morning, the only problem is the color is not near as good, but it will avoid streaks all over if you get splashed by water.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this product and it never stinks like feet!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best self tanner I have ever used. A quick list of pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great price!&lt;br /&gt;- Great scent initially, and no gnarly fake tan scent afterward.&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly and I did not experience transfer onto sheets or clothing after applying it for an overnight coat.&lt;br /&gt;- The color is natural - more of a slightly red base. It does not give off an orange/yellow or olive/green cast. I&#x27;ve got very fair skin and this makes me look just like I do after spending a week in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The liquid itself is dark in color, so I recommend applying this in the tub to rinse away any overspray. Or, spray over a towel.&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to put an oil or other lotion over your knuckles, knees, elbows and ankles. Just like any self tanner, it darkens these rough areas most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;- Read the directions and follow them exactly.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t panic when you shower after the first coat. You will see color go down the drain, but a base layer does stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;- The color indicator makes evert new application obvious, but the tan looks better after following the process for about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of people complained that the bottle leaked. It comes with a flat screw cap, and then a spritzing cap. Here&#x27;s my suggestion: when you take off the screw cap, just poke a small hole in the protectant seal, rather than removing the whole seal. Poke the spritzer &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; through this hole. My bottle doesn&#x27;t leak at all thanks to that.&lt;br /&gt;- This is a fake tanning product. If you want to maintain it - you have to maintain it. For the palest of pales (like myself), we will have to do this twice a week to keep a steady tan through the summer. But it beats the damage of a tanning bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! Enjoy!</li>
