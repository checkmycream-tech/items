            <li>Castor oil in general has always been good to me.</li>
            <li>its worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>I have purchased another bottle since my first use and gifted my hair dresser a bottle as well.</li>
            <li>On top of that she used a curling iron and burned my whole right side in many places.</li>
            <li>I am eager to see more positive changes over continuous use.</li>

            <li>Ok black women of America this stuff works wonderfully to help grow your hair back.  </li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars cause shipping was quick</li>
            <li>However, after my personal use, I only have AWESOME things to report.  </li>
            <li>shipment came in quick..</li>
            <li>It smells like a burnt wood (to me) but it quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be seeing a new doctor and getting some more blood work done</li>
            <li>The smell is too much and it didn&#x27;t wash easy from my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing out my eyebrows and eyelashes for months trying every product but this really works!!</li>
            <li>DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li>seeing alot of thickness &amp; less shedding &amp; it makes your hair sooooo soft... love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>I think it smells wonderful and when mixed with other oils(avocado, sweet almond....)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing , I use it everyday to keep my hair most and shinny</li>
            <li>I rarely ever use the oil.</li>
            <li>It came in earlier than expected and perfectly in tact.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best My hair is so thick</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li>LOVE MY RESULTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Only use on wet hair for the best results!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my natural hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth the price to stop hair loss and hopefully regrow my God given tresses.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my hair soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>Also helps greatly with edges which is where I am currently using it most due to having a baby 3 months ago and just now experiencing the postpartum shedding.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said you could expect good hair growth in  about four months.</li>
            <li>I will get the right one.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far !</li>
            <li>I find that sweet almond oil REALLY cuts the scent.</li>
            <li>Then I do an intense conditioning once a month with full strength coconut oil.</li>
            <li>certainly didn&#x27;t sell me on the product or company!  </li>
            <li>It is not extremely harsh even though it has somewhat of a strong smell.</li>
            <li>My hair works well with this because it becomes soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell, but that comes with being natural</li>
            <li>This product  has relieved the itch tremendously, but is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to try this out for the first time!..</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about this product and I have to agree that it is definitely something I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the results it really works!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular castor oil because it works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I still love using this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I first used the product on my husband lock</li>
            <li>results were noticed after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m NOT fully convinced that this is the REAL &amp;#34;Jamaican BLACK&amp;#34;  DEAL!</li>
            <li>I tried this out on my eyebrows when I first got it to see if it would help them grow and</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>exactly what blogs I read about</li>
            <li>Beyond that - it does exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, I started using it instantly and</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a smoky odor at first, but I don&#x27;t even notice it now.  </li>
            <li>My husband has never said anything about a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>I tried it as a hot oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love it , wish it came in a bigger bottle .</li>
            <li>(I mist my face first, then apply).</li>
            <li>This oil I&#x27;d great for natural black hair.</li>
            <li>This works great on everyone&#x27;s hair in my home no more breaking or frizz!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because I got busy, but recently started again, and it really is amazing how this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>so I know a good castor oil this is missing something!</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my curly-textured hair after shampoo.  </li>
            <li>What is amazing about it for me is that it makes my unruly gray hairs lie down</li>
            <li>I used the Jamaican black castor oil in my mixture when I created my own shea butter and coconut oil moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, I certainly will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>Really does help with hair growth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and products  was sealed.</li>
            <li>The cost of Jamaican Castor Oil is sooo much lower than Mira Hair Oil.  </li>
            <li>It has really work wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help much at all.</li>
            <li>I rub it into my scalp real well and comb it through the rest of my hair and then put my hair up in a bun and place a plastic cap over it and go to bed.</li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair oily, but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results as of yet</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes your hair and thickens it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Have been already using, couldnt find much difference in hair yet but lets see.</li>
            <li>Use this on the whole family&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Not the best smell, but I only use a few times during the week only on the scalp/bald spot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s really greasy and sticky</li>
            <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much and it grew.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of this product so much</li>
            <li>it really works</li>
            <li>it works very well on my eyelashes</li>
            <li>Love this product is working as expected</li>
            <li>It was really moisturizing so time will tell.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>This is really like a miracle oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is really oily and will soak through one pair.  </li>
            <li>I have sandal ready feet in about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Moisturises hair and scalp very well.</li>
            <li>This why I purchased this it works fast.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I  ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, I have notice some thickness and growth.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be real castor oil.</li>
            <li>I received really fast.</li>
            <li>Helps my hair grow fast .</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how much to use or how often.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>, they get a funny look on their face and ask how old was I when I got married.  </li>
            <li>Make your own hair care products that contain Jamaican black castor oil and save money!</li>
            <li>this oil (Jamaica black castor) is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>This also has many other benifits as well.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and you just have to get used to the smell lol &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>After trying so many other things, this oil did</li>
            <li>So While it seems your are getting some rare and exotic product, you really aren&#x27;t getting anything different than regular castor oil; only ashes of a plant have been added with no proof of being any more beneficial than regular castor oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my black Jamaicastoroil, now I wont live with out it thanks very much</li>
            <li>Not at thick as hair on my legs but pretty nice.</li>
            <li>And im not too sure if this is 100% the real thing because the scent is a little off compared to the ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>that his scalp stay&#x27;s dry with other products this is doing him good</li>
            <li>But this Jamaican Black Castor Oil does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I just took better care of my edges and put them in less tightening styles.</li>
            <li>appears to be the authentic Jamaican black castor oil seond time purchasing</li>
            <li>Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8 oz was packaged appropriately for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>(sardines in particular) and that helped with my scalp issues.  </li>
            <li>And its proven to regulate DHT which is one of the factors if not the main factor of hairloss in men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura dâ€™or shampoo.</li>
            <li>the main Product&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li>I think it has helped with regrowth at a steady rate.</li>
            <li>I used to have thick, silky, beautiful, long hair which has drastically fallen out over the years...  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>high  hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using for very long, however so far am enjoying the results using it as a scalp massage oil and also as a moisture sealer for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Bold spots are filling in and I&#x27;m getting new growth I can actually see.</li>
            <li>My hair is so, so soft and it has body once again!!</li>
            <li>I love it, only problem is it has a very strong smell, not pleasant at all!  </li>
            <li>so far, it looks like it really did help some.</li>
            <li>Thus far I have no complaints and it appears that it may suit my purpose very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really locks in the moisture for my kinky curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes still fall out as normal but now i dont have bald spots.</li>
            <li>It just seems thinner than normal</li>
            <li>Nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>In addition if you would like other techniques thatâ€™s not included in this list, feel free to email me and ask.&lt;br /&gt;Noblesupreme@outlook.com</li>
            <li>Great product, thick and yellow in color like true black caster oil.</li>
            <li>Very thick, you really should get some kind of appliicator to use with it</li>
            <li>After using about 2 to 3 times a week for 4 weeks, I noticed thicker hair and the area on my hairline appeared to be filling in with new hair.    </li>
            <li>and she had new hair growth.</li>
            <li>but she doesn&#x27;t live close by for me to get it from her.</li>
            <li>Its not harsh like other castor oils and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for my natural hair, and sometimes on my body too.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it on my skin by mixing it with a little skin cream and EVOO and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming ashy.</li>
            <li>I recieved my product very early.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>stuff costs too much to have a spinning lid that is barely held in place.  </li>
            <li>so why spend more money on a product that is truly no different than any other quality castor oil?</li>
            <li>Been using it once a week for the last month as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>If I happen to only mention that I have been married for 30 years</li>
            <li>This time around I feel complete disappointment.the bottle was a cheap plastic container,the oil extremely runny ,(</li>
            <li>Must have for natural hair!</li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong but like it so far for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair grew back and I LOVE the JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL.  </li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;d purchase the Jamaican Black Castor Oil &amp; it worked so much better had improvement within two weeks &amp; only for $9.</li>
            <li>I only made it about 45 days, but my hair grew a little more than an inch.</li>
            <li>This product on the other hand smell or oder is off, it is not as strong which makes me think it has possibly been diluted with another oil.</li>
            <li>It makes my 4A hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my old faithful.</li>
            <li>it makes hair so soft .must</li>
            <li>and it kept them soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It stops my dandruff completely</li>
            <li>A staple oil in my natural hair routine.</li>
            <li>I preferably like the green vibrance line ( available on</li>
            <li>, This pills are all natural and it battles the hair loss from within also.</li>
            <li>( all natural ingredients )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for natural hair usage.</li>
            <li>Upon using this product I was truly surprised at the thickness of the oil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone trying to thicken hair and of course to the all Natural sistas out there.</li>
            <li>When my wife uses it on her hair, her hair shine looks natural.</li>
            <li>Natural hair, I use it on my edges for strenght and on the length of the strands and ends to seal moisture.</li>
            <li>It has been 2 weeks so far and the oil is used in conjunction with a derma roller also purchased through prime.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s too late to update on the progress with the stress area, I already love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and also it looks like it cleared up some acne i had on my forehead and near my hairline..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will work for my hair growth</li>
            <li>my hair really benefited from daily use.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s how I knew it was 100% natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;get busy oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>She put it on her scalp every night for about two months and, wow,</li>
            <li>I am all natural.</li>
            <li>Just get it and apply it to your scalp twice a week, in the early part of the day</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to start using this while my natural hair is in protective style</li>
            <li>I buy this for my girl, she uses it on her natural hair</li>
            <li>the oil does break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is used as a collaboration of products for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>But when I started to use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I noticed very quickly it was helping my eyebrows grow back in!  </li>
            <li>I have only been using Jamaican Black Castor oil along with Strong roots palmetto oil for a month</li>
            <li>A little surely goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shedding excessive hair for several years, including my eyebrows (they were mostly gone).  </li>
            <li>I order this product back on March of this year,I reordered again last week.the first time in march</li>
            <li>I am 23 and of Native American decent</li>
            <li>It would be helpful to have a dropper or top with a smaller opening to pour small amounts on to your scalp or skin without spilling it.</li>
            <li>(my hopes are not high), but at the very least I&#x27;m happy to be getting my eyebrows back and can stop looking into eyebrow tattoos!</li>
            <li>Bought to grow my shoulder length hair longer and it not only has grown a couple inches in a month, my hair is now incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and needed...</li>
            <li>My hair soaks it in so much that it is almost dry in that hour.  </li>
            <li>but when i rinsed my hair it left it really soft.it left my hair greasy and the smoky smell disappeared</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as thick as before, but definitely getting better.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is made of thick glass, but flimsy is too strong a word to describe this dang lid.  </li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong and the consistency as thick either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a MAJOR improvement</li>
            <li>Kind of thick but mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so enjoy your restoration.</li>
            <li>Works amazing but smells really weird</li>
            <li>Now I see hairs growing in places along my eyebrow area that had been bare for years.  </li>
            <li>It is not a miracle elixir but if use frequently you will notice a difference in not only the growth but also the thickness of our hair.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only been using this on my scalp.</li>
            <li>As I said I only use it on my scalp, but when I massage it in, some of it gets on the hair nearest to the scalp and that hair always feels really soft.</li>
            <li>I think it is working and helping to grow in bare spots</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much, MUCH thicker oil than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have a low natural hair style and micro braids had taken my edges out.</li>
            <li>and my edges have grown back completely.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughters hair was ripped from her scalp last month .</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss that I&#x27;ve been experiencing since I was 17 years old.</li>
            <li>I have course hair and using neutrogena leave-in triple moisturizer along with extra virgin coconut oil helps keep my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and light..</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of black castor oil.</li>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;ve seen and felt a difference in my hair when it comes to thickness but other than that nothing else really.</li>
            <li>This oil is so rich and thick</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s thick &amp; rich</li>
            <li>Thick, rich and nourishing for my hair.</li>
            <li>It did control my dandruff to a certain extend and cut down my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and my curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this same product from other venders at different times but in a smaller quantity and in both cases they had the exact same smell, consistency,  and color.</li>
            <li>Works well for dry skin and makes your hair soft</li>
            <li>I would encourage future buyers not to get caught in the hype of Black Castor oil when it&#x27;s doing the same exact thing as regular castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed for me, when using too much of this product, i developed a massive headache, so that why I indicated that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Very thick so go light, so may need to mix with a lighter oil.</li>
            <li>and I read good and bad reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it daily for approximately 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a huge growth spurt, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Some complain about the smell and while I&#x27;ll say it isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff, the smell is tolerable and people tend to mix it with a coconut or tea tree oil.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found a decently priced vendor for this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good source of oil and makes my dry hair feel great.  </li>
            <li> Very good oil for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I retained a full inch in 20 days of use!</li>
            <li> It is also used in collaboration with six other oils &amp; an essence to provide a wonderful product used on my skin- all over.</li>
            <li> but It wasn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>

            <li> does have  strong wood scent some compare to tobacco</li>
            <li> The aroma is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Working fine for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> Like it very much!!</li>
            <li> I add other oils to blend in with the fragrance, which is not horrible, but not the most pleasant.  </li>
            <li> and it was not wrapped to secure.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels so smooth and moisturized..</li>

            <li> Castor oil in general has always been good to me.</li>
            <li> its worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I have purchased another bottle since my first use and gifted my hair dresser a bottle as well.</li>
            <li> On top of that she used a curling iron and burned my whole right side in many places.</li>
            <li> I am eager to see more positive changes over continuous use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks for me and so far I love it!</li>

            <li> love this product and it has really help my hair, I have all my friend use it.</li>

            <li> I use this once a week on my hair and face in winter because my skin gets too dry and flaky in winter and this oil acts as wonderful natural moisturizer..</li>
            <li> Ok black women of America this stuff works wonderfully to help grow your hair back.  </li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars cause shipping was quick</li>
            <li> However, after my personal use, I only have AWESOME things to report.  </li>
            <li> shipment came in quick..</li>
            <li> It smells like a burnt wood (to me) but it quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be seeing a new doctor and getting some more blood work done</li>
            <li> The smell is too much and it didn&#x27;t wash easy from my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my eyebrows and eyelashes for months trying every product but this really works!!</li>
            <li> DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li> seeing alot of thickness &amp; less shedding &amp; it makes your hair sooooo soft... love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think it smells wonderful and when mixed with other oils(avocado, sweet almond....)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , I use it everyday to keep my hair most and shinny</li>
            <li> I rarely ever use the oil.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than expected and perfectly in tact.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best My hair is so thick</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY RESULTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Only use on wet hair for the best results!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my natural hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth the price to stop hair loss and hopefully regrow my God given tresses.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li> Also helps greatly with edges which is where I am currently using it most due to having a baby 3 months ago and just now experiencing the postpartum shedding.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said you could expect good hair growth in  about four months.</li>
            <li> I will get the right one.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far !</li>
            <li> I find that sweet almond oil REALLY cuts the scent.</li>
            <li> Then I do an intense conditioning once a month with full strength coconut oil.</li>
            <li> certainly didn&#x27;t sell me on the product or company!  </li>
            <li> It is not extremely harsh even though it has somewhat of a strong smell.</li>
            <li> My hair works well with this because it becomes soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell, but that comes with being natural</li>
            <li> This product  has relieved the itch tremendously, but is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to try this out for the first time!..</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and I have to agree that it is definitely something I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the results it really works!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular castor oil because it works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I still love using this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I first used the product on my husband lock</li>
            <li> results were noticed after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m NOT fully convinced that this is the REAL &amp;#34;Jamaican BLACK&amp;#34;  DEAL!</li>
            <li> I tried this out on my eyebrows when I first got it to see if it would help them grow and</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> exactly what blogs I read about</li>
            <li> Beyond that - it does exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I started using it instantly and</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a smoky odor at first, but I don&#x27;t even notice it now.  </li>
            <li> My husband has never said anything about a funny smell.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as a hot oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it , wish it came in a bigger bottle .</li>
            <li> (I mist my face first, then apply).</li>
            <li> This oil I&#x27;d great for natural black hair.</li>
            <li> This works great on everyone&#x27;s hair in my home no more breaking or frizz!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I got busy, but recently started again, and it really is amazing how this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> so I know a good castor oil this is missing something!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my curly-textured hair after shampoo.  </li>
            <li> What is amazing about it for me is that it makes my unruly gray hairs lie down</li>
            <li> I used the Jamaican black castor oil in my mixture when I created my own shea butter and coconut oil moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, I certainly will continue to use this product.</li>

            <li> Make your own hair care products that contain Jamaican black castor oil and save money!</li>
            <li> this oil (Jamaica black castor) is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This also has many other benifits as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you just have to get used to the smell lol &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> After trying so many other things, this oil did</li>
            <li> So While it seems your are getting some rare and exotic product, you really aren&#x27;t getting anything different than regular castor oil; only ashes of a plant have been added with no proof of being any more beneficial than regular castor oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my black Jamaicastoroil, now I wont live with out it thanks very much</li>
            <li> Not at thick as hair on my legs but pretty nice.</li>
            <li> And im not too sure if this is 100% the real thing because the scent is a little off compared to the ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> that his scalp stay&#x27;s dry with other products this is doing him good</li>
            <li> But this Jamaican Black Castor Oil does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> I just took better care of my edges and put them in less tightening styles.</li>
            <li> appears to be the authentic Jamaican black castor oil seond time purchasing</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8 oz was packaged appropriately for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> (sardines in particular) and that helped with my scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> And its proven to regulate DHT which is one of the factors if not the main factor of hairloss in men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura dâ€™or shampoo.</li>
            <li> the main Product&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li> I think it has helped with regrowth at a steady rate.</li>
            <li> I used to have thick, silky, beautiful, long hair which has drastically fallen out over the years...  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> high  hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for very long, however so far am enjoying the results using it as a scalp massage oil and also as a moisture sealer for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Bold spots are filling in and I&#x27;m getting new growth I can actually see.</li>
            <li> My hair is so, so soft and it has body once again!!</li>
            <li> I love it, only problem is it has a very strong smell, not pleasant at all!  </li>
            <li> so far, it looks like it really did help some.</li>
            <li> Thus far I have no complaints and it appears that it may suit my purpose very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really locks in the moisture for my kinky curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes still fall out as normal but now i dont have bald spots.</li>
            <li> It just seems thinner than normal</li>
            <li> Nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> In addition if you would like other techniques thatâ€™s not included in this list, feel free to email me and ask.&lt;br /&gt;Noblesupreme@outlook.com</li>
            <li> Great product, thick and yellow in color like true black caster oil.</li>
            <li> Very thick, you really should get some kind of appliicator to use with it</li>
            <li> After using about 2 to 3 times a week for 4 weeks, I noticed thicker hair and the area on my hairline appeared to be filling in with new hair.    </li>
            <li> and she had new hair growth.</li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t live close by for me to get it from her.</li>
            <li> Its not harsh like other castor oils and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for my natural hair, and sometimes on my body too.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it on my skin by mixing it with a little skin cream and EVOO and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming ashy.</li>
            <li> I recieved my product very early.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> stuff costs too much to have a spinning lid that is barely held in place.  </li>
            <li> so why spend more money on a product that is truly no different than any other quality castor oil?</li>
            <li> Been using it once a week for the last month as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> If I happen to only mention that I have been married for 30 years</li>
            <li> This time around I feel complete disappointment.the bottle was a cheap plastic container,the oil extremely runny ,(</li>
            <li> Must have for natural hair!</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong but like it so far for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grew back and I LOVE the JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL.  </li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d purchase the Jamaican Black Castor Oil &amp; it worked so much better had improvement within two weeks &amp; only for $9.</li>
            <li> I only made it about 45 days, but my hair grew a little more than an inch.</li>
            <li> This product on the other hand smell or oder is off, it is not as strong which makes me think it has possibly been diluted with another oil.</li>
            <li> It makes my 4A hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my old faithful.</li>
            <li> it makes hair so soft .must</li>
            <li> and it kept them soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It stops my dandruff completely</li>
            <li> A staple oil in my natural hair routine.</li>
            <li> I preferably like the green vibrance line ( available on</li>
            <li> , This pills are all natural and it battles the hair loss from within also.</li>
            <li> ( all natural ingredients )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for natural hair usage.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I was truly surprised at the thickness of the oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone trying to thicken hair and of course to the all Natural sistas out there.</li>
            <li> When my wife uses it on her hair, her hair shine looks natural.</li>
            <li> Natural hair, I use it on my edges for strenght and on the length of the strands and ends to seal moisture.</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks so far and the oil is used in conjunction with a derma roller also purchased through prime.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s too late to update on the progress with the stress area, I already love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> and also it looks like it cleared up some acne i had on my forehead and near my hairline..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will work for my hair growth</li>
            <li> my hair really benefited from daily use.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s how I knew it was 100% natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;get busy oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> She put it on her scalp every night for about two months and, wow,</li>
            <li> I am all natural.</li>
            <li> Just get it and apply it to your scalp twice a week, in the early part of the day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start using this while my natural hair is in protective style</li>
            <li> I buy this for my girl, she uses it on her natural hair</li>
            <li> the oil does break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is used as a collaboration of products for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> But when I started to use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I noticed very quickly it was helping my eyebrows grow back in!  </li>
            <li> I have only been using Jamaican Black Castor oil along with Strong roots palmetto oil for a month</li>
            <li> A little surely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shedding excessive hair for several years, including my eyebrows (they were mostly gone).  </li>
            <li> I order this product back on March of this year,I reordered again last week.the first time in march</li>
            <li> I am 23 and of Native American decent</li>
            <li> It would be helpful to have a dropper or top with a smaller opening to pour small amounts on to your scalp or skin without spilling it.</li>
            <li> (my hopes are not high), but at the very least I&#x27;m happy to be getting my eyebrows back and can stop looking into eyebrow tattoos!</li>
            <li> Bought to grow my shoulder length hair longer and it not only has grown a couple inches in a month, my hair is now incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and needed...</li>
            <li> My hair soaks it in so much that it is almost dry in that hour.  </li>
            <li> but when i rinsed my hair it left it really soft.it left my hair greasy and the smoky smell disappeared</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as thick as before, but definitely getting better.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is made of thick glass, but flimsy is too strong a word to describe this dang lid.  </li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong and the consistency as thick either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a MAJOR improvement</li>
            <li> Kind of thick but mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so enjoy your restoration.</li>
            <li> Works amazing but smells really weird</li>
            <li> Now I see hairs growing in places along my eyebrow area that had been bare for years.  </li>
            <li> It is not a miracle elixir but if use frequently you will notice a difference in not only the growth but also the thickness of our hair.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only been using this on my scalp.</li>
            <li> As I said I only use it on my scalp, but when I massage it in, some of it gets on the hair nearest to the scalp and that hair always feels really soft.</li>
            <li> I think it is working and helping to grow in bare spots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much, MUCH thicker oil than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a low natural hair style and micro braids had taken my edges out.</li>
            <li> and my edges have grown back completely.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughters hair was ripped from her scalp last month .</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss that I&#x27;ve been experiencing since I was 17 years old.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and using neutrogena leave-in triple moisturizer along with extra virgin coconut oil helps keep my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and light..</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;ve seen and felt a difference in my hair when it comes to thickness but other than that nothing else really.</li>
            <li> This oil is so rich and thick</li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s thick &amp; rich</li>
            <li> Thick, rich and nourishing for my hair.</li>
            <li> It did control my dandruff to a certain extend and cut down my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and my curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this same product from other venders at different times but in a smaller quantity and in both cases they had the exact same smell, consistency,  and color.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin and makes your hair soft</li>
            <li> I would encourage future buyers not to get caught in the hype of Black Castor oil when it&#x27;s doing the same exact thing as regular castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed for me, when using too much of this product, i developed a massive headache, so that why I indicated that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very thick so go light, so may need to mix with a lighter oil.</li>
            <li> and I read good and bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it daily for approximately 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a huge growth spurt, so</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to moisturize your hair,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the oil is really thick and it is easy to have a heavy hand</li>
            <li> I have to say that did really help with the excessive hair shedding.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it just yet.</li>
            <li> , it seals my ends and gives my hair a shine, and it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> If it is too thick for your hair texter, you can mix with finer oil like coconut or avocado oil, or just use it as a hot oil treatment......</li>
            <li> I lost a small patch of eyebrow hair a few days ago, but I use the castor oil every night and it&#x27;s filling back in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned up my diet considerably, cutting out most sugar and grains that cause inflammation, started eating fish several times per week</li>
            <li> The Chemo drugs after effects had left my hair dry and feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a product that helps my skin feel soft and seals in hydration</li>
            <li> I looked at it to try and find a product that would make my mom&#x27;s super thin hair thicker.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really say at this time.</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long way and your hair will retain moisture for three to four days.**Important</li>
            <li> One drastic change was my hair thinning at an alarming rate and growing back at a snails pace if at all in some places.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long emough to rate.</li>
            <li> There was no &#x27;strong odor&#x27; and it mixed very well with my other hair/skin care products!!</li>
            <li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> its very thick and has a weird smell, I cut it with some almond oil and that helps since I have thin hair, but i must say i love this stuff, when I run out I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have not used the product long enough to give it any other rating.</li>
            <li> The lavender one smells a little stronger and smells mostly of lavender with a faint hint of ashes</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a distinct smell, is thick and a little sticky---but I like it.</li>
            <li> I suffered from extremely dry scalp</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that has dry scalp.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really been helping keep my hair from drying out in this ridiculous winter air.</li>
            <li> In addition, I also used it on my ends which were dry</li>
            <li> This oil helped my dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, I&#x27;m using as a repair lotion/ moisturizer for my dry damaged skin..</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for your scalp and, along with some essential oils, helped get rid of annoying dandruff and helped my husband thicken his hairline.</li>
            <li> so putting it on every night would not work for me, but I do put it on my scalp and all through my dry hair</li>
            <li> have really dry, flaky feet and nothing has helped.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, so it helps moisturize her scalp and minimizes dandruff.</li>
            <li> I pour some into a smaller squeeze bottle and only a few drops are needed.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my staple products for my thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality thick castor oil..</li>
            <li> Very thick does NOT seem watered down and received it quick,</li>
            <li> but I thought I had ordered the extra dark jbco.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will work as well as the extra dark</li>
            <li> So, I figured what do I have to loose.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the smell...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a month and a half later</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount, so the bottle last awhile.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected to be..</li>
            <li> To cut the story short you must apply a Green drink (vegetable &amp; fruit) to your regiments.</li>
            <li> not really noticing a difference but hopeful</li>
            <li> The only con is that it is a heavy oil</li>
            <li> I file my feet briefly and mix a few drops of this oil in my cocoa butter gel, rub on my feet and then put on two footies or socks.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like unprocessed wheat (and I don&#x27;t know what that smells like)</li>
            <li> Seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned significantly and my scalp was red and painful.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i put  a little on my eyelashes, they are so long and thicker.</li>
            <li> Then after I purchased it I read the color is due to ash added so that also changed my perspective on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product on my edges, which are thinning due to weaves and perms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically to assist in the regrowth of area thinned out due to clip in extensions and heat application on &amp;#34;leave out&amp;#34; for a style I just had.</li>
            <li> edges other than give you oily skin prone to breakouts if you have acne.</li>
            <li> A small amount around the edges of my hair does the same.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It is extremely oily </li>
            <li> Look online for a ton of other beauty uses.</li>
            <li> I do prefer using it alone and not with other products.</li>
            <li> the consistency of olive oil) and barely any of the common castor oil smell.</li>
            <li> If you have thin edges rub this castor on your scalp on a regular basis and your hair will grow back!!</li>
            <li> My hair grew back, not as thick and minus hair in the crown and my front hair line.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s very conditioning and thick leaves hair shiney and moisturized, but I cannot tolerate the smell, and I don&#x27;t my hair smelling like it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long thick and extremely dry</li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way for this product, so please don&#x27;t be heavy handed</li>
            <li> so idk people are skeptical about if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s verg moisturizing, it has a thick earthy scent so add an essential oil (lavender, peppermint or Rosemary or all of them) to cut the tinge.</li>
            <li> Only thing is its thick af.</li>
            <li> I have tight cocky dry hair!</li>
            <li> I believe this oil healed my dry unhealthy scalp and has helped my hair grow back stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> and it weighs down my  hair.</li>
            <li> I bought Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> and they are less visible.</li>
            <li> jamaican black castor oil is my go to oil.</li>
            <li> bring this up because, &amp;#34;Jamaican Black Castor Oil&amp;#34; can get pricey-</li>
            <li> My order arrived in a plastic bottle instead of glass like my previous orders.</li>
            <li> and I have half a bottle now that it is the end of August.</li>
            <li> but has a slight scent to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been oiling my scalp with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m assuming it would smell like Jamacian Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps in the sheen and  sealing of my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish the prices on the Jamaican brands were a little less.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t put a tight seal on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy oil and the smell is less than desirable.</li>
            <li> Nothing was working and besides looking like a fried uneven singed mess..</li>
            <li> Its odor a little bit undesirable, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> yes it smells a little</li>
            <li> but i find that warming it a little helps</li>
            <li> Because of the way I lost my hair, this product could be working a little slower for me.</li>
            <li> It is heavy so a little is all you need.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to place the oil on my scalp and not on my locks, it the oil is somewhat thick.  </li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but I add in a few drops of peppermint oil and that solves the problem.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday and applied them to my eyebrows at night and let it sit there.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you donâ€™t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier</li>
            <li> I was put on different steroid creams for almost 3 yrs and my skin became so addicted to steroid creams that I was not able to stop using them..</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s very thick with a dark roasted aroma.., mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit weird, but that&#x27;s how it smells in general, and it also fades.</li>
            <li> My face has broken out quite terribly, but it&#x27;s been so good for my scalp, that I don&#x27;t want to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Please note, this stuff is thick and has a slight burnt/woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> Rub a little bit on your scalp Preferably twice a day, if you cant at least once at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband would joke about my &amp;#34;doberman pincher eyebrows&amp;#34; because they were getting so small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what this oil is suppose to do</li>
            <li> but I gave only a 3 star because I am skeptical about the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the smoky smell.</li>
            <li> They usually guess 38.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they put in this stuff</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my husband and son&#x27;s small bald spot with immediate results as well.</li>
            <li> So far its been disappointing.</li>
            <li> A small portion of cancer survivors do experience  permanent hair loss which I found out after the fact.</li>
            <li> Get YOURSELF a bottle of BLACK CASTOR OIL !!&lt;</li>
            <li> Doctor tell me not to worry but a whole scalp braid was pulled and its been a month and no peach fuzz :( .</li>
            <li> and I hardly lose any hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kina hard to describe the smell....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchase a hair care set to fix some hair loss for approximately $180 &amp; it worked a little within a two month time spend.</li>
            <li> at least an inch a month....</li>
            <li> It also has an odor that I&#x27;m really not thrilled about at all.</li>
            <li> hoping this products at least helps.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day late</li>
            <li> The oil is thick, but not too thick.</li>
            <li> I had terrible shedding and some breakage I began using regular cold pressed Hexane free castor oil.</li>
            <li> It is a slow growth process though.</li>
            <li> This product is thick and creamy...</li>
            <li> Bought hoping for thick hair, or would probably do that eventually.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thick when i put it on my scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so though moisturizing for hair an skin thick consistency</li>
            <li> But it is thick and smelly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the oil to be as thick as it is, nor was I expecting it to smell like it does</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and it does have a smell</li>
            <li> I had thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this instead of gel because it&#x27;s so thick .</li>
            <li> He has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this in the past - but not experienced this.</li>
            <li> A little thick and has a weird smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not because the smell is WAY too offensive to use regularly :(</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars  because for some reason this batch I bought smells like serious tobacco.</li>
            <li> Having had a serious dry, itchy scalp from childhood, I  was desperate for relief.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing?</li>
            <li> If used consistently it does help with hair growth smells terrible though so</li>
            <li> Product is very thick..</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> the oil is very thick like a cooking oil, it has a burnt ash smell to it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this oil to anyone who&#x27;s having problems with thin hair or thin edges.</li>
            <li> My sides are thin.</li>
            <li> (not great...</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not an unbearable smell, it&#x27;s just not particularly attractive.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been wearing  braids and pinning  them over the thin spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I think those reviews are false</li>
            <li> Although it comes out real thick and gooey, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way on your hair....surprisingly lightweight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> The Mira Oil is hugely expensive.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience at the salon, where the Beautician not only chopped my hair and stripped my hair color.</li>
            <li> Ill just wait and see.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It thickens my thin spot!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at 1st about the differences</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t bald, they were very thin but the castor oil immediately started working.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me a three month trial of Viviscal (I was hesitant to start an expensive vitamin routine, but at this point I&#x27;m desperate).</li>
            <li> I bought this as a hair treatment and my god, it made my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t like JBCO for some reason which is depressing.</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for not ordering this stuff a lot sooner.  </li>
            <li> My hair broken off very bad, I could see my scalp.  </li>
            <li> You get used to it, though, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad smell, but works.</li>
            <li> I have really bad scalp build up</li>
            <li> that would make my scalp smell bad and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to smell so bad</li>
            <li> Smell is not that bad</li>
            <li> Hope the results will change soon :-(  </li>
            <li> I literally hate the smell ðŸ˜«</li>
            <li> but its STINKS!!!!!!!!!! i will have to buy nose plugs to continue using this product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!!!! I suffered from extremely dry scalp and I started using this as a mixture with Vitamin E oil and it keeps my scalp moist and my hair started to grow back.  I recommend this product to anyone that has dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about three weeks into using this for hair regrowth. I&#x27;ve been shedding excessive hair for several years, including my eyebrows (they were mostly gone).  All blood work tests come back &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  My hair has thinned significantly and my scalp was red and painful.  Since doctors don&#x27;t care about hair loss, I set out to figure it out on my own.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve cleaned up my diet considerably, cutting out most sugar and grains that cause inflammation, started eating fish several times per week (sardines in particular) and that helped with my scalp issues.  My mom bought me a three month trial of Viviscal (I was hesitant to start an expensive vitamin routine, but at this point I&#x27;m desperate). I have to say that did really help with the excessive hair shedding.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep taking those.  But when I started to use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I noticed very quickly it was helping my eyebrows grow back in!  My husband would joke about my &amp;#34;doberman pincher eyebrows&amp;#34; because they were getting so small.  Now I see hairs growing in places along my eyebrow area that had been bare for years.  They&#x27;re not as thick as before, but definitely getting better.  I lost a small patch of eyebrow hair a few days ago, but I use the castor oil every night and it&#x27;s filling back in quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my scalp but I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference with the hair on my head yet.  But it stands to reason that if it helps my eyebrows it would have to do something for the rest of my hair.  Time will tell.  I&#x27;m going to be seeing a new doctor and getting some more blood work done (my hopes are not high), but at the very least I&#x27;m happy to be getting my eyebrows back and can stop looking into eyebrow tattoos!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and I have to agree that it is definitely something I will purchase again!! There was no &#x27;strong odor&#x27; and it mixed very well with my other hair/skin care products!! I have been telling all of my co-workers and family members about the product. This product will definitely be a staple in household.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle .. It&#x27;s a good oil that helps restoring hair health and conditions from root ..</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair line looks better and my scalp is more moisturized. I strongly recommend this if you are looking for a good way to keep your scalp from being too dry.</li>
            <li> Really does help with hair growth. It is not a miracle elixir but if use frequently you will notice a difference in not only the growth but also the thickness of our hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! Been using for almost a year in my mix of daily hair oil concoctions!!! Really moisturize your hair and help grow your hair out!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and it&#x27;s really been helping keep my hair from drying out in this ridiculous winter air. It&#x27;s helping my hair&#x27;s texture as well! Only bad thing? It doesn&#x27;t smell nice in the slightest. You get used to it, though, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> this oil (Jamaica black castor) is great for dry hair.You don&#x27;t need much to moisturize your hair,a little goes a long way. Also great for your feet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and products  was sealed.</li>
            <li> what can I say this stuff is as good as every.  It makes my 4A hair soft and manageable.  It also thickens up the eyebrows and eyelashes and it helps with Eczema so it has many uses....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this oil for 5 years now and it is a staple in my hair care and it&#x27;s my old faithful.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it literaly helps my hair grow and my eyelashes! I couldn&#x27;t believe the results it really works!</li>
            <li> Since there were questions about the authenticity of this product, and since it isn&#x27;t offered through Amazon itself, I decided NOT to purchase this from any of the sellers here. Instead I purchased it from Tropic Isle Living&#x27;s website, as I figured it would be safest coming from the brand itself.  I bought Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil. They come in glass bottles. The oil is thick, but not too thick. The color is brown and reminds me of maple syrup. The scent reminds me of cigarette smoke but It wasn&#x27;t a strong smell. The lavender one smells a little stronger and smells mostly of lavender with a faint hint of ashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only been using this on my scalp. I just pour some into the lid and then dip my finger in it and oil my scalp and massage it in. As I said I only use it on my scalp, but when I massage it in, some of it gets on the hair nearest to the scalp and that hair always feels really soft. I like it and will continue to use it and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> its a wonderful oil it does work i can see the result within 3 weeks n it makes hair so soft .must try.</li>
            <li> So many rave reviews, which is why I purchased this to begin with. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had terrible shedding and some breakage I began using regular cold pressed Hexane free castor oil. It not only immediately stopped the shedding it jump started my hair growth in no time. I was extremely impressed. In addition, I also used it on my ends which were dry and it kept them soft and hydrated. When I ran out I decided to give this a try and I can&#x27;t say I am impressed at all with JBCO it just didn&#x27;t give me the same results as my regular castor oil I&#x27;m sorry to say. Then after I purchased it I read the color is due to ash added so that also changed my perspective on this product. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular castor oil because it works much better for me.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  I used to buy the Mira Hair Oil.  The Mira Oil is hugely expensive. It did control my dandruff to a certain extend and cut down my hair loss.  But this Jamaican Black Castor Oil does a much better job.  It stops my dandruff completely and I hardly lose any hair anymore.  Wish I have known about it sooner.  The cost of Jamaican Castor Oil is sooo much lower than Mira Hair Oil.  I truly appreciate this product.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good! It is soo good! I swear I would swim in this stuff if I could!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s verg moisturizing, it has a thick earthy scent so add an essential oil (lavender, peppermint or Rosemary or all of them) to cut the tinge.</li>
            <li> I love the JBCO .  It has really work wonders for my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it was was fault but I thought I had ordered the extra dark jbco. but I got the all purpose one and it was not wrapped to secure.  Some of it had leaked out.  I don&#x27;t know if this will work as well as the extra dark but I will keep it and hope the next time I order it I will get the right one.</li>
            <li> Grows eyebrows, hair, and thinning edges. Be constant and you&#x27;ll see results. This also has many other benifits as well. Buyer for life.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil I have used date also fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Jamaican Black Castor oil along with Strong roots palmetto oil for a month and I have seen good results. It is a slow growth process though.</li>
            <li> great for thickening hair awesome love JA product</li>
            <li> Very thick, you really should get some kind of appliicator to use with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not because the smell is WAY too offensive to use regularly :(</li>
            <li> A staple for me! Love it!</li>
            <li> Quality product that yields excellent results. Go to YouTube to see lots of reviews and before and afters.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my lotions and hair products - I like it.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you donâ€™t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughtersâ€™ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my sisterlocks.  My hair is soft/fine and this has helped with the locking process.  Although it comes out real thick and gooey, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way on your hair....surprisingly lightweight.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing..</li>
            <li> A staple oil in my natural hair routine. I absolutely love this oil &amp; use it in my hair oil mix. Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Great Value and product.</li>
            <li> This product is thick and creamy...its a staple product in my cupboard for my hair care. Its not harsh like other castor oils and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended..This is a high quality thick castor oil..Exactly as I expected to be..I use this once a week on my hair and face in winter because my skin gets too dry and flaky in winter and this oil acts as wonderful natural moisturizer..I earlier had severe dandruff and eczema issues and used to visit dermatologist so often and none of the medications worked..I was put on different steroid creams for almost 3 yrs and my skin became so addicted to steroid creams that I was not able to stop using them.. Someone suggested to apply this castor oil when I did some research on google..I apply it on my scalp and face and leave it overnight or for atleast 3-4 hrs before taking bath..It works like a charm..my skin feels so smooth and moisturized..</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience at the salon, where the Beautician not only chopped my hair and stripped my hair color. On top of that she used a curling iron and burned my whole right side in many places. I had tried so many products in hopes that it would help remain my straw brittle hair. Nothing was working and besides looking like a fried uneven singed mess..my hair was now breaking off and there was hair everywhere. I had tried using Coconut oil treatments. It didn&#x27;t help much at all. Then while looking on U tube I came across videos of people saying how J.B.C.O. was close to a miracle in growing back and restoring their hair. So, I figured what do I have to loose. I gave it a try. Omg!!! This stuff really works!!! I have been using it in my hair every two nights. I rub it into my scalp real well and comb it through the rest of my hair and then put my hair up in a bun and place a plastic cap over it and go to bed. I have to say..that I&#x27;ve seen a lot of hairs growing in where I had none. My hair is so, so soft and it has body once again!! It looks 90 percent better and with continued use I&#x27;m sure it will continue to work its magic.</li>
            <li> Love love love. Great product. It came fast in the mail. It also makes your scalp very healthy.</li>

            <li> Love this. works for me. I wish the prices on the Jamaican brands were a little less.</li>
            <li> It came within two days and is a great product. I started using it three weeks ago to promote growth to my hair edges and my edges are growing back in. Will be biting another bottle soon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really say at this time. I&#x27;ve only been using it daily for approximately 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a huge growth spurt, so Ill just wait and see. I&#x27;ve heard and read a lot of good things about it, but I cant really say right now</li>
            <li> Love it! I researched and read a lot of reviews and it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product on my edges, which are thinning due to weaves and perms. No improvement yet, I&#x27;ll provide another update 5 weeks from now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product as a hair moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been told by many that it promotes hair growth and it keeps natural, kinky, curly hair in perfect shape.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks for me and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It is heavy so a little is all you need. What is amazing about it for me is that it makes my unruly gray hairs lie down and they are less visible.</li>
            <li> I loce this stuff. ..grows my hair and my baby&#x27;s too! Great product!</li>
            <li> Loved it will buy more soon ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> works great on daughters hair</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the cap of the bottle was cracked. The oil wasn&#x27;t spilling out but I can&#x27;t put a tight seal on the bottle.  Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> Great product but the smell is too strong</li>
            <li> one and only oil that works for my gair!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and my hair drinks this stuff like water!  This is definitely one of my staple products for my thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair oily, but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results as of yet</li>
            <li> This was a gift , I have seen growth , in my friends hair for the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
            <li> This will not finish castor oil yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase next 2015-2016&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I show my friends in UK, HK and Australia.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for 2 years Now and I must admit this is a great oil I must keep a bottle of this oil in my home at all times. I would recommend this oil to a friend</li>
            <li> Very good oil for coarse hair. It&#x27;s a heavy oil and the smell is less than desirable. But it&#x27;s a very good oil that locks moisture into your hair, after you&#x27;ve moisturized it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for natural hair usage. It goes on good.  It&#x27;s done great in my hair but sealing and adding shine to it.  It was purchased at a great price and the quality was very good</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I can afford it and it makes my hair grow!! Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have Been using this product on my hair for almost a year ..I love it because it makes my hair grow and its stimulates my hair.. I mix this with garlic organic oil and apply to my hair on a daily basis.. Will always order because it works for me</li>
            <li> I will forever be purchasing this item.  It is a good source of oil and makes my dry hair feel great.  Some individuals indicate it thickens their hair but it doesn&#x27;t work like that for me.  I still love using this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I was truly surprised at the thickness of the oil. I first used the product on my husband lock it gave his locks such shine and lustre giving that his scalp stay&#x27;s dry with other products this is doing him good</li>
            <li> This oil helped my dry scalp</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really moisturizes your hair and thickens it. If you have thin edges rub this castor on your scalp on a regular basis and your hair will grow back!! I would recommend it to anyone trying to thicken hair and of course to the all Natural sistas out there. If it is too thick for your hair texter, you can mix with finer oil like coconut or avocado oil, or just use it as a hot oil treatment......</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for very long, however so far am enjoying the results using it as a scalp massage oil and also as a moisture sealer for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle was so tiny</li>
            <li> Third time ordering, I use this on my hair as well as my two daughters. It have grown all of our hair in a timely matter.... at least an inch a month....results were noticed after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It is great product. When my wife uses it on her hair, her hair shine looks natural. Its odor a little bit undesirable, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  It smells like burnt beans.  I have to be careful to place the oil on my scalp and not on my locks, it the oil is somewhat thick.  I haven&#x27;t used it often enough to note a difference since I don&#x27;t use it too often because of the smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is so rich and thick it deeply seals my hair Have been using this for almost a year and I love how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I love my JBCO!! Keeps my hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She uses it everyday and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oil. My reasons for purchasing were to help grow back my edges, however it wasn&#x27;t the reason for the recovery of my edges. I just took better care of my edges and put them in less tightening styles. I rarely ever use the oil. However I still believe it&#x27;s a good oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Jamaican so I know a good castor oil this is missing something!</li>
            <li> Love this oil, have used on scalp and have noticed thicker hair.  UPDATE:  After using about 2 to 3 times a week for 4 weeks, I noticed thicker hair and the area on my hairline appeared to be filling in with new hair.    I stopped using it because I got busy, but recently started again, and it really is amazing how this stuff works.  I&#x27;ve received comments from my mom and my husband that my hair looks thicker.    Also, I had my mom use on her eyebrows and she had new hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is so miraculous that im switching to this brand for all my hair products....</li>
            <li> Castor oil in general has always been good to me. My hair is prone to dryness. This is my first purchase of black castor oil. Natural hair, I use it on my edges for strenght and on the length of the strands and ends to seal moisture. I purchased this specifically to assist in the regrowth of area thinned out due to clip in extensions and heat application on &amp;#34;leave out&amp;#34; for a style I just had. It has been 2 weeks so far and the oil is used in conjunction with a derma roller also purchased through prime. Although it&#x27;s too late to update on the progress with the stress area, I already love how this makes my hair feel. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have yet to get the desired results, understanding hair growth does takes time! I will say it&#x27;s thick &amp; rich but I&#x27;m NOT fully convinced that this is the REAL &amp;#34;Jamaican BLACK&amp;#34;  DEAL! The label is generic and so non- informative!  Didn&#x27;t care for the customer service interaction I experienced when I called customer service...unengaged, not informational, no salesmanship...  certainly didn&#x27;t sell me on the product or company!  Sorry but I can not recommend this product at this time.</li>
            <li> My edges and eyebrows have been growing back with nightly application. A little goes a long way and you just have to get used to the smell lol &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Have been already using, couldnt find much difference in hair yet but lets see. I am keep using it.</li>
            <li> This works great on everyone&#x27;s hair in my home no more breaking or frizz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been trying this product for about 3 weeks but so far so good ,,, no breakage .  Will continue the journey</li>
            <li> Great product! I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich and nourishing for my hair. I mix it with coconut oil and olive and my hair loves it</li>
            <li> I still love the product in this bottle but...BUT BEWARE OF CHEAP, TACKY, BOTTLE TOP!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff costs too much to have a spinning lid that is barely held in place.  today mine fell to the floor and if it were a more runny oil, my rug would be smelly and ruined.  the bottle is made of thick glass, but flimsy is too strong a word to describe this dang lid.  FIX THIS CHEAP TACKY BOTTLE TOP!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not really noticing a difference but hopeful</li>
            <li> This item made me bald</li>
            <li> Use this on the whole family&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s thick and light.. It works great for a hot oil treatment for hair and great on your skin. I have very dry hair this product allows moisture for a couple days.. I have dry skin, I&#x27;m using as a repair lotion/ moisturizer for my dry damaged skin.. Seen results in two days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t you it my hair feel starved......my go too every time!</li>
            <li> I tried this out on my eyebrows when I first got it to see if it would help them grow and so far, it looks like it really did help some. I&#x27;m not saying I have fur above my eyes but I can see where hair wasn&#x27;t, hair is now. I&#x27;ll continue to use it there and in my head. Just wish it didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I Love the way it make my hair feels. It a wonderful product and I will tell all my family and friends about it.</li>
            <li> I love his product have been using this oil for about two weeks and  I can see the difference with my hair thickening from using this oil! Great product but the smell isn&#x27;t the great.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a bald spot. I think it has helped with regrowth at a steady rate. Not the best smell, but I only use a few times during the week only on the scalp/bald spot. Product is very thick..so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love JBCO! It helps coat my hair and seals my end. Also helps greatly with edges which is where I am currently using it most due to having a baby 3 months ago and just now experiencing the postpartum shedding.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Good product it really helps one of best product will be buying more when my supply is done nice one</li>
            <li> It has not caused any adversed reactions.  It is not extremely harsh even though it has somewhat of a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for not ordering this stuff a lot sooner.  It is as amazing as everyone says. Some complain about the smell and while I&#x27;ll say it isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff, the smell is tolerable and people tend to mix it with a coconut or tea tree oil.  I applied this through my hair the day before I washed it had the best experience with detangling/drying my hair ever.  My hair is long thick and extremely dry so I recommend this (along with a Denman detangling brush) to anyone with similar hair types or trying to grow their hair and reduce breakage/shedding.</li>
            <li> Bought hoping for thick hair, or would probably do that eventually. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s really greasy and sticky, I prefer something lighter like grapeseed oil. That&#x27;s the only reason it got 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and needed...</li>
            <li> Amazing product !!! My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Love this! Along with biotin my hair has stopped falling out so rapidly. I believe this oil healed my dry unhealthy scalp and has helped my hair grow back stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I think it is working and helping to grow in bare spots</li>
            <li> Not sure what this oil is suppose to do but it does nothing for growing your hair edges other than give you oily skin prone to breakouts if you have acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, I definitely saw hair growth and density. I would be sure to get more. It is very thick.</li>
            <li> Love it! Always have, always will.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars cause shipping was quick &amp; it actually works for my hair... seeing alot of thickness &amp; less shedding &amp; it makes your hair sooooo soft... love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!  I tell everyone about it!  After trying so many other things, this oil did exactly what blogs I read about it said it was going to do.  It is a miracle oil.  There&#x27;s nothing like it!</li>
            <li> Noticed thickness in hair since use about 3 months  my lock tech also noticed different without me mention anything about using jbc</li>
            <li> A little thick and has a weird smell but my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much and it grew. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love my black Jamaicastoroil, now I wont live with out it thanks very much</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than expected and perfectly in tact. Plan on buying again</li>
            <li> Just beginning to use product..not sure how to rate at this time!</li>
            <li> I love this castro oil, I use it all over my body even on my face, you will not  regret it .</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have not used the product long enough to give it any other rating. Thus far I have no complaints and it appears that it may suit my purpose very well.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommend to me to help restore hair growth in areas where my hair is thinning. I appreciate the recommendation and I would, and have, recommended the product to others.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order fairly quick and in perfect condition but I gave only a 3 star because I am skeptical about the quality of the product. I purchased this same product from other venders at different times but in a smaller quantity and in both cases they had the exact same smell, consistency,  and color. This product on the other hand smell or oder is off, it is not as strong which makes me think it has possibly been diluted with another oil.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this oil! Love love love! Hair and scalp loves it!</li>
            <li> Always bought this in stores, but saw it on Amazon on sale &amp; decided to save myself money. It comes in a plastic bottle vs the ones I buy at the store that come in a glass bottle. And im not too sure if this is 100% the real thing because the scent is a little off compared to the ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price!</li>
            <li> Nice and thick.  Bad smell, but works.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> its very thick and has a weird smell, I cut it with some almond oil and that helps since I have thin hair, but i must say i love this stuff, when I run out I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of this product so much so I took the bite and ordered, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it just yet.</li>
            <li> Ok black women of America this stuff works wonderfully to help grow your hair back.  I love it, yes it smells a little but it is not a lingering smell, and I no longer have an itchy scalp, love, love love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and it&#x27;s great for keeping it moisturized in between styling.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars  because for some reason this batch I bought smells like serious tobacco. I&#x27;m torn because it works great for twist outs but my hair smells like a chimney. I&#x27;ve bought this in the past - but not experienced this. Beyond that - it does exactly what you expect. It&#x27;s very thick and keeps your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping.  Love jbco!  I use this mainly for my natural hair, and sometimes on my body too.  Helped to thicken and lengthen my hair, and my daughter&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li> I just received my JBC oil yesterday..i used it last night..it&#x27;s really thick when i put it on my scalp but when i rinsed my hair it left it really soft.it left my hair greasy and the smoky smell disappeared but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because of the benefits I&#x27;m hoping to gain ..I have really bad scalp build up that would make my scalp smell bad and it looks like the oil has cleared it up which makes me super happy...and also it looks like it cleared up some acne i had on my forehead and near my hairline..It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will work for my hair growth but i will continue to use it...the shipping was fast and overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far !</li>
            <li> This product is everything! It helps protects your hair and preserves your ends for keeping your hair from breaking. Integral part of my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much, MUCH thicker oil than I expected. It&#x27;s almost like glycerin. It also has an odor that I&#x27;m really not thrilled about at all. It smells like a sushi restaurant in a bottle. That said, my hair LOVES it. The twist out results I&#x27;ve achieved since using this have been night and day. I find that sweet almond oil REALLY cuts the scent.</li>
            <li> jamaican black castor oil is my go to oil. For over a year now I have used this product. I use it because it conditions my hair and scalp. It&#x27;s a great leave in for conditioning the hair. I have tight cocky dry hair! My hair works well with this because it becomes soft and easy to manage. Your hair will smell like an herb. If you don&#x27;t like the smell you can mix it with conditioner. It&#x27;s great for a hot oil treatment . It thickens my thin spot! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast! I&#x27;m ready to try this out for the first time!..I&#x27;ve saw all good reviews on this product!.</li>
            <li> Like it very much!! Added to my 3X@&lt;br /&gt;Week ritual.</li>
            <li> i have used only once since i purchased it but the one time it really did work very good on my shedding hair. but its STINKS!!!!!!!!!! i will have to buy nose plugs to continue using this product but it does the job for your hair. its worth giving it a try! and its cheap!</li>
            <li> OMG what can I say...Absolutely the best My hair is so thick and it is all because of this oil.</li>
            <li> This product works great my hair really benefited from daily use. But after doing some research, I discovered that &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; Castor oil just CONTAINS ASHES FROM THE CASTOR PLANT; Ricinus communis. So While it seems your are getting some rare and exotic product, you really aren&#x27;t getting anything different than regular castor oil; only ashes of a plant have been added with no proof of being any more beneficial than regular castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring this up because, &amp;#34;Jamaican Black Castor Oil&amp;#34; can get pricey- so why spend more money on a product that is truly no different than any other quality castor oil? I would encourage future buyers not to get caught in the hype of Black Castor oil when it&#x27;s doing the same exact thing as regular castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars- I did like the product, but I found no different nor did I find any additional benefit over regular castor oil.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I saw results in 2 weeks. I had just gotten my hair cut two weeks before I started using the oil.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist could not see the cut she had done on my last visit. I waited 4 weeks to return to my stylist by this time I needed a perm again.</li>
            <li> I love it, only problem is it has a very strong smell, not pleasant at all!  Use sparingly on scalp only!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Ive ordered it more than once. It truly helps your edges grow back</li>
            <li> This product is a joke. Do not buy it for your hair. I think those reviews are false</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I started using it instantly and after 1 week I saw my edges growing. I have a low natural hair style and micro braids had taken my edges out. They weren&#x27;t bald, they were very thin but the castor oil immediately started working. It&#x27;s a month and a half later and my edges have grown back completely. I would recommend this oil to anyone who&#x27;s having problems with thin hair or thin edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a mth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any big improvements but I&#x27;m going to give it more time. It does keep my hair moistured . Which is a plus for colored hair.</li>
            <li> great for hair growth. i put  a little on my eyelashes, they are so long and thicker. Not at thick as hair on my legs but pretty nice. My eyelashes still fall out as normal but now i dont have bald spots.</li>
            <li> Please note, this stuff is thick and has a slight burnt/woodsy smell. I think it smells wonderful and when mixed with other oils(avocado, sweet almond....) it goes on smooth. This stuff is amazing for your scalp and, along with some essential oils, helped get rid of annoying dandruff and helped my husband thicken his hairline. Now for this, consistency is key and its not an overnight process. But it works! I bought a bottle for a friend to help with her eczema and she absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing and helps with split ends, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it really works</li>
            <li> it works very well on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> My hair broken off very bad, I could see my scalp.  I read the reviews and I read good and bad reviews.  However, after my personal use, I only have AWESOME things to report.  My hair grew back and I LOVE the JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL.  I have purchased another bottle since my first use and gifted my hair dresser a bottle as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my curly-textured hair after shampoo.  It helps to remove the tangles w/o breakage and keeps the fragile ends moisturized.  A small amount around the edges of my hair does the same.  Helps to re-grow your lashes and brows ...again I believe it is the humectant factor of castor oil that is beneficial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick. Didn&#x27;t expect it to smell so bad but that&#x27;s how I knew it was 100% natural. I don&#x27;t notice a MAJOR improvement but I know it needs time to work.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time the only had thing is it made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> This is one of my foundation oils. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;get busy oil&amp;#34;. As it&#x27;s very thick with a dark roasted aroma.., mix it with other oils. Its voodoo in a bottle because your hair will grow thicker, longer and stronger. Alittle goes a long way and your hair will retain moisture for three to four days.**Important this is not a oil to use alone it must be paired with a lighter oil. Excellent for us 4 ladies.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my edges are coming back</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not fond of the smell, the JBCO is working and has helped to keep my hair moisturized. I decided to try it on my skin by mixing it with a little skin cream and EVOO and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming ashy.</li>
            <li> Works amazing but smells really weird</li>
            <li> Love this product is working as expected</li>
            <li> its good, seems all natural. So far my hair has not really changed/improved but i like this product.It was really moisturizing so time will tell. Has a strong smell, but that comes with being natural</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> smells good, i have to get in the habit of using it more. i&#x27;ve been putting it in my hair also. i&#x27;ve herd it works great. Ill come back and review more if it works. I used it on my eyebrows for 30 days and the results were awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. Been using it once a week for the last month as a hot oil treatment. I was skeptical at first but I was willing to give it a try. I had a tumer on my adrenal gland that was throwing my hormones into overdrive. One drastic change was my hair thinning at an alarming rate and growing back at a snails pace if at all in some places. Even after it was removed I got nothing.  This product I must say is changing that. Bold spots are filling in and I&#x27;m getting new growth I can actually see. I&#x27;m a fan for life now. Smell is a bit strong but I add in a few drops of peppermint oil and that solves the problem.</li>
            <li> I like it Jamaican castor oil helps my hair growth... Very excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product because I had a bs weave job. It took out my edges , so I needed something to grow them back. So I massaged the oil on my edges faithfully every night and it worked.. The only con is that it is a heavy oil and it weighs down my  hair. Skip the oil if trying to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Kind of thick but mixes well with other oils. Looks and feels great on my hair and gives it shine.</li>
            <li> Smell is not that bad I&#x27;ve never used this oil before so idk people are skeptical about if it&#x27;s the real deal. Very thick does NOT seem watered down and received it quick,</li>
            <li> This oil I&#x27;d great for natural black hair. It adds great moisture and definitely promotes growth. Great for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> THIS ALWAYS LIVES UPT O EXPECTATIONS I LOVE I T</li>
            <li> good price for the product. Excellent delivery time</li>
            <li> appears to be the authentic Jamaican black castor oil seond time purchasing does have  strong wood scent some compare to tobacco I don&#x27;t think so though moisturizing for hair an skin thick consistency</li>
            <li> Love this product...quality, packaging etc! The smell is a bit weird, but that&#x27;s how it smells in general, and it also fades.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> good for edges..shipment came in quick..</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughters hair was ripped from her scalp last month . hoping this products at least helps. Doctor tell me not to worry but a whole scalp braid was pulled and its been a month and no peach fuzz :( . high  hopes for this product. It came ON TIME BTW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found a decently priced vendor for this product. I have been going without this product for over a year just because now that it has become popular the price has seemed to skyrocket, and the availability is still to scarce. I use this product on my hair to lock in moisture, and it&#x27;s an important of my hair regime.</li>
            <li> The aroma is a bit strong. Not sure I like the smoky smell. It is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Great product, thick and yellow in color like true black caster oil.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;ve seen and felt a difference in my hair when it comes to thickness but other than that nothing else really. It is extremely oily </li>
            <li> This is really like a miracle oil.  I use it on every ache and pain that I have, as well as my scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing.  I looked at it to try and find a product that would make my mom&#x27;s super thin hair thicker.  She put it on her scalp every night for about two months and, wow, what a difference,  She no longer needs to wear her wig.  I&#x27;m married so putting it on every night would not work for me, but I do put it on my scalp and all through my dry hair about an hour before I wash it.  My hair soaks it in so much that it is almost dry in that hour.  My hair is looking great - shiny and healthy.  I have been using it combined with coconut oil on my face and the results are terrific.  People complement me on my skin all the time and their mouths just drop open when I tell them I&#x27;m 51.  They usually guess 38.  If I happen to only mention that I have been married for 30 years, they get a funny look on their face and ask how old was I when I got married.  It&#x27;s so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry, flaky feet and nothing has helped.  I&#x27;ve tried everything. I file my feet briefly and mix a few drops of this oil in my cocoa butter gel, rub on my feet and then put on two footies or socks.  It is really oily and will soak through one pair.  I have sandal ready feet in about an hour.  I rub the extra oil on my knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smoky odor at first, but I don&#x27;t even notice it now.  My husband has never said anything about a funny smell.  I use it all the time and this bottle has lasted for many months.  I pour some into a smaller squeeze bottle and only a few drops are needed.  Look online for a ton of other beauty uses.</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li> Stops my pimples and helps grow my hair. Love it. Only thing is its thick af.</li>
            <li> I never tried it before. I was looking at a video on YouTube. My sides are thin. I am all natural. The price was right. My hair is growing now.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to used the leave-in conditioner and detangler yet, but the other products are very good. will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Great product, my edges are thicker than before .</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and it met my expectations. Definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Product is great, time frame for shipping was quick</li>
            <li> this product is great, it moisturizes and growth the hair.  customer service was great and I received the product in a timely manner</li>
            <li> It always meet my needs. Love what it does for my hair</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Quality product</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It leaves my hair very soft and my curls last a long time.  It helps minimize the frizz.  I add other oils to blend in with the fragrance, which is not horrible, but not the most pleasant.  My daughter was having some hair loss and within a month, I have seen a noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> YES GROWING MY HAIR PREFECT.</li>
            <li> 8oz for ten bucks! i jumped at the deal. i use castor oil in my hot oil treatments for my hair and it is amazing! the oil is really thick and it is easy to have a heavy hand but i find that warming it a little helps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my eyebrows and eyelashes for months trying every product but this really works!! It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and I&#x27;m seeing such a difference. But it is thick and smelly. I tried using it on my hair... My hair was SO sticky for a week, I&#x27;d recommend mixing coconut oil with just a drop of castor oil...</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel. I do prefer using it alone and not with other products. I find it more useful when I apply it to sections rather than rubbing in hands and spreading it over my head. It is definitely something I will use again.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a distinct smell, is thick and a little sticky---but I like it.</li>
            <li> I love the jbco very good for natural hair and I have noticed growth since applying to my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product I actually think it thickened my hair !</li>
            <li> Very thick so go light, so may need to mix with a lighter oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchase a hair care set to fix some hair loss for approximately $180 &amp; it worked a little within a two month time spend. Then I&#x27;d purchase the Jamaican Black Castor Oil &amp; it worked so much better had improvement within two weeks &amp; only for $9.</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering jbco from this company. My order arrived in a plastic bottle instead of glass like my previous orders. The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong and the consistency as thick either. I was skeptical at 1st about the differences but it&#x27;s just an effective. I use it on my hair, face, abd skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they put in this stuff but I began to see immediate results (after trying everything) to regrow my&lt;br /&gt;edges. I have also used it on my husband and son&#x27;s small bald spot with immediate results as well. It smells like a burnt wood (to me) but it quickly dissipates. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. I tried it as a hot oil hair treatment. The smell is too much and it didn&#x27;t wash easy from my hair. I&#x27;m Caucasian and have fine hair. It isn&#x27;t for me. I only used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Great Price for a GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY RESULTS SO FAR. Highly recommended! SMELL of the product is so so but not BAD</li>
            <li> Bought this to make my hair elixer mixed with sulfur. Have not used it long emough to rate. I will update once I have some results. The smell is ok as well. (not great...just ok)</li>
            <li> If used consistently it does help with hair growth smells terrible though so keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> Mixed with shea butter works for growth of edges.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like authentic JBCO. hmmmmm I&#x27;ll continue use and update later. It just seems thinner than normal</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Moisturises hair and scalp very well. Helps strengthen and grow hair. Definitely will buy again..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the oil to be as thick as it is, nor was I expecting it to smell like it does - it&#x27;s not an unbearable smell, it&#x27;s just not particularly attractive. I&#x27;ll update the review when I start to see healthier edges.</li>
            <li> I have used this product  before. I use it moisturize my locs...it does the job for me. I only use a small amount, so the bottle last awhile.</li>
            <li> Recommend to friends with stiffness in the joints &amp; sore muscles. This why I purchased this it works fast.</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair. Just get it and apply it to your scalp twice a week, in the early part of the day (so you don&#x27;t leave a majority of the oil on your pillow).</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a nice shine</li>
            <li> On my second bottle. Definitely replaced Argan oil!</li>
            <li> Fabulous for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I use this for my edges. Great stuff and results are real.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong but like it so far for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love this s***! Good for edges. A little goes a long way so enjoy your restoration.</li>
            <li> Only use on wet hair for the best results! I retained a full inch in 20 days of use! Perfect for sealing moisture and growing lovely locks!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today I can&#x27;t wait to start using this while my natural hair is in protective style &#x3D;D can&#x27;t wait to see my edges start growing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!*,*</li>
            <li> I ordered my bottle of JBCO on 4/15 and received it today! (4/18) I&#x27;m so happy how fast it came. The oil is thick and it does have a smell but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected. I hope I see results like everyone else!</li>
            <li> Working fine for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I  ordered this product.  Someone suggested that I try it so I  did.  Having had a serious dry, itchy scalp from childhood, I  was desperate for relief.  This product  has relieved the itch tremendously, but is very greasy.  However,  because  I see results, I will  continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried doing a 90 day challenge using this stuff. I only made it about 45 days, but my hair grew a little more than an inch. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Been using since I got my hands on it for my.natural hair over 4 Years ago all I can.say is it&#x27;s a stable 4 life!!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! This is one out of three products I use for the healthy of my hair. A little surely goes a long way. I purchased this In May and I have half a bottle now that it is the end of August. This oil is awesome for growth and maintaining length, manageability, and health. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product but has a slight scent to it</li>
            <li> Been using this for several weeks and have not noticed any change - thinish hairline. Hope the results will change soon :-(  So far its been disappointing.</li>
            <li> Definitely a staple products for all naturals!!!!! The price is amazing will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my natural hair the oil is very thick like a cooking oil, it has a burnt ash smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Great for sealing in the moisture.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way for this product, so please don&#x27;t be heavy handed or you&#x27;ll end up washing your hair because is so caked of oil.  I like it a lot, it seals my ends and gives my hair a shine, and it last a long time.  I noticed for me, when using too much of this product, i developed a massive headache, so that why I indicated that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my girl, she uses it on her natural hair so she keeps buying it so I guess it&#x27;s doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This product does work. I have been using this product since 3/14. I am a five year breast cancer survivor, this accounts for my hair loss. I had thick shoulder length hair. Your hair changes after chemo, the texture as well as appearance.  My hair grew back, not as thick and minus hair in the crown and my front hair line.  A small portion of cancer survivors do experience  permanent hair loss which I found out after the fact. Also I can&#x27;t use perm chemicals in my hair or I&#x27;ll lose what I have left. So I&#x27;ve been wearing  braids and pinning  them over the thin spots.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been oiling my scalp with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and that&#x27;s all. Then I do an intense conditioning once a month with full strength coconut oil. I apply the coconut oil to my hair and scalp then cover it with a plastic bag for about and hour and rinse out. I&#x27;ve notice my hair feels moist and a lot softer to the touch now.  The Chemo drugs after effects had left my hair dry and feeling like straw. I&#x27;ve  notice that my front hair line is starting to fill in.  The crown area where there was no hair  now has peach fuzz. The rest of my hair is beginning to thicken up some. Because of the way I lost my hair, this product could be working a little slower for me. Other reviews said you could expect good hair growth in  about four months. However, I certainly will continue to use this product. This is the best results I&#x27;ve seen in five years!!!</li>
            <li> I order this product back on March of this year,I reordered again last week.the first time in march I  was 100%  satisfied with the product!I was amazed at the quality and the product it self. This time around I feel complete disappointment.the bottle was a cheap plastic container,the oil extremely runny ,(the consistency of olive oil) and barely any of the common castor oil smell. Never again I will order from these ppl again! No wonder is on sale!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a hair treatment and my god, it made my scalp itch like crazy. It was almost unbearable and I even mixed it with coconut oil. I am scared to use it again so it&#x27;s sitting in my cabinet</li>
            <li> Must have for natural hair!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.I had heard so many great comments about this item. I used it everyday and applied them to my eyebrows at night and let it sit there. I would remove the oil off my eyebrows in the morning. I did this for about a month and saw no difference what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because of the smell, I mean it&#x27;s very conditioning and thick leaves hair shiney and moisturized, but I cannot tolerate the smell, and I don&#x27;t my hair smelling like it.  It&#x27;s kina hard to describe the smell....it&#x27;s like unprocessed wheat (and I don&#x27;t know what that smells like) but I&#x27;m assuming it would smell like Jamacian Black Castor Oil.  It&#x27;s a good product, if you can get passed the smell.</li>
            <li> My mother has used castor oil for years but she doesn&#x27;t live close by for me to get it from her. This smells and feels just the same.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I have notice some thickness and growth.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It really locks in the moisture for my kinky curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does have a smell, but it is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for hair care and skin care.</li>
            <li> since i started using this, my hair became ticker. i don&#x27;t mind the scent it goes away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Bought to grow my shoulder length hair longer and it not only has grown a couple inches in a month, my hair is now incredibly soft!! I am 23 and of Native American decent and I&#x27;ve dyed my hair more times than I can count. This virtually erased all damage. I am super happy with my results. The only down side is the smell... I literally hate the smell ðŸ˜« it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with breakage so far... initially smells, but amazingly goes away after application.!!</li>
            <li> Did a good job really enjoyed the product</li>
            <li> This product seems to be real castor oil.</li>
            <li> Love it!! You have to a faithful user and you will see results.</li>
            <li> Yes this help your hair grow. I purchase this my 4th time , I always get the 8oz but now they starting to make it look 4oz instead of 8oz. I would purchase it from somebody else cause thats a damn scam. Save your change</li>
            <li> Using it for a month. Seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> Great product and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing! will definitely purchase product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil! It has definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss that I&#x27;ve been experiencing since I was 17 years old. I used to lose a heartbreaking amount of hair daily... now it&#x27;s reduced to a couple of strands throughout the day.  I used to have thick, silky, beautiful, long hair which has drastically fallen out over the years...  I loved the reviews I read before purchasing the product and now agree that this is a heaven send... I am eager to see more positive changes over continuous use. I currently oil/massage my scalp once every 2 or 3 days. I am of East Indian descent.  I also use the Pura d&#x27;or line of shampoo and conditioner for hair loss. They&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth the price to stop hair loss and hopefully regrow my God given tresses.  Ps, The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is bc the oil does break out my sensitive skin. My face has broken out quite terribly, but it&#x27;s been so good for my scalp, that I don&#x27;t want to stop using it. I&#x27;ve begun sleeping with a shower cap the nights I massage this oil into my scalp. Hopefully this will prevent any future breakouts.</li>
            <li> I recieved my product very early.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair soft &amp; hydrated. I even use out on my face &amp; it has cleared up.</li>
            <li> The BEST Castor Oil on the market.</li>
            <li> Love it and definitely worth the price. I received really fast.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice</li>
            <li> I love it already thank you!!</li>
            <li> yes I will continue to use this product its a go to of mine because I use it for multiple things</li>
            <li> Always a good product I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It took a month to get here but I love this product</li>
            <li> love this product and it has really help my hair, I have all my friend use it.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin love it. I don&#x27;t use it for my scalp just the ends of my 4c hair to seal in the moisture. My scalp doesn&#x27;t like JBCO for some reason which is depressing. But the rest of my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see the result it brings. I always use castor oil just not thus one so...</li>
            <li> Love it , wish it came in a bigger bottle . Helps my hair grow fast . My husband uses this instead of gel because it&#x27;s so thick . His hair grew faster then mines. He has thick curly hair. Either was for all hair types. You may have to just add to ends for straighter hair.</li>
            <li> Started using it. My hair is growing. I have using it for the last 3&lt;br /&gt;weeks!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , I use it everyday to keep my hair most and shinny</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin and makes your hair soft</li>
            <li> I used the Jamaican black castor oil in my mixture when I created my own shea butter and coconut oil moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, but it&#x27;s great for your hair, it&#x27;s a healing oil, etc. My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, so it helps moisturize her scalp and minimizes dandruff. We use it as needed in an applicator bottle. It makes her hair happy and was also packaged properly. I will probably purchase from this seller again. Make your own hair care products that contain Jamaican black castor oil and save money! Watch my tutorial. DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li> It would be helpful to have a dropper or top with a smaller opening to pour small amounts on to your scalp or skin without spilling it. Also, it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how much to use or how often.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8 oz was packaged appropriately for it&#x27;s size. This oil is used as a collaboration of products for my natural hair. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps in the sheen and  sealing of my hair. It is also used in collaboration with six other oils &amp; an essence to provide a wonderful product used on my skin- all over. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a product that helps my skin feel soft and seals in hydration (I mist my face first, then apply).</li>
            <li> It arrived a day late but it&#x27;s great for my hair. It&#x27;s growing :)</li>
            <li> This helped my hair and my edges grow back. It really works. I have course hair and using neutrogena leave-in triple moisturizer along with extra virgin coconut oil helps keep my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product I will definitely purchase again very happy!</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned out from this product line.</li>
