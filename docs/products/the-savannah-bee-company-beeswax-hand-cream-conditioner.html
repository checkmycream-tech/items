            <li> I flirted with buying this hand cream for months, but I finally caved when winter weather attacked my hands. I&#x27;m a very busy mom of infant twins, so I wash my hands a billion times a day (true fact!). This hand cream heals and protects my skin like no other. I found it for several dollars less at my local Whole Foods, but it may have been on sale. I would buy it at the list price if needed, though. Even if it didn&#x27;t soothe and heal my chapped hands, I would probably buy it because of vanity. This stuff makes my hands look 15 years younger! it also smells great and does not include soy - a huge plus for someone who has a contact allergy to soy. (It does contain tree nut oils, though, so avoid if that&#x27;s an issue for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my jar on top of my desk where I can apply it each evening before I start writing. True Fact #2: I have killed off 200% fewer characters since I started using this hand cream. It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should probably go ahead and buy this little jar of magic.</li>

            <li> My husband has a weird skin condition that causes his hands to blister and peel. None of his doctors have ever been able to diagnose the condition other to say it&#x27;s an immune response. After years of trial and error, we found the Savannah Bee hand cream and it works miracles on his hands! It&#x27;s not too greasy and keeps his hands moist and keeps them from peeling. yay!</li>

            <li> Terrific hand cream.  I used to swear by Burt&#x27;s Bees, but didn&#x27;t like the greasiness.  This absorbs much more quickly and isn&#x27;t too greasy to begin with.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite hand cream.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me for my dried out hands.  After first application my hands healed quickly.  I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Love this product. Will keep buyin again and again. Price is competitive with the store.</li>
            <li> This hand cream did the trick, but I couldn&#x27;t really take the scent. Even wearing gloves at bedtime, the smell got to me. It is good and greaseless if you don&#x27;t mind the scent. I am just sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> smooths  hands and smells great too.  !!!!!!!!! Love it</li>
            <li> This hand cream is a keeper.  It&#x27;s the consistency of whipped cream and it&#x27;s cool and soothing when you put it on.  It&#x27;s very hard for me to not have my fingers turn into bloody pulps in winter, but this really helps and it makes me feel a bit more human in February.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
