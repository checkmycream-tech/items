            <li>This scent smells fresh, clean and light..</li>
            <li>So girly and sweet.</li>
            <li>Judging from all the reviews I really think I will love it.</li>
            <li>Love this so much</li>
            <li>A sweet smell</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, and not too smelly.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>I love that it came so fast and had a gift included.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering or sweet the way one may expect.</li>
            <li>When I was asked to try this product, I quickly accepted.  </li>
            <li>This one has just the right amount of sweet</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; the bottle, plus it arrived early!</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my daughter, smells very nice - not overwhelming or cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s got the whole collection now thanks to amazon and their great low prices</li>
            <li>It is light and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s just ok (for an adult).</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance so far.</li>
            <li>But this is BY FAR my favorite</li>
            <li>more mature smelling, it just smells</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price too &amp;amp</li>
            <li>She bought it for a relative as a Christmas gift and mentioned she really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>She was surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li>but I have loved the other perfumes from Biebers name and I took a leap of faith.</li>
            <li>but yet it has the right amount of sweetness in it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a cheap spray perfume for young girls.  </li>
            <li>Pretty smell</li>
            <li>arrived fast!</li>
            <li>This is definitely where I&#x27;ll be purchasing my favorite perfume from now on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so pretty.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas present for my niece and they love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar, but I found Someday to be sickly sweet and Girlfriend to be too sweet and floral.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my Daughter and when she open it she love it so much thanks just like the pic</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with his previous two fragrances, Someday and Girlfriend, think of this as a more mature edition to the two.  </li>
            <li>I  really didn&#x27;t want my money going into his pockets but the smell is irresistible</li>
            <li>And arrived fast</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li>Anything that is Bieber, she wants.</li>
            <li>One of my other favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of it and it smells just as good as any of my more expensive fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Even when i do like the smell of girlfriend and someday a little more</li>
            <li>brand new in the box sealed</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My 15 year old Justin Bieber fan loves it!</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised that Justin Bieber has a new perfume out for women.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t clash with his natural scent.</li>
            <li>I love the base notes as they add a warm feeling to the fruit and florals mixed in.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not a sweet smell like his other fragrances, very light &amp;amp;</li>
            <li>Next I was shopping and saw there was a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old, and yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume almost daily!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this product again in the near future.</li>

            <li> I love the smell &amp; the bottle, plus it arrived early!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter, smells very nice - not overwhelming or cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s got the whole collection now thanks to amazon and their great low prices</li>
            <li> It is light and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s just ok (for an adult).</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance so far.</li>
            <li> But this is BY FAR my favorite</li>
            <li> more mature smelling, it just smells</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price too &amp;amp</li>
            <li> She bought it for a relative as a Christmas gift and mentioned she really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> She was surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li> but I have loved the other perfumes from Biebers name and I took a leap of faith.</li>
            <li> but yet it has the right amount of sweetness in it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a cheap spray perfume for young girls.  </li>
            <li> Pretty smell</li>
            <li> arrived fast!</li>
            <li> This is definitely where I&#x27;ll be purchasing my favorite perfume from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my niece and they love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar, but I found Someday to be sickly sweet and Girlfriend to be too sweet and floral.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my Daughter and when she open it she love it so much thanks just like the pic</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with his previous two fragrances, Someday and Girlfriend, think of this as a more mature edition to the two.  </li>
            <li> I  really didn&#x27;t want my money going into his pockets but the smell is irresistible</li>
            <li> And arrived fast</li>
            <li> she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li> Anything that is Bieber, she wants.</li>
            <li> One of my other favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of it and it smells just as good as any of my more expensive fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Even when i do like the smell of girlfriend and someday a little more</li>
            <li> brand new in the box sealed</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old Justin Bieber fan loves it!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that Justin Bieber has a new perfume out for women.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t clash with his natural scent.</li>
            <li> I love the base notes as they add a warm feeling to the fruit and florals mixed in.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a sweet smell like his other fragrances, very light &amp;amp;</li>
            <li> Next I was shopping and saw there was a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, and yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume almost daily!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> It definitely last all day but not sure what to do with so much perfume.</li>
            <li> The fragrance stays for long time.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely different than the other 2</li>
            <li> I like it because it already has a \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> Not really a Justin Bieber fan</li>
            <li> Justin Biebers other perfumes which we did not like at all.</li>
            <li> It a little fruity musky, initially smelled a little fresher.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but hate justin bieber 😂</li>
            <li> have worn it everyday since I received it and have had a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> I feel the scent disappears in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say about it</li>
            <li> , kinda stupid actually.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover up the smell of my dog after he swims in the canal behind my house.</li>
            <li> given there was really bad weather.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t smell too bad!</li>
            <li> Guess all the 5 star is from his fans very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell but hate justin bieber 😂 took me a month to actually purchase this cause I  really didn&#x27;t want my money going into his pockets but the smell is irresistible</li>
            <li> I do love this sent, I can wear it day or night and it smells great on on me! I will definitely purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice... Like floral n grapes..</li>
            <li> Good size, smells great, and had my daughter super happy!!</li>
            <li> One of my other favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this perfume.  This is my second purchase of it and it smells just as good as any of my more expensive fragrances.  I&#x27;m 22 years old, and yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume almost daily!  It IS Justin Bieber, but whether you&#x27;re a fan or not, that shouldn&#x27;t deter you from trying this fragrance.  If you&#x27;re familiar with his previous two fragrances, Someday and Girlfriend, think of this as a more mature edition to the two.  It&#x27;s very similar, but I found Someday to be sickly sweet and Girlfriend to be too sweet and floral.  This one has just the right amount of sweet and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a cheap spray perfume for young girls.  I get compliments on it all the time and I love to pair it with my Paris Amore body lotion from Bath and Body Works.  if you&#x27;re a Paris Amore fan, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> it was the perfect gift for the person I got it for.  They love Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good. So girly and sweet. I think it is going to be great for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Smells good and was cheap</li>
            <li> My Neice loved it. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover up the smell of my dog after he swims in the canal behind my house. I like it because it already has a \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; kind of smell so it doesn&#x27;t clash with his natural scent.</li>
            <li> I have not put 5 stars yet, beause I have not recieved the product. Judging from all the reviews I really think I will love it. I love sweet feminine scents and I ordered this for myself. My friend from US told me this perfume is perfect if you&#x27;re into scents like Dior Addict Summer 2 and Nina Ricci L&#x27;elexir. I have bothe and thought this would be perfect addition to my sweet perfum collection. I&#x27;ll raise feedback to 5 stars if I love the scent after I receive it &lt;3</li>
            <li> DUDE!!! I&#x27;ve had every last Justin Bieber perfume and this one topped it... It put the icing on my Justin Bieber cake! I LOVE IT! I recommend this for anyone and everyone. Wife, mom, girlfriend, fiancé, sister, cousin, aunt, grandmother, or niece. It&#x27;s perfect. Once again, Justin Bieber has done an amazing job</li>
            <li> Love this so much It is his best perfume to date and I am a big fan of Someday and Girlfriend&lt;br /&gt;This is just that much better, and the great thing about it is that it lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it everyday since I received it and have had a lot of compliments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister, comes beautifully packaged, nice gold key as well......more importantly smells great and she loved it !!!</li>
            <li> I was just extremely happy it got to my house on time, given there was really bad weather. The perfume smells great! My girlfriend loves it! she&#x27;s got the whole collection now thanks to amazon and their great low prices</li>
            <li> Really a good smelling perfume. And arrived fast</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume. We tested it in Wal Mart but it was a much better buy&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon. This is a huge bottle and the scent is very pleasant. Not as strong as some&lt;br /&gt;of Justin Biebers other perfumes which we did not like at all. This also comes with a removable&lt;br /&gt;key.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell of this product. It definitely last all day but not sure what to do with so much perfume. Guess all the 5 star is from his fans very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved everything perfect, the fragrance is divine</li>
            <li> Smells nice, bought it for my fiance. Not much more to say about it but apparently more words are required for a review.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 12 year birthday - what can I say...she absolutely loves it and I have to admit, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad!</li>
            <li> LOVE this clean, light scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted for my 12 year old daughter, a good gift although in the coming EnBase is great and surprising, if the perfume is according to that seen in the image</li>
            <li> This was a gift. My daughter loves this perfume! Couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love this smell. My BF loves it also!</li>
            <li> Even when i do like the smell of girlfriend and someday a little more, this&#x27;s still perfect. A sweet smell and I just love the form of the box and the bottle of the parfum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Justin Bieber, but this perfume smells amazing. I smelled it once and loved it, but I was tempted not to get it because I would be supported Biebs. But it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This will make the young girl happy who had on her wish list.  Pretty smell - I tried it to see that it sprayed and loved the smell...</li>
            <li> Was nervous about buying this for my wife, do to the attached name (Justin Bieber), but the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> CHRISTMAS PRESENT - IT IS WHAT SHE WANTED BUT AFTER CHRISTMAS WOULD BE A BETTER TIME TO RATE IT.  I CAN&#x27;T RATE IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT YET OPENED.</li>
            <li> nice product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Came packaged very securely!  No damage!  This was a gift and it was loved!!  Thank you for making her birthday perfect!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my Grand daughter. She loved it. There is just nothing like Justin in a teenage girls life.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.  She is a big fan of Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li> Words can not describe how much I love this perfume! Arrived within 2 days all packed! Best perfume ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it smells great but it never came</li>
            <li> Its discusting....hated eveything bout it....yuk! Yuk! Yuk!.....WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMEND TO IT TO MY DOG.....someday and girlfriend are way better....jus sayin</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got a sample a really liked it. I&#x27;m not a Bieber fan by any means. I just liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the bottle arrived, I noticed it didn&#x27;t really smell as good as the sample I received. It seemed &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;. But hey, what can you expect for a perfume aimed at 15 year olds. They&#x27;re not looking for Chanel, they just want to smell pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s just ok (for an adult). Light, fresh, and not too smelly.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that Justin Bieber has a new perfume out for women. When I was asked to try this product, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent.  It is light and gentle on my skin. It smells floral and fruity without being overbearing to anyone around me. I can smell it and that’s all that matters. I love the fragrance so far. I love wearing fragrance and I am so thrilled to add this one to my collection. The fragrance is strong and long lasting. I love the base notes as they add a warm feeling to the fruit and florals mixed in.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, if you or you child love justin bieber, I would highly recommend!</li>

            <li> My daughter is a big Bieber fan. Anything that is Bieber, she wants. Her bedroom walls are covered in posters. For me, I hope this obsessiom ends soon (ha ha).</li>

Definitely not a sweet smell like his other fragrances, very light &amp;amp; more mature smelling, it just smells wonderful lol! Definitely worth the price too &amp;amp; the bottle is super classy &amp;amp; beautiful! Awesome!!!</li>
