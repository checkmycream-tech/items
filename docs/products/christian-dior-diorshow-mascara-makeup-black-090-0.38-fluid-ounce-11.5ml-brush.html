            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I recommend you buy it and be sure you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>The Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara is a much better product that you can pick up in the drug store for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, Covergirl beats this product.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.    </li>
            <li>I feel confident reapplying Diorshow after it has dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>Hello!Don&#x27;t like Mascara,pay more for this product,hi it&#x27;s not good:(((((((((((((((((I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many kinds of mascara, for more than 40 years.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>super sexy and smoldering!</li>
            <li>Loreal in the gold tube is more impressive and costs significantly less.  </li>
            <li>but it was true!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara delivered right to my door !</li>
            <li>You can also quickly apply more to the ends of your lashes before it dries to create length.  </li>
            <li>I am always reading in Women&#x27;s magazines about some cheap mascara you buy in the drug store that every girl loves.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very well, nice color and coverage, and I&#x27;ve seen some comments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I prefer those which are cruelty free ( not tested on animals )</li>
            <li>No clumps but also no extreme length or volume but nonetheless a good mascara.</li>
            <li>The hearty brush encapsulates the eyelashes, coating them with rich color.</li>
            <li>It has a nice brush that coats my lashes evenly and gives it a nice dark look.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister; this is her absolute favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Lucky to have found this mascara - I have to wear Non Waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>I have pretty light eye lashes</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara....goes on perfectly smooth and made my lashed nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I read reviews where clumping was a problem and would just suggest having an old cleaned mascara wand or spoolie (target) to go over the lashes real quick after application and it takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li>but it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Although it is a bit pricey, it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>also, this mascara is good for use night and with darker shadows/liners where lashes might be less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll apply a few more layers of Diorshow on top of my day-old mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight eyelashes, so I use an eyelash curler and apply Diorshow after curling.</li>
            <li>The Diorshow seemed to take a lot more coats to get my lashes looking big</li>
            <li>I will definitely check it out in the store, but wouldn&#x27;t buy though website again for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more can be said about mascara except that it&#x27;s as necessary as breathing.</li>
            <li>this price, mascara should last much longer and behave much better.</li>
            <li>Mascaras for volumizing seem to be dry and clumpy with more layers applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually love this product, but from this seller my mascara was dry like it had been sitting on a shelf for four years.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about mascara products.  </li>
            <li>It certainly did not blow my mind.</li>
            <li>It plumps up my fine, almost invisible blonde lashes so well that I have eyes again!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the smell;( It smells like a cheap perfume-</li>
            <li>Delivery fast.</li>
            <li>I need a mascara that is going to really pump up the volume and</li>
            <li>I paid $30 for this thing and I am absolutely BUMMED.</li>
            <li>I really should have returned it because I can&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes by the end of a long day I just want to freshen up my eyes with more concealer without completely redoing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicer than most that I&#x27;ve tried, but if you want lashes with impact for half the price, I suggest Voluminous by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used this mascara before, I was really pleased to find it on Amazon at almost $10 less than the department store, plus I didn&#x27;t have to go the mall to go to the department store.  </li>
            <li>and I have never found a mascara that is better for my sparse and short asian lashes.</li>
            <li>The only possible drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last very many weeks.</li>
            <li>This ranks high on the list.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara before after it was recommend to me while at a makeup counter in a high end store.  </li>
            <li>wand is pretty near perfect; the only quibble I have is that you need to go slow and be careful in the corners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already used it ITS TOTALT FAKE PRODUCT I dont know who wrote that great reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my job and switched to Maybelline Full &amp; Soft for a short time.</li>
            <li>love this product but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes nice &amp; thick</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and the price on here far beats Sephora!</li>
            <li>and then I know it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the best mascaras because it actually gives you crazy volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I was expecting to try it and say \\&quot;wow!</li>
            <li>That is as long as the mascara is fresh.</li>
            <li>First off, the brush is way too big.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Christian Dior (don&#x27;t get me wrong, they make the best eyeshadow) but this mascara just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with the Loreal \\&quot;ball\\&quot; mascara (black and red tube).</li>
            <li>It builds up lashes without clumping, and looks somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>I also like that it completely washes off.  </li>
            <li>I was using  another product that didn&#x27;t always completely wash off, despite not being waterproof at all.  </li>
            <li>no where near the competition.</li>
            <li>Old-</li>
            <li>Luckily the mascara clumped less after a while and the scent went away, so now I quite like the mascara.</li>
            <li>Upon the first use I realized the mascara is very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Like everyone has said...it lifts, and thickens like no other.  </li>
            <li>I have strawberry blond hair and barely there lashes.   </li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly and without clumping, but it does not make your lashes particularly thick or longer.</li>
            <li>I have loved this mascara for a long time and was skeptical on the price</li>
            <li>it gives you a much more dramatic \\&quot;evening\\&quot; look when you do.  </li>
            <li>I have average lashes, not too long or full, so I just need a little something to make them really pop.</li>
            <li>This is really the black lace dress for the eyes....</li>
            <li>mascara was dry and clumpy. seemed old.</li>

            <li> If you cry, get wet, have allergies WATCH OUT</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it, and it wasn&#x27;t worthless, just not as good as Voluminous and terribly over-hyped.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this Mascara is supposed to be that dry</li>

            <li> Makes lashes long and thick without clumps.</li>
            <li> All the diorshow mascaras have a big and thick brush and catches all the small eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When I do this is clumps just a little bit, but</li>
            <li> I have to apply upwards of 8-10 layers of Maybelline to get the everyday effect that I want.</li>

            <li> I never keep track of that date, but I find that after a few months ALL mascaras start to flake into my eyes</li>
            <li> While heavily coating my eyelashes, this Dior product does not clump them together.  </li>
            <li> It thickens, goes on as dry as a mascara can and still work, and it doesn&#x27;t flake, at least not until it&#x27;s past</li>
            <li> Other mascaras are completely useless to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li> I have long brown eyelashes, but they don&#x27;t look very thick.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I really wanted to like this but for the name behind it and the cost, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I waited anxiously all week for this to arrive.</li>
            <li> If you go past the three month mark or you pump air into the container, then it starts to get too thick</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is OKAY. It certainly did not blow my mind. It&#x27;s nicer than most that I&#x27;ve tried, but if you want lashes with impact for half the price, I suggest Voluminous by L&#x27;Oreal. The Diorshow seemed to take a lot more coats to get my lashes looking big and I noticed that it did flake off onto my cheeks throughout the day. It didn&#x27;t get clumpy which is quite nice. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting to try it and say \\&quot;wow! I&#x27;ll never go back to drugstore mascara.\\&quot; But that&#x27;s not the case. Glad I tried it, and it wasn&#x27;t worthless, just not as good as Voluminous and terribly over-hyped.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash blash over this product. You get the same result for half of the price. It is not worth the price especially because a less expensive product provides the same result.</li>
            <li> This started out fantastic, and it was particularly good as separating lashes. Unfortunately, it very shortly started drying and clumping. Within a couple months, I could no longer use it and it was tossed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with my makeup -- especially my expensive makeup -- and this was always tightly sealed and used only a few times a week. It was never pumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, mascara should last much longer and behave much better. I am very disappointed. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another Dior product ever again.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t black mascara, but white undermascara.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mascara. I am on my 2nd tube but just now decided to leave my comment. I have pretty light eye lashes so if I don&#x27;t wear any mascara I look somawhat sick. This one is however my favorite to make me look the best I can be. It builds up lashes without clumping, and looks somewhat natural. Unfortunately my eyes are very sensitive to chemicals, so if I don&#x27;t wash off this mascara off very very well, I end up with blood shot eyes the next day. So I always have to put an extra effort. There is something in it that I am allergic to, otherwise there would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This mascara is excellent. It has a nice brush that coats my lashes evenly and gives it a nice dark look. I have average lashes, not too long or full, so I just need a little something to make them really pop. I read reviews where clumping was a problem and would just suggest having an old cleaned mascara wand or spoolie (target) to go over the lashes real quick after application and it takes care of the problem. also, this mascara is good for use night and with darker shadows/liners where lashes might be less noticeable. -minimal flaking.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this mascara. I was hesitant to purchase because of the price but it was so worth it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the smell;( It smells like a cheap perfume- otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> Like most of us girls, I&#x27;ve tried just about every mascara there is. For me, this one has the best combination if qualities that make it the only one to own. I bought this at Sephora because you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. Luckily, I&#x27;m in love with this mascara and have been for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is pretty near perfect; the only quibble I have is that you need to go slow and be careful in the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump. Ever. That is as long as the mascara is fresh. If you go past the three month mark or you pump air into the container, then it starts to get too thick and you&#x27;ll have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats does it for a false lash effect. Falsies within reason though - I&#x27;m not Nicki Minaj nor do I wish to be. This formula gives me long, fat lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t run, unless you happen to be walking in the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO: Expensive but *not* overpriced for what it is/does.</li>
            <li> No clumps but also no extreme length or volume but nonetheless a good mascara. Makes lashes very dark and gives a natural look</li>
            <li> Sephora suggested this product and by the reviews of the public on various websites, I plunked down the 20 or 30 something for it. First off, the brush is way too big. If you are petite like I am and have small eyes/eyelash space you will end up making a huge mess with the brush. I am a big fan of Christian Dior (don&#x27;t get me wrong, they make the best eyeshadow) but this mascara just wasn&#x27;t for me. I have had better luck with the Loreal \\&quot;ball\\&quot; mascara (black and red tube). I won&#x27;t be buying it again. You can save your money and get something a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s great! I recommend you buy it and be sure you will be satisfied. Delivery fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smoothly and without clumping, but it does not make your lashes particularly thick or longer. The Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara is a much better product that you can pick up in the drug store for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara....goes on perfectly smooth and made my lashed nice and thick. The brush is pretty thick and that helps a lot. I recommend this product 100%!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I really wanted to like this but for the name behind it and the cost, I will not buy again. Truthfully, Covergirl beats this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It plumps up my fine, almost invisible blonde lashes so well that I have eyes again!  I also like that it completely washes off.  I was using  another product that didn&#x27;t always completely wash off, despite not being waterproof at all.  And I don&#x27;t feel this product smudges any easier than anything else - in fact, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t at all.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> THE DIORSHOW MASCARA I PURCHASED WAS FAKE, I EMAILED THEM AND WAS REFUNDED WITHIN HOURS, DONT BUY FROM THESE GUYS!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It is the second tube I purchased. I have tried all of them...from the cheap ones to expensive ones...Lancome, Clinque, Chanel..etc. I read and article that some entertainer had it on because a reader wrote in about how good her eyes looked and they referenced this mascara. I have used it ever since..It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and it makes your lashes look so big! love it!</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Love it! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 was because this stuff stings the crap out of your eyes if you get it in there. If you cry, get wet, have allergies WATCH OUT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.    Like everyone has said...it lifts, and thickens like no other.  The best part is that you CAN put on layers if you want...it gives you a much more dramatic \\&quot;evening\\&quot; look when you do.  And no clumping!  Why are you still reading this?  Buy, buy, buy!</li>
            <li> I am always reading in Women&#x27;s magazines about some cheap mascara you buy in the drug store that every girl loves.  I think I could save $15, and run out to make my purchase.  Sorry girls, and anyone else who wears mascara, but the cheapies just don&#x27;t work.  I always return to Dior Show or Lancome Definicils.  p.s. I have strawberry blond hair and barely there lashes.   I need a mascara that is going to really pump up the volume and Christian Dior Show does this.  You can also quickly apply more to the ends of your lashes before it dries to create length.  Highly recommend, and the price on here far beats Sephora!</li>
            <li> I have long brown eyelashes, but they don&#x27;t look very thick. Every mascara I buy on I apply several coats in order to achieve a voluminous effect. Mascaras for volumizing seem to be dry and clumpy with more layers applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diorshow allows me to apply several layers without clumping. My eyelashes do not look dry and brittle as with other volumizing mascaras. The hearty brush encapsulates the eyelashes, coating them with rich color. It does not wear off onto my undereye - no raccoon eyes with Diorshow, unless I sleep with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight eyelashes, so I use an eyelash curler and apply Diorshow after curling. It hold the curl all day and does not weigh the eyelashes down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes by the end of a long day I just want to freshen up my eyes with more concealer without completely redoing my eye makeup. I&#x27;ll apply a few more layers of Diorshow on top of my day-old mascara. When I do this is clumps just a little bit, but no where near the competition. Other mascaras are completely useless to reapply later in the day. I feel confident reapplying Diorshow after it has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube seems to last a very long time. Purchasing other mascaras, I am surprised by how quickly the mascara dries out or begins to smell bad compared to Diorshow. I would say Diorshow can last 1.5-2 times as long as other bottles I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my job and switched to Maybelline Full &amp; Soft for a short time. I have to apply upwards of 8-10 layers of Maybelline to get the everyday effect that I want. I apply 2-4 layers Diorshow. Love it - Maybelline looks like I&#x27;m wearing no mascara next to Diorshow. Regardless of the price, I&#x27;m keeping this tube!</li>
            <li> Lucky to have found this mascara - I have to wear Non Waterproof mascara and it&#x27;s hard to come by.  Christian Dior stopped selling this &amp; I finally found some on Amazon&#x27;s website.  I bought 2, just in case!!</li>
            <li> This is really the black lace dress for the eyes....super sexy and smoldering! All the diorshow mascaras have a big and thick brush and catches all the small eyelashes. The product is hypoallergenic and really good for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS IT IS FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> Hello!Don&#x27;t like Mascara,pay more for this product,hi it&#x27;s not good:(((((((((((((((((I hate it:))))))Never buy Christian Dior Mascara Backstage Makeup :(((((((((((((((((((((((((just waist time:(((((((</li>
            <li> I have loved this mascara for a long time and was skeptical on the price but it was true! Thank you thank you!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this Mascara is supposed to be that dry or it is because it was bought through website. Anyway, I don&#x27;t like it -it feels very dry..like I was already using it for few months. I will definitely check it out in the store, but wouldn&#x27;t buy though website again for sure.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product, but from this seller my mascara was dry like it had been sitting on a shelf for four years.</li>
            <li> good very good thanks excellent product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many kinds of mascara, for more than 40 years. This ranks high on the list. Goes on very well, nice color and coverage, and I&#x27;ve seen some comments about the fragrance. I have to admit that I love it. Reminds me of roses. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the product. The only possible drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last very many weeks. But that is probably a good thing. I think it is recommended that customers replace their mascara every two months.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ! Unfortunately it was completely dried out. I will drive an hour to buy in person from now on! Very disappointing .</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras because it actually gives you crazy volume to your lashes. I am limited in my review here, if you want to see before/after pictures, check out http://makeupphase.blogspot.com/</li>
            <li> Really love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with it but it&#x27;s totally different  quality  I&#x27;m so disappointed I used to buy it for 4 years one after one all the time and I know how it should work  I&#x27;ll never ever buy it again from here&lt;br /&gt;And of course I can&#x27;t return it now coz I already used it ITS TOTALT FAKE PRODUCT I dont know who wrote that great reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  Loreal in the gold tube is more impressive and costs significantly less.  Should have listened to my makeup artist.  Loreal is the way to go.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara delivered right to my door !</li>
            <li> mascara was dry and clumpy. seemed old. packaging very cheap. paint flaking off tube i am not sure if this legit priduct, very unhappy</li>
            <li> I waited anxiously all week for this to arrive. Upon the first use I realized the mascara is very dry and flaky. I paid $30 for this thing and I am absolutely BUMMED. For that price it should be an amazing product. I will be contacting the seller and/or giving them a bad review because the mascara seems old and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was clumpy when I opened it as in probably Old- I really should have returned it because I can&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes nice &amp; thick</li>
            <li> I have loved this mascara but my last few purchases the mascara has not been the same.</li>
            <li> Been using this mascara since maybe 2004 or there abouts and I have never found a mascara that is better for my sparse and short asian lashes. Makes lashes long and thick without clumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister; this is her absolute favorite mascara.  I prefer those which are cruelty free ( not tested on animals ) but it is cool that this one also smells good!</li>
            <li> love this product but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I had some clumping issues in the beginning and didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scent in it. Luckily the mascara clumped less after a while and the scent went away, so now I quite like the mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara before after it was recommend to me while at a makeup counter in a high end store.  It thickens, goes on as dry as a mascara can and still work, and it doesn&#x27;t flake, at least not until it&#x27;s past it&#x27;s use date.  I never keep track of that date, but I find that after a few months ALL mascaras start to flake into my eyes and then I know it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used this mascara before, I was really pleased to find it on Amazon at almost $10 less than the department store, plus I didn&#x27;t have to go the mall to go to the department store.  Another plus.  While no mascara gives you the false eyelash look, this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t smudge and the brush applies just the right amount.  I don&#x27;t know what more can be said about mascara except that it&#x27;s as necessary as breathing.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about mascara products.  While heavily coating my eyelashes, this Dior product does not clump them together.  Although it is a bit pricey, it is worth the cost.</li>
