    <ol>
            <li>scent perfect, extremely good.</li>
            <li>Even better price! :D</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because the cologne smells so good.</li>
            <li>Fair price per ounce.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>However, the price through Amazon was much lower than department store prices so very happy with that!!</li>
            <li>Great updated version of tha original .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love all the Jean Paul Gaultier scents and buy them all.</li>
            <li>but i love both.</li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than in some duty free shops I&#x27;ve been in.</li>
            <li>kind of like cool water.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>has a huge vanilla note...</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just not what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li>I like clean and fresh smells that have notes of citrus, and this scent delivers.</li>
            <li>It disappears really quickly.</li>
            <li>If there was a way to extend the opener for a few more hours, I think JPG would have a winner in my eyes although most says they like the original La Male over this, and I agree, but its still a nice fresh</li>
            <li>a new scent to her male traicioal more minty and fresh really special</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite versions of the JPG Male series.  </li>
            <li>My husband smells great with this on and you only need one spray of it to last the whole day/night.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but you could have a  different take, not as sweet as Le Male...</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite next to the original.</li>
            <li>:) The cologne arrived in a blue can and a uniquely shaped bottle, but in my opinion, the scent is not fabulous.</li>
            <li>its duration is somewhat low and its wake is more intimate daily perfume for personal enjoyment</li>
            <li>different enough from the original LE Male....</li>

            <li> I like the smell, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> can wear this every single day &amp; never get tired of it...</li>
            <li> gave 3 stars due to the lack of staying power, its actually the worst staying power of any cologne I have.</li>

            <li> I like clean and fresh smells that have notes of citrus, and this scent delivers. Stays on you throughout the day too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance! I will definitely keep this in stock</li>
            <li> I love all the Jean Paul Gaultier scents and buy them all. I trade off and wear a different one every day. This is my second favorite next to the original.</li>
            <li> Great updated version of tha original .&lt;br /&gt;I can wear this every single day &amp; never get tired of it...I think its tha same scent as Monte Blanc Legend but i love both.</li>
            <li> I can write about this as I like it a lot and honestly it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than in some duty free shops I&#x27;ve been in. So do your research...or trust my word.</li>
            <li> scent perfect, extremely good.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.  This is one of my favorite versions of the JPG Male series.  My husband smells great with this on and you only need one spray of it to last the whole day/night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic cologne. But it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last. It disappears really quickly. It&#x27;s a shame because the cologne smells so good.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li> Fair price per ounce. I like the smell, but it does not last long. Maybe 1 to 2 hours before its gone. If there was a way to extend the opener for a few more hours, I think JPG would have a winner in my eyes although most says they like the original La Male over this, and I agree, but its still a nice fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 stars due to the lack of staying power, its actually the worst staying power of any cologne I have.</li>
            <li> a new scent to her male traicioal more minty and fresh really special its duration is somewhat low and its wake is more intimate daily perfume for personal enjoyment</li>
            <li> My son asked for this for Christmas because his name is Beau. :) The cologne arrived in a blue can and a uniquely shaped bottle, but in my opinion, the scent is not fabulous. It smells alright but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the high price tag. However, the price through Amazon was much lower than department store prices so very happy with that!!</li>
            <li> Not bad, just not what I thought I was ordering but No problem just use it as a work colonge.</li>
            <li> Lavender, musk, and mint....kind of like cool water. I liked it, but you could have a  different take, not as sweet as Le Male...has a huge vanilla note...a le male sweetness...white musk at the end....different enough from the original LE Male....different fragrance from LE Male....not the same...Takes a while for the scent to settle. longevity..is above average..5 to 7 hours...</li>
            <li> Nice product! Even better price! :D</li>
