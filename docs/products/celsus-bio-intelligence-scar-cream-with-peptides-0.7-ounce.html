            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>One more way Celsus helped is my cat</li>
            <li>Silicone worked better.</li>
            <li>MAKE A FORMULA THAT IS TRULY FRAGRANCE FREE!</li>
            <li>It also does a great job from preventing new scars and marks.</li>
            <li>This is an okay product for mild scars - I&#x27;ve had better luck with acid peels and niacinamide.</li>
            <li>It has been a great help with the scars left after I get raised allergic welts that peel and bleed, and even helps with the burning and pain associated with some scars, for some reason.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my skin (mostly my nose and forehead) is a lot softer and more supple</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere from people who found it useful for their acne, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will say that I think this product is extremely useful for anti-aging.</li>
            <li>This cream would work best for someone with a raised scar or flat, pigmented scar (pink, purple, brown, etc.).</li>
            <li>Remero had a large patch of fur gone and a cut, Celsus helped the cut start to heal and it is almost gone!    </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years after just a short time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way this tube will last me two more weeks.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be repurchasing.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, it normally takes 4-6 weeks to see a change in the skin, but this worked quickly and with zero irritation.</li>
            <li>Celsus has really helped my whole family!  </li>
            <li>If you really need a scar cream, hopefully it will work for you - for $20</li>
            <li>Thanks, Celsus    Karen, Westminster, CO.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear less makeup now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>BUT MY SCARS WERE NEAR MY EYES AND</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>ive used the whole tube over several months and haven&#x27;t seen a change at all in my skin.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, many of the scars were 6 months to a year old, at least.</li>
            <li>know it takes time to see significant improvement, but I&#x27;ve been using this as frequently as possible (3 to 5 times per day as instructed) and I&#x27;m almost out of it after less than a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using and buying Celsus Scar cream for a while and use it very frequently, and not only for scars, but for irritated skin and redness.</li>
            <li>My main problem with Celsus is the small blemishes and clogged pores it caused on my (extremely oily and easily clogged but not acne prone) skin.</li>
            <li>OR IF I WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO ESSENTIAL NATURAL OIL FRAGRANCES SO CLOSE TO MY EYES, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It does take a little time, but it really works.  </li>

            <li> I spent the last 8 years riddled with acne scars and extreme hyper pigmentation.</li>

            <li> This is an okay product for mild scars - I&#x27;ve had better luck with acid peels and niacinamide. My main problem with Celsus is the small blemishes and clogged pores it caused on my (extremely oily and easily clogged but not acne prone) skin. I&#x27;ve read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere from people who found it useful for their acne, so maybe it&#x27;s just me. If you really need a scar cream, hopefully it will work for you - for $20 it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great cream - I love it</li>
            <li> Celsus has really helped my whole family!  I had two bad cuts on my face and with only one week of use the were healed and gone! Before Celsus they were not healing.  Celsus has also made a big difference in my daughters whose faces are breaking out.   One more way Celsus helped is my cat Remero had a large patch of fur gone and a cut, Celsus helped the cut start to heal and it is almost gone!    Thanks, Celsus    Karen, Westminster, CO.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for small to moderate raised scar removal. It did not soften the scar or diminish the appearance. Silicone worked better.</li>
            <li> great scar cream. will buy more.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says but for me I feel it works too slow. I still have acne marks but they are fading and this product has a smell that takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing  for me. i do not recommend it to anyone,</li>
            <li> I have been using and buying Celsus Scar cream for a while and use it very frequently, and not only for scars, but for irritated skin and redness. It has been a great help with the scars left after I get raised allergic welts that peel and bleed, and even helps with the burning and pain associated with some scars, for some reason. I even use it under makeup as it calms redness and is so soothing. I find it  a wonderful product and hope to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients and customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And if you find my review helpful in any way, please click the helpful YES button and read more of my reviews on Amazon!)</li>
            <li> Best thing for acne scars!!! I tend to break out during my period and I&#x27;m usually left with some scar that turn into small brown spots/scabs. I apply this morning and night and it has helped speed up the fading process! A++ product, plus it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> Makes me break out and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying it on my face. I like the consistency and how it makes my skin look, I just wish I could buy a larger  size, I&#x27;d like to try it on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one week and I have seen a small amount of improvement in my hyper-pigmentation. I use this all over my face and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my skin (mostly my nose and forehead) is a lot softer and more supple -almost plumped up. I will say that I think this product is extremely useful for anti-aging. My skin looks better than it has in years after just a short time. I will probably order this again.&lt;br /&gt;I know it takes time to see significant improvement, but I&#x27;ve been using this as frequently as possible (3 to 5 times per day as instructed) and I&#x27;m almost out of it after less than a week. I wish it came in a larger size! There&#x27;s no way this tube will last me two more weeks.</li>
            <li> I WISH I COULD HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT BUT MY SCARS WERE NEAR MY EYES AND THE FRAGRANT OILS BALLOONED MY ENTIRE OCCULAR REGION. I DID GIVE IT A 5 STAR THOUGH AS I DID SEE IMPROVEMENT IN A SHORT TIME DESPITE THE ALLERGIC REACTION WHICH I HOPED MY EYES/FACE WOULD ADAPT TO. I DO BELIEVE IF THE SCAR WAS A BODY (VS. FACE) SCAR OR IF I WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO ESSENTIAL NATURAL OIL FRAGRANCES SO CLOSE TO MY EYES, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE PRODUCT. I HAVE HAD TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT SCAR SERUM W//O FRAGRANCE AND THE SCAR IMPROVEMENT IS NOT THERE..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE MAKE A FORMULA THAT IS TRULY FRAGRANCE FREE!</li>
            <li> I have/had acne scars all over my cheeks and chin. My face is already much improved due to this product, and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out.  I think it has actually cleared some of my acne.  I didn&#x27;t have any pits just discoloration.  It has also helped out my melasma too.  I love it and will definitely be repurchasing.  It does take a little time, but it really works.  I am able to wear less makeup now.</li>
            <li> I tried using this to reduce dark scarring on my legs from scratching mosquito bites.  Didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.  Smells good and isn&#x27;t drying, but didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> ive used the whole tube over several months and haven&#x27;t seen a change at all in my skin. was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 months now and I have definitely have to say that I have noticed a difference in my skin. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with this scar cream. I had a small cluster of little old little blemish scars that looked like freckles. I followed their instructions of massaging the cream in to the affected area a few times a day and once before bedtime. The scars were 100% gone within a week and a half (!). In my experience, it normally takes 4-6 weeks to see a change in the skin, but this worked quickly and with zero irritation. It also does a great job from preventing new scars and marks. This cream would work best for someone with a raised scar or flat, pigmented scar (pink, purple, brown, etc.). Those with icepick scars or pitted scarring will probably not see results from this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Stephanie&lt;br /&gt;{Epic Beauty Guide {dot} com}</li>
            <li> I spent the last 8 years riddled with acne scars and extreme hyper pigmentation. If I got a blemish, viola! it automatically became a dark spot, and that&#x27;s when I didn&#x27;t pick at it. If it was picked on, look out scabs. Celsus scar cream got rid of my polka dot/uneven/blotchy face in only 3 weeks! Keep in mind, many of the scars were 6 months to a year old, at least. My only complaint is, I wish I had known about this stuff sooner. They need advertising</li>
