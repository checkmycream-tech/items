            <li>Great buy.  </li>
            <li>Great design.</li>
            <li>The product worked great</li>
            <li>It has been great for baths as well.</li>
            <li>Best thing since sliced bread...did the plastic bag and duct tape ONCE and said &amp;#34;there&#x27;s got to be a better way&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am glad for the purchase, as nothing would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>We followed the measurement guidelines and even wrapped my daughters cast with Glad Press and Seal, for good measure.  </li>
            <li>, I went looking for a solution and was thrilled when I found this product.  </li>
            <li>First one was great.</li>
            <li>I needed to make sure my 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li>;... have a cast from just below the knee down...used it over and over and over again, able to take a shower every day...</li>
            <li>Just make sure to pump out all the air</li>
            <li>Great qualtiy, makes having a cast much easier</li>
            <li>He was so depressed about not being able to enjoy the water while we were at the resort</li>
            <li>so I purchased a full leg cover for her post op care.  </li>
            <li>keeps dry even when swimming in the pool its great also in the shower, overall very happy and can recommend this produkt to every one with a cast and or bandage which cannot not get wet</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>If I would have gone in the water with this, it would have fallen right off.</li>
            <li>The seal seems very easy to loosen, so he&#x27;s been extra cautious with it, but the cover has done the job and still keeps the water out even after a dozen or so uses.</li>
            <li>I also ordered DryCast, which is more cumbersome and seems less secure, even if it&#x27;s a bit easier to get on and off.</li>
            <li>We found that we have to hold the cover away from her leg in order for the pump to work properly, and it works better if the leg is out straight when you are trying to pump the air out of it.  </li>
            <li>Also, had I realized how tight the top would be, I would have ordered the full leg LARGE, not medium as their sizing suggested.  </li>
            <li>The first time was great, Second time had a slight leak.</li>
            <li>3rd time was fine.</li>
            <li>(the walking boot is too big to fit in this thing), and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a broken leg!!</li>
            <li>The top 2&amp;#34; where it is supposed to seal, wants to roll down as you flex your leg.</li>
            <li>Amazing and saved my leg from getting wet and saved my tears from not totally ruining my vaca.</li>
            <li>The cast stayed dry with the extra precautions and he was able to enjoy several days at the pool.  </li>
            <li>I love how you can pump the air out to make a very tight seal.  </li>
            <li>cast NEVER got wet...folds up into a tiny package that fit in my suitcase on a recent trip...</li>
            <li>Although this was advertised as the appropriate size for a full leg cast, the length of the cast cover is way too small for a mid-thigh to foot, full leg cast worn by an adult male of average height.  </li>
            <li>My eleven year old son fractured his ankle 1 week before our trip to Florida.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money spent...</li>
            <li>He had a half cast but we purchased the full leg cover.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does create a visible vacuum, but it is a bit of a struggle to get it off a leg cast.</li>
            <li> worked very well, water tight and kept my cast very dry</li>
            <li> The fit was wrong, WAY TO BIG!!</li>
            <li> The only one that truly keeps your wound site or cast dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and have long legs and this covered my foot while in a driving boot</li>
            <li> The second time I used water leaked in and my foot was wet, I poured water out.  </li>
            <li> This is a knockoff made by dry pro.</li>
            <li> This cast cover came through and kept my wounds dry while showering.  </li>
            <li> ; incision didn&#x27;t get wet for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery on my knee and it did not get wet.</li>
            <li> Be careful with these.</li>
            <li> Getting the cast wet is NOT something we wanted to risk.</li>
            <li> After a few tries and a short learning curve, she was in business!  </li>
            <li> Pretty useless unless it&#x27;s for children or dwarves.</li>
            <li> There was a little leakage around the plug but not much.  </li>
            <li> I was still a little cautious</li>
            <li> It could not fit in the playbook.</li>
            <li> Although it is heavy, it is manageable along with a shower/tub stool.  </li>
            <li> We were not brave enough to try the beach.  </li>
            <li> 4th time soaked the cast resulting in an expensive trip to the ER.</li>
            <li> Badly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great buy.  My mother had foot surgery so I purchased a full leg cover for her post op care.  This allowed her independence with showering in a cast.</li>
            <li> I used this after my surgery last year when we already had vacation plans. HALLELUUAH!!!!!    Amazing and saved my leg from getting wet and saved my tears from not totally ruining my vaca.</li>
            <li> Although this was advertised as the appropriate size for a full leg cast, the length of the cast cover is way too small for a mid-thigh to foot, full leg cast worn by an adult male of average height.  Pretty useless unless it&#x27;s for children or dwarves.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover my foot after surgery for taking showers.  I needed to make sure my 7&amp;#34; incision didn&#x27;t get wet for 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and have long legs and this covered my foot while in a driving boot (the walking boot is too big to fit in this thing), and it worked really well.  I love how you can pump the air out to make a very tight seal.  Great design.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread...did the plastic bag and duct tape ONCE and said &amp;#34;there&#x27;s got to be a better way&amp;#34;... have a cast from just below the knee down...used it over and over and over again, able to take a shower every day... cast NEVER got wet...folds up into a tiny package that fit in my suitcase on a recent trip... getting my cast off soon...well worth the money spent...</li>
            <li> It could not fit in the playbook. Bogus part. Product is a lie. Do not buy.  I need my money back.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to use with her leg cast.  Although it is heavy, it is manageable along with a shower/tub stool.  We found that we have to hold the cover away from her leg in order for the pump to work properly, and it works better if the leg is out straight when you are trying to pump the air out of it.  After a few tries and a short learning curve, she was in business!  Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I bought this product under the assumption that it was a Xerosox product because that is what it is listed as. IT IS NOT!! This is a knockoff made by dry pro. It is definately not the same. The fit was wrong, WAY TO BIG!! If I would have gone in the water with this, it would have fallen right off. I have bought the product by XEROSOX before and had NO problems. This one is simply not what it is advertised as. BEWARE!!!!</li>
            <li> We followed the measurement guidelines and even wrapped my daughters cast with Glad Press and Seal, for good measure.  Her foot was soaked. Boo.</li>
            <li> This cast cover came through and kept my wounds dry while showering.  Just make sure to pump out all the air and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> The product worked great but I felt it was used and then returned.</li>
            <li> The second time I used water leaked in and my foot was wet, I poured water out.  Good thing I had surgery on my knee and it did not get wet.</li>
            <li> My eleven year old son fractured his ankle 1 week before our trip to Florida.  He was so depressed about not being able to enjoy the water while we were at the resort, I went looking for a solution and was thrilled when I found this product.  He had a half cast but we purchased the full leg cover.  I was still a little cautious so we wrapped his cast in a plastic bag and then secured it with an ace bandage before putting on the cast cover.  There was a little leakage around the plug but not much.  The cast stayed dry with the extra precautions and he was able to enjoy several days at the pool.  We were not brave enough to try the beach.  It has been great for baths as well.</li>
            <li> Was properly sized and put on. Used it 4 times. The first time was great, Second time had a slight leak. 3rd time was fine. 4th time soaked the cast resulting in an expensive trip to the ER. Be careful with these.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cast cover prior to my husband&#x27;s ankle surgery. Getting the cast wet is NOT something we wanted to risk. The seal seems very easy to loosen, so he&#x27;s been extra cautious with it, but the cover has done the job and still keeps the water out even after a dozen or so uses.</li>
            <li> This was my second. First one was great. This one leaked. Badly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a broken leg!!</li>
            <li> This device works in the shower, but I am leery about trying it in a tub or jacuzzi. The top 2&amp;#34; where it is supposed to seal, wants to roll down as you flex your leg. Also, had I realized how tight the top would be, I would have ordered the full leg LARGE, not medium as their sizing suggested.  It does create a visible vacuum, but it is a bit of a struggle to get it off a leg cast. However, it is nicer and safer than a plastic bag and masking tape, which had been my prior strategy. I am glad for the purchase, as nothing would be perfect.  I also ordered DryCast, which is more cumbersome and seems less secure, even if it&#x27;s a bit easier to get on and off.</li>
            <li> The only one that truly keeps your wound site or cast dry.</li>
            <li> Great qualtiy, makes having a cast much easier</li>
            <li> Produkt works as described my cast keeps dry even when swimming in the pool its great also in the shower, overall very happy and can recommend this produkt to every one with a cast and or bandage which cannot not get wet</li>
            <li> worked very well, water tight and kept my cast very dry</li>
