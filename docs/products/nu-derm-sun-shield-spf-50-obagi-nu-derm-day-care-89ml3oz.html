            <li>Great Product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this product - it&#x27;s easily worn under my make up.</li>

            <li>I was always wondering when to put sunblock or sunscreen on and found out if sunblock contains oxybenzone or avobenzone it should go on clean bare skin as it needs time to be absorbed if it conains titanium dioxide or zink oxide can be applied after moisturizers etc.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a high SPF with high zinc percentage sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The extra cost is worth it.  </li>
            <li>When I spread it on my face, my face becomes white at first</li>
            <li>In addition, this doesn&#x27;t give very thick feeling and works just fine.</li>

            <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not greasy and penetrates well into the skin. I found it in amazon.com and I tried it because I have used some products from Obagi. Now I think it is the best.</li>
            <li> I tried some cheaper OTC sunscreens that left little sunscreens balls in the creases.  Nu Derm is perfect and does not interfere with my makeup or powder.  In the desert (or anywhere) daily sunscreen is a MUST and Nu Derm makes it easy.</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. Love that it&#x27;s SPF 50. Also love that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and it does an excellent job.  The zinc component provides another level of protection that enhances the protection.</li>
            <li> Great Product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i use this before i go outside to exercise and it does leave a little bit of white residue when i sweat</li>
            <li> Love this. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Odorless, and never get acne. Non-greasy feel. The extra cost is worth it.  Tube last 4 months applying to face only daily.</li>
            <li> The SPF 50 in this product is a n absolute must in the hot Texas sun!  I love this product - it&#x27;s easily worn under my make up.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen! Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Also does not sting around the eyes, which always seems to be the case with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Pricey but I like it because it doesn&#x27;t turn your face white.  I do hate sunblock but had had face cancer so am more than faithful on sunblock.  This one contains 10.5 zink oxide so can be applied after your moisturizer etc.  I was always wondering when to put sunblock or sunscreen on and found out if sunblock contains oxybenzone or avobenzone it should go on clean bare skin as it needs time to be absorbed if it conains titanium dioxide or zink oxide can be applied after moisturizers etc.  I use this on my face and a cheaper one on my body.</li>
            <li> As a person with a history of skin cancer, I am very careful to always wear sun protection. This product blocks the sun&#x27;s rays but is light enough to easily wear under make-up.  It is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Overall the protection of harmful UV rays are good. Does not feel oily after application on to the face. Will consider buying product again.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for a couple of years.  I think it is the best SPF product on the market.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for a good product.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it goes on smoothly.  The tube lasts for about six months so it is a good value.</li>
            <li> This actually disappears after application . So many sunscreens of this strength do not.  This one is non greasy and can have makeup applied over it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice sunscreen.  Absorbs well, not greasy.  Been using if for years with the Nu Derm line, but would use it regardless.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great sunscreen/lotion.  I have tried just about every sunscreen in existence and this works well.  I do not like greasy or heavy sunscreens and this absorbs very quickly and is very light.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high SPF with high zinc percentage sunscreen. This is a great and reasonable product. When I spread it on my face, my face becomes white at first but I can massage into my skin and whiteness disappears. In addition, this doesn&#x27;t give very thick feeling and works just fine. I love it and I will buy it again!</li>
