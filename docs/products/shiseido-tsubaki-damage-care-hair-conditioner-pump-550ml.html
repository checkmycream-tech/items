            <li>, is a very good hair conditioner , good for hair , I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but it is pricey in the US.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and is more manageable now, I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>like, it is much better than before.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is better than it&#x27;s been in two years, and I will be able to highlight again now.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite conditioner!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner works really well to smooth hair, and help it look healthy!</li>
            <li>just little bit is perfect</li>
            <li>Duty Free while flying,</li>
            <li>Since switching to this conditioner my hair has been silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It just confirmed to me that I was using it correctly (for those of you who are reading this review</li>
            <li>Nothing made my hair silky smooth like this product.</li>
            <li>After using the conditioner, my hair looks so smooth like I had ironed it.</li>
            <li>The red shampoo from the Shining line is great though.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>It feels like your hair rinses clean, which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many women envy how much hair I have and go to touch it, I repeatedly wanted to cut my hair off because it&#x27;s too much and a pain to take care of.</li>
            <li>But this is definitely worth investing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine, so is weighted down and dulled by using the oils that are so popular now (i.e. Moroccan oil).  </li>
            <li>My hair is far from perfect but this is one of the few products that can address the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li>Great conditionner, as usual</li>
            <li>I like to let it soak in for a few minutes before rinsing it in warm clean water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much easier to comb after I shower!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist commented that my hair is in much better condition since I started using it; it&#x27;s the only thing I changed, so it has to be the conditioner!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a number of things that the Japanese do better than the rest of the world - this Hair Conditioner is one of them.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product in the damage care set.</li>
            <li>All of reviews I read were positive</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft even when I use a medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li>Really cleans and conditions</li>
            <li>I lost some hair if you put too much</li>
            <li>I have used Biolage, Wen, Redskin, even every cheap brands from the grocery store etc., and would get the same results.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this product really does help.</li>
            <li>Thank you Shiseido for making a conditioner where I can finally really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I had very low expectations in purchasing this product, but after one use my hair was soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft!!!  </li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair and wash it every day.</li>
            <li>It lends more to the sleek appearance but does not weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li>In Okinawa in particular, we found the water so heavily full of dissolved minerals that the tray under our dish drying tray would be coated in a sheet of calcium that could be peeled from the tray after only a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend shiseido products to family and friends.</li>
            <li>THIS conditioner fought that, and we find back in the States and Tsubaki Golden Repair Conditioner makes even my new bristly beard baby</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time use the hair conditioner, and I hope it can have the same effect.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>First of all, my hair is super frizzy and expands like a sponge sometimes, and I just want a conditioner to help tame it.</li>
            <li>and when I first tried this, I was kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair dry naturally then hot iron my hair.</li>
            <li>have much longer hair so have to use several pumps, so hopefully I get to maximize my use.</li>
            <li>It.makes your hair supper soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I have very curly, coarse hair and since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li>and so my hair has gotten pretty damaged and dry</li>
            <li>If not moisturized correctly, it becomes puffy, unruly and a true hideous mess.</li>
            <li>Although it seems pricey, it is a big bottle and not very much is needed, so it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The Mrs. and I had the pleasure to live a number of years in Japan, where she found this conditioner, and used it religiously.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not really into buying expensive products that only one of us find helpful to use, so we&#x27;ve been trying out various brands to try to find a conditioner we could both be happy with.</li>
            <li>I also live in a very dry area so my hair is practically fried every day.</li>
            <li>but my hair is much softer and way less frizzy.</li>
            <li>My partner and I have been searching for quite a while for bath products that are amenable to his coarse, impossibly straight Asian hair and my thick, curly white girl hair.</li>

            <li> This is the only conditioner that doesn&#x27;t tangle even if I don&#x27;t brush and blow out my hair to dry.   </li>
            <li> I have very dry long hair to mid back.</li>
            <li> I have been use the Shiseido Shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again in the future after I finish all my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Took away the dry, straw texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hair person, I used to use grocery shampoo for awhile.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse asian hair.</li>
            <li> This is one product I definitely want to review, because it has made a significant difference in the condition of my hair, which was damaged from highlights and a bad cut.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is shinier and less frizzy than I&#x27;ve had it in a long time.</li>
            <li> However, this actually makes my hair look  softer than usual and makes it look less dry.</li>
            <li> For my hair it&#x27;s no better than any product you buy at the local</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t compare to any other brands I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> Other conditioners that are too moisturizing or silky also dulled my hair.  </li>
            <li> Because, really, it just gets too complicated when you have a number of bath products for just two people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pair it with chi silk infusion to keep the volume down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super luscious, silky hair, but my hair has improved after I started using this.</li>
            <li> In contrast, this conditioner leaves my hair silkier, less tangled, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, curly, processed or dry this is for you.</li>
            <li> i think it can be used everyday</li>
            <li> the bottle I received thru Amazon was all in Japanese so there is a slight chance I&#x27;m using it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair quite a lot over the past few years</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but it&#x27;s almost too thick.</li>
            <li> But can I be using it wrong?  </li>
            <li> thinking I&#x27;m using it wrong.)</li>
            <li> Conditions well, but has a artificial flowery smell that I dislike.</li>
            <li> The shampoo from the Damage Care line is terrible, it retexturizes hair and makes it feel like straw.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very long fine hair and wash it every day. This is the only conditioner that doesn&#x27;t tangle even if I don&#x27;t brush and blow out my hair to dry.   Bought it Duty Free while flying, and now I&#x27;m ordering online. If you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> The product makes my hair silky after I use it. Also, the fragrance of the shampoo makes me feel refreshed. Love this product, but it is pricey in the US. HongKong has very good ideal on this product. It&#x27;s only $10 for a container :0(</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of keeping my hair soft. I really liked the scent. I will buy this again in the future after I finish all my other conditioners.</li>

            <li> For my hair it&#x27;s no better than any product you buy at the local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the bottle I received thru Amazon was all in Japanese so there is a slight chance I&#x27;m using it wrong.  But can I be using it wrong?  It&#x27;s just conditioner, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually found the same product at a local Chinese supermarket and on their bottles there&#x27;s an extra sticker that&#x27;s in English.  It just confirmed to me that I was using it correctly (for those of you who are reading this review thinking I&#x27;m using it wrong.)</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and shiny. Took away the dry, straw texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this conditioner with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I had very low expectations in purchasing this product, but after one use my hair was soft and healthy looking. I will now buy the shampoo to use in conjunction with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have much longer hair so have to use several pumps, so hopefully I get to maximize my use. But this is definitely worth investing.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really cleans and conditions well  would recommend</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but it&#x27;s almost too thick. If your hair is thick, curly, processed or dry this is for you.</li>
            <li> use combine with the hair shampoo set, my hair begin shine and smell good. i think it can be used everyday</li>
            <li> I Love!!!!  It.makes your hair supper soft and shiny I lost some hair if you put too much just little bit is perfect</li>
            <li> I have very dry long hair to mid back. I have used Biolage, Wen, Redskin, even every cheap brands from the grocery store etc., and would get the same results. Nothing made my hair silky smooth like this product. I normally let my hair dry naturally then hot iron my hair. After using the conditioner, my hair looks so smooth like I had ironed it. Amazing result on a chance purchase I made. Will buy  the shampoo next. For my hair, one pump of conditioner is all that is needed, two pumps and hair turned out somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Shiseido&#x27;s product. I have been use the Shiseido Shampoo for a long time. It&#x27;s my first time use the hair conditioner, and I hope it can have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hair person, I used to use grocery shampoo for awhile. But then I switched to Wella, and when that seemed to not work anymore, I thought this Shiseido would help my Asian hair. First of all, my hair is super frizzy and expands like a sponge sometimes, and I just want a conditioner to help tame it. I also live in a very dry area so my hair is practically fried every day. To my surprise, this product really does help. My hair feels softer and is more manageable now, I can&#x27;t believe it. I also bought the accompanying Tsubaki hair mask and while my hair isn&#x27;t exactly TV commercial like, it is much better than before.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite conditioner!  Makes my hair feel so soft!!!  It just doesn&#x27;t compare to any other brands I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  Thank you Shiseido for making a conditioner where I can finally really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> good shampoo.. and love the smell</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair super soft even when I use a medicated shampoo. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week but my hair is much softer and way less frizzy. I have very curly, coarse hair and since I&#x27;ve been using this it&#x27;s so much easier to comb after I shower! I love it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.My hair feels soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I just found this product here so I bought it here, is a very good hair conditioner , good for hair , I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one product I definitely want to review, because it has made a significant difference in the condition of my hair, which was damaged from highlights and a bad cut.  I have been trying to get my hair back in shape for two years.  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine, so is weighted down and dulled by using the oils that are so popular now (i.e. Moroccan oil).  Other conditioners that are too moisturizing or silky also dulled my hair.  In contrast, this conditioner leaves my hair silkier, less tangled, and shiny.  It lends more to the sleek appearance but does not weigh my hair down at all.  I was worried because it does contain an oil, but definitely has not dulled my hair, and I have used it now for several weeks.  Although it seems pricey, it is a big bottle and not very much is needed, so it is worth the money.  My hair stylist commented that my hair is in much better condition since I started using it; it&#x27;s the only thing I changed, so it has to be the conditioner!  My hair is better than it&#x27;s been in two years, and I will be able to highlight again now.</li>
            <li> Tsubaki conditioner is unlike anything we can find in the U.S.  The Mrs. and I had the pleasure to live a number of years in Japan, where she found this conditioner, and used it religiously.  In Okinawa in particular, we found the water so heavily full of dissolved minerals that the tray under our dish drying tray would be coated in a sheet of calcium that could be peeled from the tray after only a couple of uses.  THIS conditioner fought that, and we find back in the States and Tsubaki Golden Repair Conditioner makes even my new bristly beard baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of things that the Japanese do better than the rest of the world - this Hair Conditioner is one of them.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in the damage care set. The conditioner works really well to smooth hair, and help it look healthy! The shampoo from the Damage Care line is terrible, it retexturizes hair and makes it feel like straw. The red shampoo from the Shining line is great though. Both products smell AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I noticed excellent results after one wash.  Would highly recommend shiseido products to family and friends.</li>
            <li> My partner and I have been searching for quite a while for bath products that are amenable to his coarse, impossibly straight Asian hair and my thick, curly white girl hair. We&#x27;re not really into buying expensive products that only one of us find helpful to use, so we&#x27;ve been trying out various brands to try to find a conditioner we could both be happy with. Because, really, it just gets too complicated when you have a number of bath products for just two people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found mention of the Shiseido Tsubaki Damage Hair Conditioner when I was lurking on web forums trying to find a conditioner that would help soften and lighten up my partner&#x27;s hair. All of reviews I read were positive so I decided to buy a bottle and see how it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hair his shinier, healthier, and softer than I&#x27;ve ever seen it and my hair is shinier and less frizzy than I&#x27;ve had it in a long time. It feels like your hair rinses clean, which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Conditions well, but has a artificial flowery smell that I dislike.</li>
