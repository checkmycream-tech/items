            <li> I have been using this product for a long time ... something like 8-10 years.  As other reviewers have noted, it is a bit pricey.  But, it works!!!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people are amazed at how old I am when they ask me.  I think some of that has to do with this great product.  I&#x27;ll keep buying and using it.  I only use it every other day, and I use just one pump of the dispenser each time.</li>

The price is too high for the amount you get; however, I have yet to find a better face lotion for overnight.  It goes on cleanly.  Until I find a replacement that is equally good at a better price, this is it.</li>
