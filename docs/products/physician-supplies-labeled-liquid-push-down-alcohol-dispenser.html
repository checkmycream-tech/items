            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This dispenser has a much better dispenser cap then another I had purchased on ebay.</li>
            <li>Dispenser takes many, many pumps to get any alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It takes some trying to screw the top on evenly.  </li>
            <li>After filling it with alcohol (liquid) and pumping it, the liquid comes out but after not using it for a day, one has to pump it many times to get the liquid to dispense.  </li>
            <li>perfect and ends the use to hve to tear open a pouch and use 3 hands; gauze pad pump pump done.  </li>
            <li>Now I just grab a Kleenex, give the pump a pump, and presto! Clean Glasses!</li>
            <li>It works, but not as easy as we wanted.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not so easy on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I needed a push down pump bottle and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I took it out of the box and filled it with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Good dispenser for alcohol when you need to be able to access with only one hand.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use when I&#x27;m crafting and need an alcohol soaked cotton ball or cotton swab for quick and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Never bad</li>
            <li>This is a has to hae or be in any busy place where you need more or less alcohol; I use 70% Isoprophyl alchol, pump works great :)</li>
            <li>I find I have to push far more</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.  </li>
            <li>This one is plastic which is fine for my use and dispenses a decent amount of liquid into an ample concavity in the lid area.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, single-handed alcohol dispenser.  </li>
            <li>and it works exactly as we hoped it would.</li>
            <li>This met our needs and is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Within the first month, we had to stop using this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It takes about 20-30 pumps to get fluid to the top.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even work the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>This seems very sturdy and is easy to pump using only one hand.</li>
            <li>No matter how much pumping we do it does not dispense any alcohol.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, no problems.  </li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>It works well and is very convinient.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be high quality as well!</li>
            <li>Has to be primed for it to work, which seems reasonable, but was hoping that it would be ready to go everytime.</li>
            <li>The dispenser looks much like the one I had before</li>
            <li>Very durable and will hold 99% alcohol, which is what I use it for while doing nails.</li>
            <li>There was not enough pumping action to get the alcohol up to the top.</li>
            <li>the top white pump was not the same as pictured!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so have high hopes for this one Recommend.</li>
            <li>&gt; A small amount of liquid came out but at great force and squirts past cotton ball.</li>
            <li>If you need frequent alcohol wipes, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>I use it while carving prcelain carvings to get small amounts of water on a brush to refine and smooth the carved area of the sculpture.</li>
            <li>I have similar looking dispensers that have worked in a busy dental office for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I pushed on the dispenser and not a single drop came out.</li>
            <li>This is a handle little container that makes dispensing rubbing alcohol much quicker and easier!</li>
            <li>I keep a small jar of cotton balls right next to it</li>

            <li> Less than average quality</li>

            <li> I am definitely going to be looking for a different type of dispenser because these are so badly made.</li>

            <li> Because our experience with them in a medical office has been just THAT bad.  </li>
            <li> mine was broken out of the box...</li>
            <li> The plastic use is very thin.</li>
            <li> Product is lousy!</li>

            <li> Works great.  If you need frequent alcohol wipes, this is the way to go.  It works everytime.[[ASIN:B0007YT17W Push Down Alcohol Dispenser - Push Down]]</li>
            <li> No matter how much pumping we do it does not dispense any alcohol. We were very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a convenient alcohol dispenser. I found that I would loose my Q-tip in the regular bottle. This dispenser does not make a decorating statement, but it is convenient and functional.</li>
            <li> Keeps the alcohol at my fingertips and does not evaporate. Wish it did not say alcohol on it. Might use it for other liquids</li>
            <li> works great I love it. One handed to use for cotton balls</li>
            <li> Slow shipping. Product good</li>
            <li> Broke on the 2nd use.  My employee didn&#x27;t tell me or it would have been returned...arrggh</li>
            <li> I have similar looking dispensers that have worked in a busy dental office for over 15 years.  Unfortunately, these ones stopped working after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, single-handed alcohol dispenser.  Arrived fast, no problems.  Sometimes the alcohol shoots up like a fountain so you have to be careful how hard you press down.</li>
            <li> the top white pump was not the same as pictured!!!&lt;br /&gt; A small amount of liquid came out but at great force and squirts past cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I have a cat that gets too playful. When she&#x27;s playing with me she sometimes scratches me or even bite a little. Never bad but I always want to put some alcohol on it. This bottle is  just the thing for me. I keep a small jar of cotton balls right next to it and it is so convenient to use. I absolutely love it. I have already told a couple other cat owners about this.</li>
            <li> PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED - MY WIFE A RETIRED MD CONCURS RAY BALBUTIN JR</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, does what it needs to do &amp; very well. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product in good condition. I took it out of the box and filled it with alcohol. I pushed on the dispenser and not a single drop came out. I unscrewed the dispenser from the bottle and when I shook it, it sounded like a bunch of parts rattling around in the mechanism. I guess they don&#x27;t test them before they ship them to customers... mine was broken out of the box... It was the cheapest one so I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Who writes a review about a dispenser?  I do.  Because our experience with them in a medical office has been just THAT bad.  We have purchased about 6 of these dispensers and we never know if it will actually work when we receive it.  I am definitely going to be looking for a different type of dispenser because these are so badly made.</li>
            <li> I needed a push down pump bottle and this was perfect.  It works well and is very convinient.  Good price.</li>
            <li> and it works exactly as we hoped it would. This met our needs and is exactly what we wanted. Seems to be high quality as well!</li>
            <li> Has to be primed for it to work, which seems reasonable, but was hoping that it would be ready to go everytime.</li>
            <li> Best advice:\\&quot;don&#x27;t buy!\\&quot;  Product is lousy! Doesn&#x27;t work as it is supposed too.[[ASIN:B0008GCVU8 Liquid Push Down Alcohol Dispenser Labeled]]</li>
            <li> The dispenser works well, but I have a feeling it wont&#x27; last that long. The plastic use is very thin.</li>
            <li> Good price and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and liked it so ordered a duplicate when I needed another one.</li>
            <li> 2 in the family take allergy injections at home so this is awesome in helping me.</li>
            <li> Less than average quality</li>
            <li> Needed an alcohol dispenser to sit out on sink and this works great with cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Within the first month, we had to stop using this product. There was not enough pumping action to get the alcohol up to the top.</li>
            <li> Guess it works, sometimes it just gets stuck, but give it a few pumps and it&#x27;ll be back and kicking. Would be buying again if I need in the future.</li>
            <li> You know, I work part time for an eye doctor, and so use alcohol pumps at work, but hardly ever cleaned my glasses at home, because since we used alcohol but had no pump, it was such a pain to get the alcohol out, get out Kleenex, etc. Now I just grab a Kleenex, give the pump a pump, and presto! Clean Glasses!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple of days, now we have to take the top off most days to get the alcohol out.</li>
            <li> Good dispenser for alcohol when you need to be able to access with only one hand.  No lid to take off and on or drop.</li>
            <li> This is a handle little container that makes dispensing rubbing alcohol much quicker and easier!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This dispenser has a much better dispenser cap then another I had purchased on ebay. I previously had a medical grade one from a scientific lab supplier that came with a glass bottle. This one is plastic which is fine for my use and dispenses a decent amount of liquid into an ample concavity in the lid area. The dispenser looks much like the one I had before and that one lasted over 10 years so have high hopes for this one Recommend. I use it while carving prcelain carvings to get small amounts of water on a brush to refine and smooth the carved area of the sculpture.</li>
            <li> We vaccinate squirmy kittens.  This allows us to use alcohol, one handed. I have been looking for one a while.</li>
            <li> Has issues with the 1st one priming.  Now the replacement is doing it.  It works, but not as easy as we wanted.</li>
            <li> I saw these in my doctor&#x27;s office and had to have one.  It keeps you from wasting alcohol and from having to open and close bottles.  Great price and works great, thanks.</li>
            <li> Very durable and will hold 99% alcohol, which is what I use it for while doing nails. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I find I have to push far more than I should before I get alcohol out of here.  Also it&#x27;s not so easy on the eyes.  Might buy another type if I had to do it all different.</li>
            <li> Dispenser takes many, many pumps to get any alcohol.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this type again. Sad because my previous one which lasted over 10 years had a smaller top and you got alcohol with one pump. The design change was an oops.</li>
            <li> This seems very sturdy and is easy to pump using only one hand. I bought it to use when I&#x27;m crafting and need an alcohol soaked cotton ball or cotton swab for quick and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> It takes some trying to screw the top on evenly.  After filling it with alcohol (liquid) and pumping it, the liquid comes out but after not using it for a day, one has to pump it many times to get the liquid to dispense.  Hint: Cover the holes with your finger to create some vacuum.</li>
            <li> Unless the container is full,MIT will not pump fluid up to the dispenser.  It takes about 20-30 pumps to get fluid to the top.  No functional at all. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work the first time I used it.  Wanted to send it back but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.  Going to try to find something similar locally.</li>
            <li> perfect and ends the use to hve to tear open a pouch and use 3 hands; gauze pad pump pump done.  This is a has to hae or be in any busy place where you need more or less alcohol; I use 70% Isoprophyl alchol, pump works great :)</li>
