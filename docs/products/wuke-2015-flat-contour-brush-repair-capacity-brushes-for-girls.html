            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bush for contouring.</li>
            <li>I love the size of it.</li>
            <li>I use my more expense brush to blend.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>When receiving the brush it had a smell of paint but overall great brush for the price!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to for a fair price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and the wooden handle is the perfect length and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>This brush is soft and is great for placing and blending contour.</li>
            <li>Over time, this brush started expanding a bit but other then that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I can easily picture this one sold by Channel, at x10 at the price.</li>
            <li>This brush was a great buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>Great item would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean..</li>
            <li>cheap but does the job</li>
            <li>I paid about $5 for it and the quality makes it worth much more than that.  </li>
            <li>This brush would also be good for cream products and would likely blend them just as easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the similarly shaped MAC or Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.  </li>
            <li>super quality brush.</li>
            <li>but i do think it worth the price.</li>
            <li>Fun brush but had a chemical smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten a contour quite this good with any other brush.</li>
            <li>Then there is just the right amount of product to blend.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big size, has very soft bristles, a sturdy handle and unique design.</li>
            <li>nothing i cant fix and the smell of paint but aired it out and its fine</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very affordable and fits what I was looking for in a contour brush!</li>
            <li>Picks up too much product and cannot be as precise as desired, although brush bristles are soft and densely packed.</li>
            <li>Super soft &amp; gives a nice sharp contour.</li>
            <li>The tightly packed bristles pick up just the right amount of powdered bronzer and it&#x27;s very easy to blend the powder once it&#x27;s on the cheek.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it…and it is a BARGAIN!</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Keep this brush clean (at least once a week), and it will be your favorite, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush just like this for a long time but couldn&#x27;t find anything to fit my budget, until now.  </li>
            <li>At first touch, it was dense and soft and I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, applies really well, and it blends out really well.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a contour brush such as this for the longest time - and I got lucky that I found one</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found such a nice brush for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft, but not too soft like the NARS brush which barely picks up enough product and the bristles just crumble while trying to apply which certainly doesn&#x27;t give a clean line.  </li>
            <li>Very soft hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it and aired it out - but smell seems to linger a bit.</li>
            <li>Overall the quality of the brush is good, but not ideal for contouring.</li>
            <li>This brush has dense bristles that pick up lots of product and give me such a sharp, clean line where I want to contour.  </li>
            <li>Does not shed, the hair feels soft and luxurious; very comparable to more expensive brands.</li>

            <li> It needs to be slightly domed, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> The hadle is a little lose but that&#x27;s all I can complain about.</li>
            <li> I reach PAST my NARS  brush for this one every time.  </li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to arrive, and when it did I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Grat for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Fun brush but had a chemical smell</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to arrive, and when it did I was disappointed. At first touch, it was dense and soft and I had high hopes. But when I applied contour color, it deposited color in two lines, with a negative space in the middle. It needs to be slightly domed, but it&#x27;s not. I had to go buy a $30 replacement to get what I wanted.</li>
            <li> cheap but does the job</li>
            <li> i love it its very smooth nd blendable just recommend</li>
            <li> Arrived before date given only down about it is the glue from the handle is lose but nothing i cant fix and the smell of paint but aired it out and its fine</li>
            <li> Picks up too much product and cannot be as precise as desired, although brush bristles are soft and densely packed. Overall the quality of the brush is good, but not ideal for contouring. Will need to find another use for it.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and is great for placing and blending contour. It is one of 2 contour brushes I have and i prefer this one. It does the job wonderfully and is durable and very well made</li>
            <li> Very soft brush and has a good weight to it. The reason i gave it 4 Stars is because of the smell... It has a very strong super-glue like smell... I&#x27;ve washed it and aired it out - but smell seems to linger a bit.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! It blends out my bronzer perfectly. I love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> What a nice brush!  It&#x27;s very soft and the bristles are densely packed, making it perfect for contouring.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush just like this for a long time but couldn&#x27;t find anything to fit my budget, until now.  This brush is comparable in quality and performance to much more expensive brands.  It&#x27;s as good as the similarly shaped MAC or Sigma brushes.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and the wooden handle is the perfect length and comfortable to use.  The tightly packed bristles pick up just the right amount of powdered bronzer and it&#x27;s very easy to blend the powder once it&#x27;s on the cheek.

This brush would also be good for cream products and would likely blend them just as easily.  I can&#x27;t believe I found such a nice brush for such a low price.  I like it so much, I&#x27;m going to order a second one.  The shipping took about three weeks, but it does come from Asia so that&#x27;s to be expected.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.  I paid about $5 for it and the quality makes it worth much more than that.  Thank heavens for Amazon!  I definitely recommend this contour brush.</li>
