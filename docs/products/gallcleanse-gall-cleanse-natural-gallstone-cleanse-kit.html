            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>I received this product within the promised delivery date and the product quality was good.</li>
            <li>I am very confident God gave me a Gall Bladder for a good reason and would prefer to keep it.</li>
            <li>OK, GallCleanse is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Great product, however it cost way too much!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure if over time it can cure though.  </li>
            <li>And I can see it is working by the color of my p...:-) .</li>
            <li>Therefore I did not give it a top rating.</li>
            <li>Used this for years great natural product</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Gall Cleanse as an alternative to surgery.</li>
            <li>and I am as good as new.  </li>
            <li>I took one course of these tablets and have been attack free ever since.</li>
            <li>My gall bladder is calm for many months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Like I said, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I did have to add a pro-biotic to my diet to help maintain my intestinal flora levels as the powerful mint gel cap can strip the flora from your intestinal track which causes bloating and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I have been attack free since mid May 2010 (had weekly attacks for 6 weeks prior to diagnosis) and have been able to say no to surgery...</li>
            <li>, they certainly will not dissolve gallstones.</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best thing anyone has tried to get me to take when dealing with this weird gallbladder problem.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about this product, as it has been demonstrated by clinical trials (ignored by the popular press) that most herbal products are useless ripoffs.  </li>
            <li>I became very underweight.</li>
            <li>As my pay it forward, I been very vocal about the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say thanks again.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works...</li>
            <li>do not want to have my gall bladder removed as it is very important, other than what some people say, to your digestion.</li>
            <li>Other oral medications are not as effective as GallCleanse Gall Cleanse Natural Gallstone Cleanse Kit.</li>
            <li>This product is very affordable comparing it to the high cost of cholecystectomy not to mention the pain a person will go through.</li>
            <li>The merchant was quick to take my money, but when I contacted this merchant in regards to returning the item for a refund, I never heard back.</li>
            <li>She was 78 years old then and the operation was really risky.</li>
            <li>cholecystectomy is done laparoscopically, so you spend only one night in the hospital, but who wants any surgery?!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how well it actually removes Gallstones, but it does take care of the pains caused by gallstones in the gall bladder.</li>
            <li>Or if you want to go the natural route, then I&#x27;d recommend \\&quot;Christopher&#x27;s Liver and Gallbladder</li>
            <li>No more pain, chills and I am free of worries.</li>
            <li>&quot; You&#x27;re better off with a doctor&#x27;s prescription of Ursodiol for dissolving gallstones less than 2 cm -- this typically takes anywhere from 6 to 18 months.</li>
            <li>I used to have severe gall bladder attacks; extreme pain, swelling, high fevers, vomiting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I used to have severe gall bladder attacks; extreme pain, swelling, high fevers, vomiting.  Over about a two year period I tried Bragg&#x27;s vinegar which helped but I still had to be careful of what and when I ate and had occasional but less severe attacks. I became very underweight. I eventually found and tried Gall Cleanse and have now been on it for over 7 years. It works! I am very confident God gave me a Gall Bladder for a good reason and would prefer to keep it. I have researched the effects and cost of removal and have learned that you are at risk of developing diabetes, will always have problems with fatty foods and may have to take medication if your gall bladder is removed. Plus Gall Cleanse is probably helping the other organs. I did have to add a pro-biotic to my diet to help maintain my intestinal flora levels as the powerful mint gel cap can strip the flora from your intestinal track which causes bloating and discomfort. I strongly recommend Gall Cleanse as an alternative to surgery.</li>
            <li> Twice now in recent years I have been striken with gallstones to the point of pain and be encouraged by my Doctor to have my gall bladder surgically removed.  A couple of weeks taking Gall Cleanse and I am as good as new.  The only reason it happened a second time was because I foolishly stopped taking the Gall Cleanse for over a year and the stones returned.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best thing anyone has tried to get me to take when dealing with this weird gallbladder problem. I have a slightly over active gallbladder that seems to cause as much of a train wreck as as a underactive one.  Also bloating and gassy IBS .  I would say instill notice that it hurts a little bit. But I would say this stuff base helped atleast 90 percent.</li>
            <li> I tried a month&#x27;s supply and no doubt the product did substantially reduce the gallbladder pain and possibly even the number of attacks.  Can&#x27;t say for sure if over time it can cure though.  Downside is the product is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this product, as it has been demonstrated by clinical trials (ignored by the popular press) that most herbal products are useless ripoffs.  But this one actually seems to work!  I was passing a gallstone fragment almost every day, at the cost of considerable pain that sometimes lasted for hours, but I have not had a serious problem since I started taking these products 3 weeks ago except minor flashes as debris passed.  I&#x27;m going to order it again to keep it on hand as a precaution.  Granted cholecystectomy is done laparoscopically, so you spend only one night in the hospital, but who wants any surgery?!</li>
            <li> I got these about 6 months ago after being diagnosed with gallstones. I was having weekly attacks. I took one course of these tablets and have been attack free ever since. I had no problems with difficulty digesting them or any other side effects. However, my doctor swears that its the changes to my diet (no red meat, minimal chicken and fish, no high fat foods, minimal cheese etc) that is keeping me attack free as opposed to the pills, but I felt better and much less paranoid whilst I was on them. They are pricey and I have not ordered another course as I i decided to test the doctors theory with diet alone, and hey presto.. I have been attack free since mid May 2010 (had weekly attacks for 6 weeks prior to diagnosis) and have been able to say no to surgery... for the time being at least.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me to find relief from the pains that I had from gall stones. I received this product within the promised delivery date and the product quality was good.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how well it actually removes Gallstones, but it does take care of the pains caused by gallstones in the gall bladder. I used it about 2 years ago and it worked then, so I&#x27;m using it again.&lt;br /&gt;Gallstones can be recurring and surgery does not prevent this, just lessens this. Gallcleanse requires no surgery to do its work. I did talk with my doctor about this.</li>
            <li> I was having horrible pain and after an ultrasound it was determined that I had numerous gall stones.  My doctor recommended surgery to remove my gall bladder, but I ordered GallCleanse and have not had another attack.  I&#x27;m on my second month of Gall Cleanse.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is suffering with gall stones.</li>
            <li> I had seen 3 gallstones on my ultrasound, I&#x27;ve tried this and they are still there on ultrasound the same still causing pain. Too high&lt;br /&gt;of a price to pay for no results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a week. So far so good. I had pain for over 7 weeks, went to the doctor, had Ultrasound done, I have gallstones. After I started to use this product, I have much less pain. And I can see it is working by the color of my p...:-) . I will leave other review after I will use this product at least a month. I drink plenty of water and apple juice, and I am really careful with what I eat also.Like I said, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Used this for years great natural product</li>
            <li> The merchant was quick to take my money, but when I contacted this merchant in regards to returning the item for a refund, I never heard back. I contacted them twice and allowed 3 business days to respond. I had to open my first Amazon A-Z dispute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merchant&#x27;s description of this expensive, \\&quot;magical\\&quot; product is very vague. He / she should have listed the herbal extracts included and the actual description on the bottles. It is highly unlikely that this product will deliver the miracle results as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While \\&quot;Mentha piperita (peppermint) extract, caraway oil extract, ginger oil, geranium oil, &amp; fennel seed oil\\&quot; may aid in digestion, they certainly will not dissolve gallstones. The second bottle included suggests to \\&quot;start taking capsules after 1 week of taking softgels,\\&quot; which claims to flush out the stones with extracts like Grape and \\&quot;Ginseng,\\&quot; a common ingredient found in energy drinks. Why pay $50 for something that \\&quot;has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration?\\&quot; You&#x27;re better off with a doctor&#x27;s prescription of Ursodiol for dissolving gallstones less than 2 cm -- this typically takes anywhere from 6 to 18 months. Or if you want to go the natural route, then I&#x27;d recommend \\&quot;Christopher&#x27;s Liver and Gallbladder Formula\\&quot; with similar ingredients like Fennel Seed, Ginger, Peppermint\\&quot; for less than 1/5 of the price!</li>
            <li> Anyone with recurring gallstones should have this product in their medicine cabinet.  Not only does it help eliminate the stones it also helps alleviate the pain.  A great product.</li>
            <li> I received this product without the packaging shown, just the bottles. There was no information on the bottles where this product is manufactured and I wasn&#x27;t going to ingest something without that information. So I didn&#x27;t try this product and can&#x27;t say how well it works. Even though I was allowed to returned this product, they deducted over 25% for restocking so just wanted to warn others who may be concerned on where this is manufactured so they can make an informed choice.</li>
            <li> Product looked different from the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t think it worked.&lt;br /&gt;So i decided to make Hulda clark liver flush. That one worked..!</li>
            <li> It works. Just fix your diet and never take this again or buy next year if you don&#x27;t like change what you eat</li>
            <li> Great product, however it cost way too much!  Therefore I did not give it a top rating.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done!</li>
            <li> OK, GallCleanse is a really good product. Anytime I have a gall bladder flare up,&lt;br /&gt;I just do a month or two of the GallCleanse and done! My gall bladder is calm for many months.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to have my gall bladder removed as it is very important, other than what some people say, to your digestion.</li>
            <li> My mother was operated two years ago due to gallstones. I saw how she suffered from the pain, discomfort and fever. She was 78 years old then and the operation was really risky. This product will be of big help to those suffering from the same illness. The liver is usually damaged especially in cases where in there is massive infection due to gallstone. I am speaking from experience because my fathersâ€™ liver was damaged due to gallstone. By using this product, such can be prevented. This product is very affordable comparing it to the high cost of cholecystectomy not to mention the pain a person will go through. Other oral medications are not as effective as GallCleanse Gall Cleanse Natural Gallstone Cleanse Kit. But when I tried this product and found the answer to my gallstone problem I need not undergo operation. Some people found this product expensive but I feel otherwise. Now, I feel no more pain and I have no second thoughts of recommending this to people who might have the same problem as mine. No more pain, chills and I am free of worries. I am so scared with undergoing surgery and have been delaying it since I was diagnosed with gallstones. My friend recommended this product to me and to my surprise.It worked. As my pay it forward, I been very vocal about the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say thanks again.</li>
            <li> Immediately relieved my abdominal pain. I&#x27;ll recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this formula! I only wish they&#x27;d sell individually--flush product and pre-treatment product</li>
