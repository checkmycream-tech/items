            <li>I use it on my hair, so I don&#x27;t mind the liquidy consistency, but if you are looking for something to use on skin, this is probably not the best.</li>

            <li>but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>I bought it to use for postpartum care and do not intend to drink it (as directions suggest), though I love the light, sweet smell and may give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle - just remember to refrigerate it after opening.</li>
            <li>Now I have a huge bottle that has to go in the garbage.</li>
            <li>great overall.</li>
            <li>Either the Gel or just plain Aloe juice, works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>It has been used as an antiseptic for cuts and burns, as well as a cool relief for sun burned skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong for me but its amazinggggg.</li>
            <li>I first heard of using aloe Vera juice from youtube, but not about drinking but for your hair!</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The gel is nice and thick while still being able to pour it out of the jar.</li>
            <li>I miss him very much.</li>
            <li>I also have to say I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I think that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>First off aloe vera has been used for thousands of years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to pull out for use without making a mess, but easy to mix/spread for what I&#x27;m needing it for.</li>
            <li>Lily of the desert is 98% pure and comes in liquid or gel form.</li>
            <li>I really like it, I use it as a toner and it works gret.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I saw &amp;#34;32 oz.&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t realize just how much I would be getting until it arrived today.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is one of my favorites</li>
            <li>I may slip it into a smoothie or two from time to time but either way, this is my new go-to aloe gel.</li>
            <li>I am still alive!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It seems like it might be the equivalent of drinking jello that is halfway between first being mixed and solidifcation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like something I&#x27;d want to ingest, but I&#x27;m hoping that occasional topical application (with a thorough rinsing) will be fine.</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy gel.</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair and it provides LIFE to my hair.</li>
            <li>Typically keep it in the fridge to stay fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it so far in my facial moisturizer concoction and to thicken up castor oil for my home-made hair-growth serum</li>

            <li> It is very pure and thick and keeps well in the fridge.</li>
            <li> The taste (like vinegar) is pretty hard to compensate for,</li>
            <li> It is thick like a gel, but smooths in more like a thick liquid when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated and it lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> I also add a little avocado oil to the spray for some extra moisturizing.</li>

            <li> and I take a few sips  </li>
            <li> I thought gel would be just the inner part of the leaf for external use and was deeply disappointed that it was watered down and recommended for drinking.</li>
            <li> (By the way, to use it as a moisturizer spritz for your hair, just put some in a little plastic spray bottle and use it to condition your hair whenever you want to add tons of moisture and vitamins to your hair!</li>
            <li> Hard to find too.</li>
            <li> gel is too thick prefer liquid</li>
            <li> Very unhealthy ingredient.</li>
            <li> I use it in my homemade shampoo, as a cold eye gel in the morning, and put it in my smoothies.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s bad...</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I do in fact put it in my hair every night!</li>

            <li> Great product, I used it in all of my body and hair mixture.  It also blend great will any product</li>
            <li> Good and unique produc. Hard to find too.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I use it as a toner and it works gret.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten the good stuff because at the top of the bottle was a tag certifying that it is food grade and it had ratings/comments from some aloe critics so that must be good, right? Comes in a brown bottle with a tamper-proof lid so I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve only used it so far in my facial moisturizer concoction and to thicken up castor oil for my home-made hair-growth serum but so far, so good! I may slip it into a smoothie or two from time to time but either way, this is my new go-to aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF! I use it on my skin and hair. Keeps my kinky-curly hair moisturized and keeps my skin glowing. One day,  I will work up the courage to actually consume it for it&#x27;s touted health benefits</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin after I take a shower and in my hair as a styling gel.  Works great and no greasy after effects.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent, prize is good and customer service is great.nI will order again and I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> gel is too thick prefer liquid</li>
            <li> This met all of my expectations and arrived quicly</li>
            <li> Large bottle for a great price.</li>
            <li> I thought gel would be just the inner part of the leaf for external use and was deeply disappointed that it was watered down and recommended for drinking. Being dubious since aloe can be toxic taken internally (said the retired RN with a Master&#x27;s in Holistic Health), I returned this product.</li>
            <li> My purpose for this is very specific. I use it diluted in water as a spray for my hair. I keep it refrigerated and it lasts for long time. This particular brand is one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I did not buy this because it has Carrageenan in it. Google it, it&#x27;s bad... Very unhealthy ingredient. I hope they change that. No corn citric acid either as in some other bottles.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a thinner consistency than I was expecting. I use it on my hair, so I don&#x27;t mind the liquidy consistency, but if you are looking for something to use on skin, this is probably not the best. I also have to say I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I think that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I first heard of using aloe Vera juice from youtube, but not about drinking but for your hair! It may sound crazy, wait I know it sounds crazy, but I do in fact put it in my hair every night! Why, you might ask? Well I&#x27;ll tell you! First off aloe vera has been used for thousands of years. It has been used as an antiseptic for cuts and burns, as well as a cool relief for sun burned skin. But wait, don&#x27;t stop reading just yet! Like I said I put it on my hair and when I do it adds the needed moisture that my hair craves and my hair feels softer after it dries. It&#x27;s also helping my hair grow which delights me to no end! Lily of the desert is 98% pure and comes in liquid or gel form. Now buy it and I will stop making your brain go into overdrive just  to read about it! (By the way, to use it as a moisturizer spritz for your hair, just put some in a little plastic spray bottle and use it to condition your hair whenever you want to add tons of moisture and vitamins to your hair! I also add a little avocado oil to the spray for some extra moisturizing.( And I&#x27;m sure you can get the avocado oil and spray bottle from Amazon! How, you might ask, do I know that? Because that&#x27;s where I bought mine from! Lol! SIDE NOTE: I bought the Lily of the Desert juice as well and got the reviews mixed up! You can still use the gel the same way you use the liquid, you just have to mix it with a little water!</li>
            <li> quality and value for this.</li>
            <li> If you have g.e.r.d., or if you are unfortunate enough to have developed a hiatal hernia this product is for you. Either the Gel or just plain Aloe juice, works wonderfully! I truly believe that this plant is a gift from God! It soothes and heals. I started using this because a friend, and I both were diagnosed with Barret&#x27;s Esophagitis around the same time. He, {tragically}, died from cancer of his Esophagus and Stomach. I am still alive! I miss him very much. I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Great!! absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This is the best! I use for my hair and skin and I take a few sips  right out of the bottle. This a great moisturizer for my face and hair. It softens my hair and hydrates my skin. Will purchase again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A great product. The only aloe product I have found to meet my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  Has Carrageenan.  Super bad for you.  I didn&#x27;t notice before I bought it.  Now I have a huge bottle that has to go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face after I cleanse and tone it, I keep it in the fridge and it&#x27;s refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I feel a difference when I do not take it.</li>
            <li> Rien &amp;agrave; redire comme tous les produits Lily of Desert.&lt;br /&gt;Le gel est assez &amp;eacute;pais et donc un peu difficile &amp;agrave; doser. Par contre il est excellent au gout</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as hair cleanser (I mix honey and aloe vera gel and use it instead of commercial shampoo) - found out about the Carrageenan used as a thickening agent after I bought it. Did some research and it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like something I&#x27;d want to ingest, but I&#x27;m hoping that occasional topical application (with a thorough rinsing) will be fine. Nice large bottle - just remember to refrigerate it after opening.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a bargain! I saw &amp;#34;32 oz.&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t realize just how much I would be getting until it arrived today. I bought it to use for postpartum care and do not intend to drink it (as directions suggest), though I love the light, sweet smell and may give it a try anyway. This is not a heavy gel. It is thick like a gel, but smooths in more like a thick liquid when applied to the skin. This makes it easy to pull out for use without making a mess, but easy to mix/spread for what I&#x27;m needing it for. It seems like it might be the equivalent of drinking jello that is halfway between first being mixed and solidifcation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty great overall. It offered some great cooling properties for my arm and hand that I used for testing purposes. I&#x27;m excited to try it out!</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it in my homemade shampoo, as a cold eye gel in the morning, and put it in my smoothies.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong for me but its amazinggggg. I use it on my natural hair and it provides LIFE to my hair. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great product!! arrived in a timely fashion, with no issues!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my skin rash. I did help an have not use for other issues. I will try on my hair. hope will do some good.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy and a great product. The gel is nice and thick while still being able to pour it out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and it is wonderful.  I love this product, but make sure you keep it refrigerated after opening.</li>
            <li> All expectations met.</li>
            <li> Use this as a moisturizer for my hair. Great product. Typically keep it in the fridge to stay fresh. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this as a nutritional supplement in my super-smoothies and for external applications (burns/beauty products). It is very pure and thick and keeps well in the fridge.</li>
            <li> The taste (like vinegar) is pretty hard to compensate for,</li>
