    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This device is great!</li>
            <li>The thermage machine, which I also bought it&#x27;s an excellent companion.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase .</li>
            <li>It is keeping my skin looking great !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this device.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this unit.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the seller was very nice and let me return it and get a replacement.</li>
            <li>They (dermatologists) say that for my age group, best results aren&#x27;t seen for 8 weeks or more (bummer).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 and looking for help with tone although I do have good skin and tone for my age.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for the $$.  </li>
            <li>If I could afford maybe I would use a unit that covers more space at one time - but that&#x27;s not a criticism of this product which is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I really love it and do believe it works!</li>
            <li>Very impressed by how fast I started seeing the results.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for great product!</li>
            <li>Customer service with NEW SPA is the best I have found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I asked mom who the hot chick was&amp;#34; Then they stated I looked great.</li>
            <li>and I can not see the scar any more.</li>
            <li>If the seller can improve that one glitch, I think they would have a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love this lil device.</li>
            <li>I feel and look better.</li>
            <li>I tried using a cream, but it dries and becomes lumpy, so oil works much better.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend; for the price I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.</li>
            <li>I spray some rose water to make it glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>Lol so far I cannot complain and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown so used to having pain in my hands - and the feeling that my fingers are becoming gnarly</li>
            <li>Does what it says---I&#x27;m happy so far with results.  </li>
            <li>but sure the results would be great with regular use.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something to help keep it in good conditiona and this seems to fit the bill so far.</li>
            <li>Works great... seeing instant results!</li>
            <li>I have been using light therapy for about a two months</li>
            <li>I used both the light and the bio-function for three days</li>
            <li>One of those rare cases when product exceeded all my expectations and worked bettter and faster than described. :-)</li>
            <li>Red light is very effective for antiaging-</li>
            <li>I barely use any concealer anymore and for the first time in years I feel I look great without my makeup.</li>
            <li>I am going through a lot of stress in my life right now, and I just found out I am suffering from adrenal fatigue!  </li>
            <li>Got this device a little over a month ago because of good reviews, thank you kind people out there who are willing to help others!</li>
            <li>Good solid product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE combining the red light with the microcurrent, and my skin looks better when I use it.</li>
            <li>It really works, love it.</li>
            <li>The motor stopped working quickly after I bought this.</li>
            <li>Besides, this is an awesome way to spend some quiet time alone doing something for me only!</li>
            <li>Despite the poor motor, this device is a BRILLIANT concept!</li>
            <li>Once finished, I rinse off the glycerine with warm water and depending on the night of the week I either use an exfoliating mask or go right to my toner followed by my humectant, then my eye gel and lastly my moisturizer in the evening and in the morning my moisturizer and sun block.</li>
            <li>After the success of using this on my hands, I started researching \\&quot;RED LIGHT THERAPY FOR PAIN RELIEF\\&quot; and found that many doctors, chiropractors, etc. are recommending Red Light Therapy for pain, healing of wounds, acne and some are using it to treat cancers.</li>
            <li>It feels like your face is getting a nice little workout and the red light has been documented to have many benefits.</li>
            <li>Sellers were very reasonable with me.</li>
            <li>Well - this little device has delivered the best results of anything so far, as far as relieving the pain goes.  </li>
            <li>and I used it twice a day the first month.</li>
            <li>At first, it felt as though my skin was tightening.</li>
            <li>I can see the affects of this machine has on my face within a short period of time and it can only get better and better with time.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that many other factors will have the aging effect on us humans; hydration level (i&#x27;ve been an unintentionally dehydrated person most of my life), the degree of quality nutrition, sleep, excersize and the big one; one&#x27;s genetic makeup.</li>
            <li>However this little piece if plastic has helped me to look better!</li>
            <li>I have one area on my index finger of my right hand that is still a bit sore -- but every other part - especially the pad of my thumbs - called the THENAR - has become mostly pain free.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine but lasted a short time.</li>
            <li>BUT IT ALL SO HAS THAT RED LIGHT FOR LINES AND SPOTS</li>
            <li>There are a lot of scientific papers written on the benefits of Red Light Therapy.</li>
            <li>Reasonable result.</li>
            <li>It is relaxing when you turn the red light up to 5.</li>
            <li>Red light and microcurrent.</li>
            <li>This is why I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and see how much improvement I can get out of it.</li>
            <li>I find it very relaxing.</li>
            <li>However for the red light I have been using it morning and night</li>
            <li>I wish it went to 10 because I have high pain tolerance!</li>
            <li>I have not received the chart on how to use it properly, so I have just been youtubing videos to similar products and just creating my own way to use it.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it calms my (tendency to redness) face down and that generally my face is looking good.  </li>
            <li>so this is very economical for the same results.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you have titanium in your mouth instead of other metals in your teeth, non-conductors!</li>
            <li>The fine lines are gone and the wrinkles are now fine lines, also the acne scarring from my teenage years has improved as have the dark under eye cicles.</li>
            <li>But after only 3 days of using this on my hands, fingers, and especially on my wrists, MY HANDS ARE 90% PAIN FREE!  </li>
            <li>Overall red light takes the day, now I just need to do it in my neck!</li>
            <li>The probes actually DO get a little warm but not uncomfortable and there is no pain.</li>
            <li>I am looking like I have high cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>interesting little gadget; does it do what it claims?</li>
            <li>You can never do too much or start to early to keep looking 18 for the next 20 years ;)</li>
            <li>I am already seeing my sun spots fade slowly and my skin becoming smoother with the Red Light therapy.  </li>
            <li>Nice skin is time consuming so get used to spending a little extra on cleaning, exfoliating, toning, moisturizing, etc</li>
            <li>-- that I&#x27;ve just learned to live with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things to help with this debilitating problem, which is extremely painful: I&#x27;ve given up gluten, which helped immensely, bought a cold laser ($5000) -- which has also been a great benefit - had Thai massage, also great help and use Penetrex (which you can buy on Amazon) twice a day.</li>
            <li>and I looked and felt old!  </li>
            <li>If you do a little research via google - it&#x27;s easy to find.  </li>
            <li>I do use setting of  10, but I have high pain tolerance, so I barely feel it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LITTLE MESSAGER, NOT ONLY</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because it is a pain when it shuts off so frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if I have any help with my face - which isn&#x27;t very wrinkly, but I&#x27;m starting to see things sagging.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE JOINT PAIN - TRY IT!e any help with my face - which isn&#x27;t very wrinkly, but I&#x27;m starting to see things sagging.  </li>
            <li>I wake early and use it in bed while I&#x27;m hitting the snooze button for about 20-30 minutes - it&#x27;s relaxing used that way.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do use this product and frequently as I should</li>
            <li>I only use bio-level 3, because the prickling was too intense for me at level 4, and I didn&#x27;t even try level 5.</li>
            <li>I bought this after doing a little research and discovered that Red Light Therapy was &#x27;discovered&#x27; by NASA.</li>
            <li>This little device made my skin look smooth and 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>I absolutely see a difference in the tightness of my facial muscles and the overall improvement of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked wonders and I will continue to use it for the next 4 months before I give it a break!</li>
            <li>If you want to loose a few wrinkles, fine lines, scars, etc.... give this a try, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised how this little hand held unit really works.</li>

            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised how this little hand held unit really works.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it is not a once and done thing; Like all muscle toning devices, they only work as long as one uses them.</li>
            <li> The red light was just blinding, so again uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a gentle cream cleanser, then I use a thin coat of pure glycerine on my face and neck down to the decollete and turn on the Spa device and begin the massage.</li>
            <li> I thought that was hard to believe and expected the pain to come back - but as long as I use it at least once a day on my hands -- the pain is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li> I use it with aloe Vera get and when it starts to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m approaching 6 months with the second device and the motor &amp;#34;growls&amp;#34; and slows down even if I only run it a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My cheeks started to hollow out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not large</li>
            <li> I have been using this little miracle for approximately 3 weeks now every other day for 10 minutes on my forehead and eye areas then another 10 on the lower half of my face and today is the actual day that I finally looked in the mirror and thought wow!</li>
            <li> Overall face skin smooths evens out with using of this massager, small wrinkles go away.</li>
            <li> my face is tight, compared to my neck where I haven&#x27;t used it at all.</li>

            <li> The package arrived in a timely manner and I used it twice a day the first month. I did see a glow on my skin and possibly some fullness of the cheek area. The device does shut off a lot and it takes several times to push the on button to get it to turn on. I used it on a spot that I had surgery on February 9th 2014 and I can not see the scar any more. Despite the always turning off I continue to use it every day. Maybe missing four days since I purchased. I visited a family member in September 2014 and again yesterday 4/8/2015. When I knocked at their door they said &amp;#34;oh its Terri I asked mom who the hot chick was&amp;#34; Then they stated I looked great. So I guess the device works. I gave four stars because it is a pain when it shuts off so frequently.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LITTLE MESSAGER, NOT ONLY DOES IT PULSATE TO GIVE YOUR FACE MUSCLES A WORK OUT BUT IT ALL SO HAS THAT RED LIGHT FOR LINES AND SPOTS</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing a little research and discovered that Red Light Therapy was &#x27;discovered&#x27; by NASA. There are a lot of scientific papers written on the benefits of Red Light Therapy. If you do a little research via google - it&#x27;s easy to find.  So, I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, twice and sometimes three times a day.  As I&#x27;m over 50, I&#x27;ve not seen any change on my face as yet. They (dermatologists) say that for my age group, best results aren&#x27;t seen for 8 weeks or more (bummer). BUT for some reason, I was compelled to try this on on my hands for a severe case of carpal tunnel that I&#x27;ve been suffering with for 4 years. I&#x27;ve tried many things to help with this debilitating problem, which is extremely painful: I&#x27;ve given up gluten, which helped immensely, bought a cold laser ($5000) -- which has also been a great benefit - had Thai massage, also great help and use Penetrex (which you can buy on Amazon) twice a day. I&#x27;m a musician and need my hands to work. Well - this little device has delivered the best results of anything so far, as far as relieving the pain goes.  I&#x27;ve grown so used to having pain in my hands - and the feeling that my fingers are becoming gnarly -- that I&#x27;ve just learned to live with it.  But after only 3 days of using this on my hands, fingers, and especially on my wrists, MY HANDS ARE 90% PAIN FREE!  After the success of using this on my hands, I started researching \\&quot;RED LIGHT THERAPY FOR PAIN RELIEF\\&quot; and found that many doctors, chiropractors, etc. are recommending Red Light Therapy for pain, healing of wounds, acne and some are using it to treat cancers. I thought that was hard to believe and expected the pain to come back - but as long as I use it at least once a day on my hands -- the pain is mostly gone.  I have one area on my index finger of my right hand that is still a bit sore -- but every other part - especially the pad of my thumbs - called the THENAR - has become mostly pain free.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if I have any help with my face - which isn&#x27;t very wrinkly, but I&#x27;m starting to see things sagging.  SO I will update in two months. IF YOU HAVE JOINT PAIN - TRY IT!e any help with my face - which isn&#x27;t very wrinkly, but I&#x27;m starting to see things sagging.  SO I will update in two months. IF YOU HAVE JOINT PAIN - TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month.  I can tell that it calms my (tendency to redness) face down and that generally my face is looking good.  I&#x27;m 66 and looking for help with tone although I do have good skin and tone for my age.  It&#x27;s not large so you have to just relax and take some time with it - I wake early and use it in bed while I&#x27;m hitting the snooze button for about 20-30 minutes - it&#x27;s relaxing used that way.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  If I could afford maybe I would use a unit that covers more space at one time - but that&#x27;s not a criticism of this product which is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Good solid product. Reasonable result.</li>
            <li> The motor stopped working quickly after I bought this. Thankfully, the seller was very nice and let me return it and get a replacement. They guarantee it for 6 months. I&#x27;m approaching 6 months with the second device and the motor &amp;#34;growls&amp;#34; and slows down even if I only run it a few minutes. I&#x27;m guessing it will stop working soon, but I&#x27;ll probably be past the 6 months. Despite the poor motor, this device is a BRILLIANT concept! I LOVE combining the red light with the microcurrent, and my skin looks better when I use it. I try to not use it too often though because I&#x27;m trying to preserve the sluggish motor. If the seller can improve that one glitch, I think they would have a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This device is great! I have been using it for over two months and definitely see improvements in my skin! It works against wrinkles, makes skin tighter and looking healthier. The only downfall of this device is its buttons, they are a bit tricky to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in browline wrinkles - flattens and smooths out forehead.</li>
            <li> Have used for one month, everyday and still using it. At first, it felt as though my skin was tightening. It is relaxing when you turn the red light up to 5. I do not use the microcurrent on this product as I use a separate one. I will continue for a second month in hopes to see skin discoloration improve as well as jowl line lift. It does appear that frown line between the eyes has eased somewhat..</li>
            <li> This machine gives two treatments in one. Red light and microcurrent. Red light is very effective for antiaging- my face is tight, compared to my neck where I haven&#x27;t used it at all. Microcurrent can hurt, as you can feel the electricity all the way up to your head, like I did. This is why I don&#x27;t use it much. I do use lower intensity and this is a plus for keeping this machine. Also, make sure you have titanium in your mouth instead of other metals in your teeth, non-conductors! Overall red light takes the day, now I just need to do it in my neck! The thermage machine, which I also bought it&#x27;s an excellent companion.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for it. I knew it would be hard to find time to do it but it was very uncomfortable as you really can&#x27;t  tell from the the picture but the pins are sticking out. So really uncomfortable to use. Had to have lots of gel. The red light was just blinding, so again uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li> No idea.... bought this for my wife and she used it 2 times. Not actually sure it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this little miracle for approximately 3 weeks now every other day for 10 minutes on my forehead and eye areas then another 10 on the lower half of my face and today is the actual day that I finally looked in the mirror and thought wow! I&#x27;m actually getting some of that cheeky cuteness back that u had about me 10 years ago! I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and see how much improvement I can get out of it. It just takes patience as it doesn&#x27;t work after one 10 minute treatment but it does work!</li>
            <li> This product is good for the $$.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do use this product and frequently as I should but sure the results would be great with regular use.</li>
            <li> Works great... seeing instant results!</li>
            <li> interesting little gadget; does it do what it claims? YES. Keep in mind that many other factors will have the aging effect on us humans; hydration level (i&#x27;ve been an unintentionally dehydrated person most of my life), the degree of quality nutrition, sleep, excersize and the big one; one&#x27;s genetic makeup. So, if you want to aid your youthful appearance, this device will help, no question. I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my face, I&#x27;m 52.</li>
            <li> I love this lil device. I have been using light therapy for about a two months the difference in my skin is unbelievable. The fine lines are gone and the wrinkles are now fine lines, also the acne scarring from my teenage years has improved as have the dark under eye cicles. I barely use any concealer anymore and for the first time in years I feel I look great without my makeup. I bought this device because it had the added microcurrent feature. I can feel the electrical pulses as Im using it and you can adjust the strength of them. When I ordered this I was shipped the wrong item, I notified the company and within days I had the one I ordered. Customer service with NEW SPA is the best I have found on Amazon. If you want to loose a few wrinkles, fine lines, scars, etc.... give this a try, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Worked fine but lasted a short time. Sellers were very reasonable with me.</li>
            <li> Does what it says---I&#x27;m happy so far with results.  It did not include diagram of how to use on the face.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase . It is keeping my skin looking great ! It feels like getting a facial.</li>
            <li> Very impressed by how fast I started seeing the results. From personal experience I know that it takes 2-3 weeks before you can expect to see the difference. I used both the light and the bio-function for three days and I could both feel and see the difference. The redness and some local skin inflammation is gone within 24 hours. Some pigmentation is noticeably lighter. Skin feels and look tighter. I only use bio-level 3, because the prickling was too intense for me at level 4, and I didn&#x27;t even try level 5. One photo/bio session in the morning, one at night. Three days - and voila! I feel and look better. One of those rare cases when product exceeded all my expectations and worked bettter and faster than described. :-)</li>
            <li> Got this device a little over a month ago because of good reviews, thank you kind people out there who are willing to help others! I really love it and do believe it works! I use it with some jojoba oil that I bought at Trader Joe&#x27;s. I tried using a cream, but it dries and becomes lumpy, so oil works much better. Overall face skin smooths evens out with using of this massager, small wrinkles go away. Besides, this is an awesome way to spend some quiet time alone doing something for me only! I find it very relaxing. I do use setting of  10, but I have high pain tolerance, so I barely feel it. Thank you so much for great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this little device twice a day every day for little over a week now; wIll be cutting back to once a day shortly. I absolutely see a difference in the tightness of my facial muscles and the overall improvement of my skin tone. The device has a pre-set timere so no overdoing it. The probes actually DO get a little warm but not uncomfortable and there is no pain. All that said I do not believe it is a miracle machine. You do need to watch your diet and overall skin regimine. This has added an additonal 10- 12 minutes to my morning and evening routine so if you are looking for faster, this is not your answer. Nice skin is time consuming so get used to spending a little extra on cleaning, exfoliating, toning, moisturizing, etc... Although fairly dry, my skin was not in bad shape for being just shy of 50 to begin with so I was looking for something to help keep it in good conditiona and this seems to fit the bill so far. I wash my face with a gentle cream cleanser, then I use a thin coat of pure glycerine on my face and neck down to the decollete and turn on the Spa device and begin the massage. The glycerine helps the device to glide seemlessly over the skin and does not dty out. Once finished, I rinse off the glycerine with warm water and depending on the night of the week I either use an exfoliating mask or go right to my toner followed by my humectant, then my eye gel and lastly my moisturizer in the evening and in the morning my moisturizer and sun block. I definately recommend; for the price I don&#x27;t think you can do any better. Lastly, it is not a once and done thing; Like all muscle toning devices, they only work as long as one uses them. Once you stop the benefits will also stop.</li>
            <li> It really works, love it.</li>
            <li> I am going through a lot of stress in my life right now, and I just found out I am suffering from adrenal fatigue!  Which is why I had hyperpigmentation as well as acne problems.  My cheeks started to hollow out and I looked and felt old!  However this little piece if plastic has helped me to look better! I have only been using it sparingly about 3x a week for the microcurrent.  However for the red light I have been using it morning and night and I have seen an evening out of my skin.  I also feel like it is tighter my skin.  Also it has helped me with dryness.  I use it with aloe Vera get and when it starts to dry I spray some rose water to make it glide smoothly. I have not received the chart on how to use it properly, so I have just been youtubing videos to similar products and just creating my own way to use it. So far it has worked wonders and I will continue to use it for the next 4 months before I give it a break! Lol so far I cannot complain and I am satisfied with my purchase. One thing is the microcurrent setting it doesn&#x27;t go beyond 5, I have read others reviews and they mentioned it goes to 10?! I wish it went to 10 because I have high pain tolerance! Try this and you will see results but don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> It feels like your face is getting a nice little workout and the red light has been documented to have many benefits. You can never do too much or start to early to keep looking 18 for the next 20 years ;)</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m impressed with this device.  I use my nightly skin lotion so skin doesn&#x27;t tug.</li>
            <li> This little device made my skin look smooth and 5 years younger. I used to go to a salon to have this done so this is very economical for the same results.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this unit. I am already seeing my sun spots fade slowly and my skin becoming smoother with the Red Light therapy.  The micro current  face massage is slowly lifting my sagging jowls and  I am looking like I have high cheekbones.  I can see the affects of this machine has on my face within a short period of time and it can only get better and better with time. I am very pleasantly surprised how this little hand held unit really works. Beyond my expectations. Hope it has a lengthy life time.</li>
