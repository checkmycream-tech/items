            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>how beautiful it looked.</li>
            <li>For me, it worked great because my hair was already bleached.</li>
            <li>they are happy</li>
            <li>Smells great, color lasts and doesn&#x27;t bleed</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>But smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing seller!</li>
            <li>Works amazing for me.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s awesome about this color is it really lasts.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was OK with that though.</li>
            <li>Always order from here, absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>A perfect ariel red.</li>
            <li>which is better for most skin types.</li>
            <li>This is the best red ever.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to mix this product with anything, I can apply directly to my hair, and it lasts a good amount of time!</li>
            <li>I really liked Special Effects in Cherry Bomb</li>
            <li>First the good--</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>when my red hair fades it puts bright nice color back in and it lasts longer will be purchasing a lot more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair bright red for about 2 yrs now.</li>
            <li>The color stays bright, but does bleed out some, especially with damp</li>
            <li>This will rub off some on your clothes and towels, but not nearly as bad as most semi-permanent dyes, and the vinegar rinse really helps to prevent that, too.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful wouldn&#x27;t use any other color !</li>
            <li>have to bleach first, and I do a touch-up a couple days after dying, to re-saturate any light or missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this, I think will be my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It worked great on her previously treated hair.</li>
            <li>I used 1.5 tubes after I used loreal hicolor in red with 30 vol developer &amp; the color turned out amazing.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s actually Joico, which is nice for us ppl who dont have COS licenses</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The red is amazing and very vibrant.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant!</li>
            <li>so if it is that way, it won&#x27;t catch the color which is why I recommend you bleach it first, like I mentioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinse with vinegar after first rinse and after every shampoo to help keep color locked in.</li>
            <li>And left my hair in BETTER condition than it started in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I did have to process my roots with another color first and had no issue after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cooler red for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more tubes of this.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Smells great and color last a long time even while washing or co-washing my hair every week</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a beautiful red and it lasts.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is thick and is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; it last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>know, red fades VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Sleep on an old pillowcase,use old towels when bathing, and don&#x27;t wear light colors for a day or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this color!&lt;br /&gt;Bright, vibrant, and doesn&#x27;t fade easily (as we all know reds do!)&lt;br /&gt;Strange for a semi to be put in dry hair, also strange to not have to use developer..</li>
            <li>But I put this red on &amp; left it in for 2 1/2 hours &amp; it softened it up &amp; left me with the most amazing red color!!</li>
            <li>I made 3 attempts at bright red, all lasted less then a week.</li>
            <li>Long lasting bright red!</li>
            <li>will say that my daughter has very dark hair and it gave her more of a purple hue to her hair than it did red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product and last long and stay vicolor</li>
            <li>color did not adhere to her new growth.</li>
            <li>no mention is made on the box that you need to pre-lighten/color treat new growth/roots.</li>
            <li>I have tried several, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t bleed or fade right away from a shampoo or simply rinsing with water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on week two, washed it twice so far &amp; the color is extremely vibrant still.</li>
            <li>In comparison to manic panic, it definitely fades nicely, more pink based rather than orange based.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind unless you have blonde hair you will have to bleach your hair out first.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that is a true red and lasts!</li>
            <li>The red was rich and vibrant, even on my natural black hair.</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s a true red and doesn&#x27;t fade to pink or orange.</li>
            <li>No pink, purple, or orange tones!</li>
            <li>No other dye has done that before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard on your hair though so be sure to use a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>As as experiment, we tried again a few days later on just the new growth, without success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was on schedule and even earlier than expected, I would certainly purchase from this seller again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful when applying because it will stain everything it comes in contact with (except new growth, see below).</li>

            <li> Came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE ONLY NEGATIVE; this color did not stick to virgin hair (my roots)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I went back to dark brown because my roots came in &amp; the red dye alone would not cover them</li>
            <li> not cool.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 tubes to cover my thick medium to long hair AND my 22 inch extensions.</li>
            <li> It lasted 4 weeks with little fading.</li>
            <li> I feel like the little mermaid.</li>
            <li> I used the least harsh bleach I could find tho my hair did fry alittle, I was dark brown.</li>
            <li> Well if your hair is like mine, I had really dark and still have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Sadly I had already dyed it back to brown.</li>
            <li> color leaks everywhere for a least a month</li>
            <li> I washed my hair in cold water &amp; also added a tiny dab of the dye to my shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> bad--</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me, it worked great because my hair was already bleached. So if your hair isn&#x27;t already bleached, or isn&#x27;t in the lighter tone, I don&#x27;t recommend this because it won&#x27;t stick to your hair... Well if your hair is like mine, I had really dark and still have really thick hair so if it is that way, it won&#x27;t catch the color which is why I recommend you bleach it first, like I mentioned. Other than that, it is a beautiful red and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Long lasting bright red! This is the longest lasting hair color I&#x27;ve come across. It&#x27;s very hard on your hair though so be sure to use a leave in conditioner. I prefer Schwarzkopf&#x27;s Blondme Shine Magnifying Spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; it last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my daughter has very dark hair and it gave her more of a purple hue to her hair than it did red.&lt;br /&gt;She was OK with that though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the longest lasting red I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I use a semi in between root touch ups to brighten up the rest of my hair.  I have tried several, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t bleed or fade right away from a shampoo or simply rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> This is the only red I will use. It is the only one that is a true red and lasts! No pink, purple, or orange tones! Very vibrant! I constantly get compliments on this color and people asking me what I use because they or someone they know can&#x27;t find a red they are happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to bleach first, and I do a touch-up a couple days after dying, to re-saturate any light or missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with vinegar after first rinse and after every shampoo to help keep color locked in. This will rub off some on your clothes and towels, but not nearly as bad as most semi-permanent dyes, and the vinegar rinse really helps to prevent that, too.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Smells great, color lasts and doesn&#x27;t bleed</li>
            <li> color leaks everywhere for a least a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair bright red for about 2 yrs now. I really liked Special Effects in Cherry Bomb but this, I think will be my new favorite. I like how it&#x27;s a true red and doesn&#x27;t fade to pink or orange. I was dying my hair every 2 weeks because of the fading but I&#x27;m at one week with this color now and it hasn&#x27;t even started to fade. The downside: more expensive and harder to find (in my experience).</li>
            <li> Always order from here, absolutely love this color. Works amazing for me.  I always get the best compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I made 3 attempts at bright red, all lasted less then a week. Until I used this product!! Keep in mind unless you have blonde hair you will have to bleach your hair out first. I used the least harsh bleach I could find tho my hair did fry alittle, I was dark brown. But I put this red on &amp; left it in for 2 1/2 hours &amp; it softened it up &amp; left me with the most amazing red color!! Exactly what I was looking for!! It lasted 4 weeks with little fading. I washed my hair in cold water &amp; also added a tiny dab of the dye to my shampoo &amp; conditioner. Unfortunately I went back to dark brown because my roots came in &amp; the red dye alone would not cover them, I found out from a hairdresser after that I could just bleach out my roots then use the red on them. Sadly I had already dyed it back to brown. I will wait a few mths then rebleach my hair &amp; will definitely be using this red again!! I also got the red clip in extensions &amp; OMG how beautiful it looked. I want it back, I miss it!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend. She&#x27;s been looking for a different red than the Manic Panic she was using. First the good--The red is amazing and very vibrant. Be careful when applying because it will stain everything it comes in contact with (except new growth, see below). We had to bleach the shower stall after rinsing to get the stain out. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The bad-- Sleep on an old pillowcase,use old towels when bathing, and don&#x27;t wear light colors for a day or so. The color stays bright, but does bleed out some, especially with damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color did not adhere to her new growth. no mention is made on the box that you need to pre-lighten/color treat new growth/roots. It worked great on her previously treated hair. As as experiment, we tried again a few days later on just the new growth, without success. It did stain her scalp, but did not color her hair. No other dye has done that before. his is why we give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color!&lt;br /&gt;Bright, vibrant, and doesn&#x27;t fade easily (as we all know reds do!)&lt;br /&gt;Strange for a semi to be put in dry hair, also strange to not have to use developer.. The texture is a little different in comparison to regular color. But smells amazing! And left my hair in BETTER condition than it started in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY NEGATIVE; this color did not stick to virgin hair (my roots) so I did have to process my roots with another color first and had no issue after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got here a week prior to delivery date.</li>
            <li> the color as a semi perm bleeds, it bleeds everywhere. I was in the gym and my sweat looked like blood running from my head, my pillows are permanently stained with the ting of red/pink. not cool. I would buy the Joico again but only in a permanent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on schedule and even earlier than expected, I would certainly purchase from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEE this color. I used 1.5 tubes after I used loreal hicolor in red with 30 vol developer &amp; the color turned out amazing. A perfect ariel red. What&#x27;s awesome about this color is it really lasts. I waited to do a review once I&#x27;ve had it for over a week or two. I&#x27;m going on week two, washed it twice so far &amp; the color is extremely vibrant still. In comparison to manic panic, it definitely fades nicely, more pink based rather than orange based. A cooler red for sure which is better for most skin types. It smells pretty good too. I bought 4 tubes to cover my thick medium to long hair AND my 22 inch extensions. I still have one tube left. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more tubes of this.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected. And it&#x27;s actually Joico, which is nice for us ppl who dont have COS licenses</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product again. The red was rich and vibrant, even on my natural black hair. And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This is the best red ever. I feel like the little mermaid. I leave it in for like 6 hours before rinsing. It lasts for months. Literally. It smells good and is thick and is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The best semi-permanent hair color out there! I will never use another brand!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this product and last long and stay vicolor The color is beautiful wouldn&#x27;t use any other color !</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I have Fire Red hair &amp; as well all know, red fades VERY quickly. I love that I don&#x27;t have to mix this product with anything, I can apply directly to my hair, and it lasts a good amount of time!</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product when my red hair fades it puts bright nice color back in and it lasts longer will be purchasing a lot more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Smells great and color last a long time even while washing or co-washing my hair every week</li>
