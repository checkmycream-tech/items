            <li> I purchased my filters from this company instead of an other company because the picture showed a CLEAR case for the filter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed the one I recieved was solid color &amp; not see through like the first one I ordered.</li>
            <li> Received filters within just a few days.</li>
            <li> Well made and has a clear body so you can get an idea of how dirty the filter is and when it might need replacing.  </li>
            <li> Buying it on Amazon is significantly less expensive than taking it to a DME for servicing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I found that they had sent my filters with the solid gray case.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to impossible to know when to change it.</li>

            <li> Just what I needed and the service was good and quick</li>
            <li> This filter fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Respironics Everflo is billed as being maintenance free. This does not include the fact that the filter does need to be changed every so often. Buying it on Amazon is significantly less expensive than taking it to a DME for servicing.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the filters are not in a clear case, so there is no way to visibly inspect the filter to see if it needs changing. This leads to more frequent replacement. But at the price it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get these quickly from Amazon because our supplier is always back ordered!  These are perfect and I love that they are clear so that you can check the filter.</li>

            <li> I purchased my filters from this company instead of an other company because the picture showed a CLEAR case for the filter.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a clear case. I was disappointed when I found that they had sent my filters with the solid gray case. I guess that is what you get when you can&#x27;t talk to a salesperson.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, and will be using it to replace my original filter. very simple to change once you see the actual equipment.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good deal.</li>
            <li> great service and price</li>
