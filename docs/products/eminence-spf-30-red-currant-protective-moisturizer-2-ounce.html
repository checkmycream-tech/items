            <li>Perfect for day moisturizer....</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li>Using it twice per day in winter has been perfectly sufficient.</li>
            <li>This is the best day moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Truly this is a beautiful wonderful product line!</li>
            <li>AWESOME product, great service</li>
            <li>Smells great and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great product for daytime.</li>
            <li>great, went on lightly.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>Great product and feels good going on and doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen</li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin and is packed with effective ingredients that synergistically work well together, not to mention  this cream smells great which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>and I needed a good moisturizer for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good condition until I opened up the box and the moisturizer had leaked out and hardened on the inside of the box.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and light day cream that is perfect with makeup.</li>
            <li>Plus it feels absolutely amazing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I have found that this particular face moisturizer works best for my skin.</li>
            <li>suitable for oily skin</li>
            <li>and I have very fine eyebrow hair</li>
            <li>I love a good light moisturizer that has SPF and doesn&#x27;t end up feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love this line of products.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to react to Eminence products, either.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>She is very happy with this product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite day cream.</li>
            <li>a bummer that my skin was allergic to it, but I was able to do a refund.</li>
            <li>This item has a light weight to it and it&#x27;s nice that there is a SPF, too.</li>
            <li>but I would say that it&#x27;s more medium.</li>
            <li>and I love this product line</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite from this company, but it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>The scent is light and it&#x27;s been working well to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>Overall, however, it&#x27;s a great product for someone with combination and/ or oily skin.</li>
            <li>so I like how this is a cream that blends out to a light finish.</li>
            <li>This left me with a glow and great moisture.</li>
            <li>It is described as a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>I wanted a moisturizer that had SPF, went on smooth, and wouldn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and this totally fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>and I tend to break out occasionally and so far my skin has been looking wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Great protection without looking pale like many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I have a problematic skin and can&#x27;t use anything that&#x27;s too heavy, so this is a very good find for me.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s an AMAZING and NATURAL product.</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;cheeeeeese\\&quot; quickly rub out the smile lines you just created... but first thing in the morning?</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>One was too much, the other was great with moisture but also providing oil control, but that sometimes was too much (and also wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Light and not heavy.</li>
            <li>I first started buying this at the spa</li>
            <li>I really like how this feels on my skin, plus it&#x27;s 30 SPF!</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve started to notice fine lines and wrinkles, my pores started to enlarge and fill up with dirt (black heads) and sunspots have been coming up more and more (even though I&#x27;ve been avoiding the sun).  </li>
            <li>Love the entire Eminence line of skin care.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s a bit more cooler outside my skin feels on the drier side.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer especially the texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more of the Red Currant products.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the fact that it&#x27;s half the price on Amazon makes it even better!</li>
            <li>For instance, I used to use the Tropical Vanilla Day Cream which is very moisturizing and nice, but with this Red Currant Moisturizer I feel I get the adequate amount of moisture without having excess shine/oil later in the day</li>
            <li>I used to have more acne prone skin with a combination of being dry.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;What happened here?\\&quot; as I looked at my spiky eyebrows that were prepped and ready for war...</li>
            <li>Thanks Eminence.</li>
            <li>My only problem is it&#x27;s a bit too light.</li>
            <li>I tried everything to get this stuff to be more moisturizing and less waxy.</li>
            <li>I found the price was more affordable at about $20 less.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have combination skin (oily t zone), starting to show the very first signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Really liking this so far.</li>
            <li>I use the Eminence Red Currant Moisturizer on my whole face, and on the areas that are the most sensitive and dry (around my mouth and nose) I apply the Eminence Tropical Vanilla Day Cream.  </li>
            <li>product is a must-buy if you have acne prone skin, or if you live in a humid environment.  </li>
            <li>I mean we all know what it&#x27;s like to smile with a pound of make up on for some special event like being a bridesmaid or whatever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not break out prone or really that sensitive, but this stuff made my skin question everything it knew about itself, took me a week to bounce back.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think its old</li>
            <li>I already had two different ones from another product line, but wasn&#x27;t finding that they really met my needs.  </li>
            <li>Did not agree with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It feels kind of thick going on, so you really only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Red Current Balancing Concentrate for quite some time, and was finding that I really needed a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate, I might try something different.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try it.  </li>
            <li> sometimes oily, sometimes dry.  </li>
            <li> This can sometimes leave your skin dry, flaky, and almost chapped.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that is also a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> (like I did using other Eminence products or other brands in general).</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Would b careful.</li>
            <li> It was very loose</li>
            <li> I finally spent the $ and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I have used some of their other products</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without being even slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li> Again, I do not use it everyday or everynight.  </li>
            <li> If you let it sink in for a few minutes before applying makeup, you can feel a cooling/tightening sensation.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive to lose any product.</li>
            <li> I truly hate that place, sigh.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great protection without looking pale like many sunscreens. Light and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products. This is a nice and light day cream that is perfect with makeup. The added perk is the sunscreen that we all need no matter what your age.</li>
            <li> I first started buying this at the spa I get services done - it&#x27;s an AMAZING and NATURAL product. Highly recommend it. Plus, the fact that it&#x27;s half the price on Amazon makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I like almost every product I purchased from Eminence but their sunscreens! They just pill off my face no matter what! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my skin, plus it&#x27;s 30 SPF! It feels kind of thick going on, so you really only need a tiny bit. The scent is light and it&#x27;s been working well to keep my skin moisturized. It works well under my powder foundation. I love how my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to react to Eminence products, either. I have sensitive skin and I tend to break out occasionally and so far my skin has been looking wonderful! The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite from this company, but it&#x27;s light so it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I love a good light moisturizer that has SPF and doesn&#x27;t end up feeling greasy.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination...sometimes oily, sometimes dry.  Recently, I&#x27;ve started to notice fine lines and wrinkles, my pores started to enlarge and fill up with dirt (black heads) and sunspots have been coming up more and more (even though I&#x27;ve been avoiding the sun).  So I started a Tretinoin (Retin-A) regimen.  This can sometimes leave your skin dry, flaky, and almost chapped.  I use the Eminence Red Currant Moisturizer on my whole face, and on the areas that are the most sensitive and dry (around my mouth and nose) I apply the Eminence Tropical Vanilla Day Cream.  It works wonders without making my skin overly oily at all.  Thank goodness for this or I&#x27;d be looking like a big flake-ball at work....embarrassing!</li>
            <li> This was ;a gift for my daughter.  She is very happy with this product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product, great service</li>
            <li> Product seems thicker than the one i had.  I think its old but it was the cheapest i could find.</li>
            <li> Great product and feels good going on and doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen</li>
            <li> Again, another wonderful Eminence product!  I had been using the Red Current Balancing Concentrate for quite some time, and was finding that I really needed a moisturizer.  I already had two different ones from another product line, but wasn&#x27;t finding that they really met my needs.  One was too much, the other was great with moisture but also providing oil control, but that sometimes was too much (and also wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up online (I know, I didn&#x27;t chat with my facialist--I&#x27;m a DIY gal), and found that this was supposed to work with my skin.  PERFECT!  Again, I do not use it everyday or everynight.  I do try to use it every night at the least, but it really it wonderful  I&#x27;m trying to use up the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; oil control moisturizer (and the heavier one on my hands!) and then I&#x27;ll explore again!  Truly this is a beautiful wonderful product line!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;What happened here?\\&quot; as I looked at my spiky eyebrows that were prepped and ready for war... and I have very fine eyebrow hair thank you very much. I tried everything to get this stuff to be more moisturizing and less waxy. I tried mixing it with oils and moisturizers that I use daily, and it just seemed to continue to suck the living life out my face. I mean we all know what it&#x27;s like to smile with a pound of make up on for some special event like being a bridesmaid or whatever, \\&quot;cheeeeeese\\&quot; quickly rub out the smile lines you just created... but first thing in the morning? Come on. I&#x27;m not break out prone or really that sensitive, but this stuff made my skin question everything it knew about itself, took me a week to bounce back. And for you ladies who do use makeup daily, water and oil, that&#x27;s the effect you will get. So, added it to my \\&quot;oh s***, waist of money\\&quot; spot under the bathroom sink... I truly hate that place, sigh.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Smells great and not greasy.  I use it as a day cream because of the SPF.</li>
            <li> Perfect for day moisturizer....</li>
            <li> Love the entire Eminence line of skin care.</li>
            <li> This is a great Moisturizer. It is non greasy or oily considering it has a built in SPF of 30. It feels great on the skin and is packed with effective ingredients that synergistically work well together, not to mention  this cream smells great which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Great product for daytime. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Red Current Moisturizer as a daytime/anti-age/sun protection moisturer for my acne prone skin. Have been using this for about 3 weeks now. Really liking this so far. Leaves my skin Moisturized with a satin matte finish for my oily/combination skin and does not break my out! Thanks Eminence.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite day cream. I get my SPF and my skin care, too. For reference, I have combination skin (oily t zone), starting to show the very first signs of aging.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and is as described!</li>
            <li> Gross. Product defective and unsanitary. Would b careful.</li>
            <li> suitable for oily skin</li>
            <li> The seal was not airtight. It was very loose (hence 3 stars)&lt;br /&gt;Smelled great, went on lightly.&lt;br /&gt;Such a bummer that my skin was allergic to it, but I was able to do a refund.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Eminence products from my spa or from the online store. Buying this from Amazon I found the price was more affordable at about $20 less. I have used some of their other products but I have found that this particular face moisturizer works best for my skin. I used to have more acne prone skin with a combination of being dry. For instance, I used to use the Tropical Vanilla Day Cream which is very moisturizing and nice, but with this Red Currant Moisturizer I feel I get the adequate amount of moisture without having excess shine/oil later in the day (like I did using other Eminence products or other brands in general). This item has a light weight to it and it&#x27;s nice that there is a SPF, too.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin! It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly. I have a problematic skin and can&#x27;t use anything that&#x27;s too heavy, so this is a very good find for me. My only problem is it&#x27;s a bit too light. When it&#x27;s a bit more cooler outside my skin feels on the drier side. Overall, however, it&#x27;s a great product for someone with combination and/ or oily skin.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I have normal/combination skin and I needed a good moisturizer for the spring and summer. I love this moisturizer especially the texture. I personally do not like gel textures so I like how this is a cream that blends out to a light finish. The SPF is also a plus and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has been raving about this moisturizer for a year.  I finally spent the $ and decided to try it. Worth every penny!  I saw a difference in my skin by the next morning.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try it.  I&#x27;m going to buy more of the Red Currant products.  This left me with a glow and great moisture. I was using the Arbonne RE9 before this and this moisturizer outperforms.  It is described as a light moisturizer but I would say that it&#x27;s more medium. Using it twice per day in winter has been perfectly sufficient.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition until I opened up the box and the moisturizer had leaked out and hardened on the inside of the box. Returning it. It is too expensive to lose any product.</li>
            <li> having been using for over one year and I love this product line</li>
            <li> This is the best day moisturizer I have ever used.  I have acne prone skin that is also a bit dry.  I wanted a moisturizer that had SPF, went on smooth, and wouldn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and this totally fit the bill.  Plus it feels absolutely amazing on your skin.  If you let it sink in for a few minutes before applying makeup, you can feel a cooling/tightening sensation.  It goes on well under makeup as well.  I wore it on my wedding day despite everyone&#x27;s warnings about SPF causing whiteness or chalkiness in pictures and you can not tell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must-buy if you have acne prone skin, or if you live in a humid environment.  It moisturizes without being even slightly greasy.  If you live in a dry climate, I might try something different.</li>
