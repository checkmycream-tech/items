            <li>and it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>the more you use it the more great fragrance you accumulate!</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients on the back and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but this is the perfect post shower lotion for me.</li>
            <li>He is happy and so am I. Thanks Amazon for another great buying experience.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free and very effective.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are others that work better.  </li>
            <li>Most \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; labels I find have a perfume/cologne smell to them.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion; doesn&#x27;t have a smell</li>
            <li>Best of all, long after the lotion is washed away</li>
            <li>Really good lotion, not too greasy and has a nice strong masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply all over the body</li>
            <li>ITS FINE.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very good but is not really unscented.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my mistake as I missed the fragrance free detail.</li>
            <li>It says fragrance free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite fragrance free</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know why they it says fragrance free</li>
            <li>I prefer the original fragrance over fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin, from hands to legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because it works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li>soon as skin on my hands and arms feel full comfort from the lotion&#x27;s effects, I immediately wipe any residual product or film from my palms and any areas of my arms that will contact any surface area of customers&#x27; property.</li>
            <li>So, the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li>It works great on keeping his skin nice and soft and not all dried out.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and easily absorbed</li>
            <li>fast absorbing lotion takes old spice, rubbing alcohol, Axe body spray, lotion, more old spice and combines it in one easy pump bottle!</li>
            <li>Vaseline is absolutely phenomenal; its fragrance free in a sense that compared to other lotions</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like cheap women&#x27;s perfume and baby powder and it is as strong or stronger as the scented kind, plus if you read the ingredient list (Which may take a while) it contains ethylene brassylate which is an artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Works really well</li>

            <li>Not fragrance free - only NO FRAGRANCE ADDED.</li>
            <li>but I assumed that it was a more watered down version of what I already had.  </li>
            <li>The regular men&#x27;s lotion from Vaseline has such strong smell--this is so much nicer for my husband!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d given up on Vaseline lotions years ago, because they all had so much alcohol that they dried more</li>
            <li>I purchased the extra strength vaseline lotion a while ago and it seemed to work well aside from a not unpleasant but over powering odor.  </li>
            <li>I would highly prefer a moisturizer that rubs into &amp;</li>
            <li>new Vaseline MEN</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel healthy and fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li>Spells like old people.</li>
            <li>I have very chapped hands during Winter months, from working outside and having to often wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m really surprised by how well this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>No longer will people look at you funny when you put aftershave on those pesky dry elbows,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what i am going to do with this stuff now that I have almost a full bottle (quite a bit leaked out in the mail.)  </li>

            <li> The fragrance is clearly present and somewhat neutral in scent - not feminine - but not masculine either.</li>
            <li> Getting older and things dry out a little</li>
            <li> and I use it daily to avoid dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but it not completely without scent.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not enough alcohol to dry your hands out, but it still dries quickly, so it&#x27;s not real</li>
            <li> all the other lotions have a very female perfume smell...</li>
            <li> the indoor humidity level has been below 30% which has caused chapped lips and dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> It does break down with water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical that Vaseline Men can replace O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, but I only use O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s before bed at night and Vaseline Men should help as a regular lotion used throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do want to mention that the price I paid was less then half of what I see here</li>
            <li> Disagree with the previous posts....</li>
            <li> for the scent, I can&#x27;t smell it, so I&#x27;m not sure what these other reviewers are complaining about.  </li>
            <li> His face gets flaky and dried out looking, but this lotion fixes all that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does leave an observable film - a very slight sliminess or coating after use.</li>
            <li> so when you take a shower and put this stuff on it loses a little softness.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is there but very very little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on spending money for expensive lotions,</li>
            <li> the smell is still working hard, so</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY DURING.THESE COLD MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to anyone that lives in a cold climate and has issues with dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is not a pleasant one by any means.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make him itch.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird watery consistency.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue.</li>
            <li> Although it was disappointing that it does have a scent.</li>
            <li> , the lotion itself is not that bad though</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has a very bad smell.</li>
            <li> It has been a brutal winter here in Chicago and</li>
            <li> I hated the smell lingering around all day as I went about my day.</li>

            <li> I prefer the original fragrance over fragrance free. This purchase was my mistake as I missed the fragrance free detail.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Always works well.  This lotion moisturizes ... it&#x27;s amazing that it does what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this lotion.  His face gets flaky and dried out looking, but this lotion fixes all that.  He is happy and so am I. Thanks Amazon for another great buying experience.</li>
            <li> It says fragrance free but it still has a scent. The scent is not a pleasant one by any means. Spells like old people. Regret purchasing and will throw the bottle out.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin, from hands to legs and arms.  Can be used on the face also.  Not greasy and easily absorbed</li>
            <li> This is how I can get my son to use lotion.  It says &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; on the front of the bottle.  So, it works!</li>
            <li> Works really well but it not completely without scent. My husband has sensitive skin and in the winter it gets really dry. It&#x27;s tough to find a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make him itch. This does the trick. Although it was disappointing that it does have a scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased the extra strength vaseline lotion a while ago and it seemed to work well aside from a not unpleasant but over powering odor.  I read several reviews on the fragrance free version that stated that it does have a smell but I assumed that it was a more watered down version of what I already had.  I was wrong.  This stuff smells like cheap women&#x27;s perfume and baby powder and it is as strong or stronger as the scented kind, plus if you read the ingredient list (Which may take a while) it contains ethylene brassylate which is an artificial fragrance.  Over all I&#x27;m not sure what i am going to do with this stuff now that I have almost a full bottle (quite a bit leaked out in the mail.)  The only reason I gave it two stars was for the price.</li>
            <li> I have very chapped hands during Winter months, from working outside and having to often wash my hands.  The best thing I&#x27;ve found for this problem is O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, but it&#x27;s expensive and difficult to use.  I&#x27;m skeptical that Vaseline Men can replace O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, but I only use O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s before bed at night and Vaseline Men should help as a regular lotion used throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on spending money for expensive lotions, but I&#x27;m sure there are others that work better.  However, I&#x27;m really surprised by how well this stuff works.  I&#x27;d given up on Vaseline lotions years ago, because they all had so much alcohol that they dried more then they hydrated.  But then I read about Vaseline Men in a magazine article on severely chapped hands and decided to give Vaseline another try.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because it works very well for the price.  There&#x27;s not enough alcohol to dry your hands out, but it still dries quickly, so it&#x27;s not real oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I can&#x27;t smell it, so I&#x27;m not sure what these other reviewers are complaining about.  I suppose any lotion is going to have some scent to it, but you have to really try to smell this stuff.  I wouldn&#x27;t really care if it did have a scent, but then I don&#x27;t worry myself with little things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention that the price I paid was less then half of what I see here and the bottle was even bigger.  I purchased it from a major retail B&amp;M store, but can&#x27;t recall if it was on sale or priced regularly.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin. Getting older and things dry out a little and this puts it back some.Fragrance is there but very very little. I notice it because I have allergies and some fragances bother me. But this one doesn&#x27;t one bit. It does break down with water so when you take a shower and put this stuff on it loses a little softness. I really like it this lotion.</li>
            <li> Been using for a year now!!&lt;br /&gt;This Vaseline is absolutely phenomenal; its fragrance free in a sense that compared to other lotions it&#x27;s pretty odorless.&lt;br /&gt;About to order from here all the time</li>
            <li> Most \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; labels I find have a perfume/cologne smell to them. This one is no different. I hated the smell lingering around all day as I went about my day. I had to wash it off. It also clogged my pores and broke out my face with blemishes. Do no recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already received and used the product. It definitely moisturizes. Skin absorption is almost immediate. We was our hands, figuratively speaking, every 5 minutes (yes, numerous times daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does leave an observable film - a very slight sliminess or coating after use. The fragrance is clearly present and somewhat neutral in scent - not feminine - but not masculine either. So, the scent is not bad. I would highly prefer a moisturizer that rubs into &amp;#34;invisibility-to-the-touch.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as skin on my hands and arms feel full comfort from the lotion&#x27;s effects, I immediately wipe any residual product or film from my palms and any areas of my arms that will contact any surface area of customers&#x27; property.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion, not too greasy and has a nice strong masculine smell. Not too durable unless you put a lot on.</li>
            <li> hey guys! Love incredibly pungent aftershave? Wish you could rub it on every inch of your body?? Well we have just the product for you! new Vaseline MEN fast absorbing lotion takes old spice, rubbing alcohol, Axe body spray, lotion, more old spice and combines it in one easy pump bottle! No longer will people look at you funny when you put aftershave on those pesky dry elbows, because HEY! ITS LOTION! Best of all, long after the lotion is washed away the smell is still working hard, so the more you use it the more great fragrance you accumulate! You&#x27;ll never have to shower again!!</li>
            <li> I apply after every shower. Makes my skin feel healthy and fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell weird. Especially great in the summertime on sun-soaked skin.</li>
            <li> Disagree with the previous posts.... all the other lotions have a very female perfume smell... this is the only one I&#x27;ve found with a neutral smell/odor.</li>
            <li> SCENTLESS FACE CREAM, MY HUSBANDS THOUGHTS ARE.....ITS FINE. IT DOES MOISTURIZE HIS FACE WELL ESPECIALLY DURING.THESE COLD MONTHS. GREAT VALUE... PROBABLY WILL LAST OVER A YR</li>
            <li> I love this lotion; doesn&#x27;t have a smell and I use it daily to avoid dry skin.  I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good but is not really unscented. Unfortunately, it has a very bad smell. I wish it could be odorless and I would definitely purchase it again if that is rectified.</li>
            <li> This works great on both body and face.  No odor.  Goes on easily.  No issue with breaking out.  I would suggest to anyone that lives in a cold climate and has issues with dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. It works great on keeping his skin nice and soft and not all dried out. easy to apply all over the body and it does not have a fragrance so it&#x27;s manly and not girly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised at how much I like this lotion. I read the ingredients on the back and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but this is the perfect post shower lotion for me. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird watery consistency. It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue. It lasts pretty much all day. I have darker skin and it&#x27;s a good choice. It&#x27;s not quite fragrance free but it&#x27;s close enough.</li>
            <li> It has been a brutal winter here in Chicago and the indoor humidity level has been below 30% which has caused chapped lips and dry, flaky skin.  This stuff is up to the task of keeping my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t have any type of perfume smell to it.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used many &amp;#34;men lotion&amp;#34; but was not impressed, this exceeded my exceptions and became my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li> The regular men&#x27;s lotion from Vaseline has such strong smell--this is so much nicer for my husband! Fragrance free and very effective.</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE CURDLED MILK! Not fragrance free - only NO FRAGRANCE ADDED. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> it has a perfume smell to it so I don&#x27;t know why they it says fragrance free, the lotion itself is not that bad though</li>
