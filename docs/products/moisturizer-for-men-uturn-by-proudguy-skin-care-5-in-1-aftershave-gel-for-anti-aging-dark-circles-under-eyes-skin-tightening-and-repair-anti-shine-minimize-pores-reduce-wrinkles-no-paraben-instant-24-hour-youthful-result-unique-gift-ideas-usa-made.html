            <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is really good</li>
            <li>Well I got the thumbs up, he loved it.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it and plan to purchase more when I need it.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging too!  </li>
            <li>his skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier in the mirror and it feels a good bit more revitalized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great moisturize right after I shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too soon to tell if it will reduce darkness and/or wrinkles, but it&#x27;s cool and feels good when putting it on.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the one thing I wish that gets a redesign for the better.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, goes on smooth, and he likes the feel of his skin.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes better than anything I ever purchased from a retail store.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I&#x27;m glad I found this product for my face.</li>
            <li>Plus, their customer service is over the top.</li>
            <li>I love the size and function of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I started to notice the difference in about 2 weeks and quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great gift for men because it is has natural ingredients, smells light and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a cool, refreshing fragrance that reminds me of cucumber.  </li>
            <li>Does work fine as a moisturizer, though.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and moisturizes without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the moisturizer he loves that it does not have a smell and leaves his skin smooth.</li>
            <li>But I have been wearing this for about 12 hours now, and my face still is as smooth as a moment after I put it on.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and does not leave a residue and the scent is not over powering, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Its nice that there is a high quality moisturizer made specially for men.  </li>
            <li>The lotion does not come out cleanly, it gets stuck to the bottle.</li>
            <li>There is a slight cooling sensation when I apply it to my face and the best thing is , it doesnt really have a strong smell at all.</li>
            <li>Price is right, will order again!</li>
            <li>Used this for 2 full months now and find it to be</li>
            <li>First, I tend to have dry skin on my forehead that doesn&#x27;t look so attractive.</li>
            <li>Noticed visible results in less than a week, and feels great.</li>
            <li>is pleasant and not really a girly smell.</li>
            <li>I, so far, love this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Proudguy!</li>
            <li>only okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy more in an instant.</li>
            <li>He will definitely want me to order him more.</li>
            <li>That was nice of them but as I read some of the other reviews I can&#x27;t help but feel there is self promoting going on.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh, smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>The first week of use made his skin look fantastic &amp; looked about 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;arrived fast to</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any difference in my face.</li>
            <li>For my husband to say that he loves something, means alot, he is very picky.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in my skin so fast and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>There are other products out there in this price range that work better for me.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this moisture.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few weeks ago and love it.</li>
            <li>,  you have a new customer.</li>
            <li>Has a faint smell, but it&#x27;s a pleasant one.</li>
            <li>The only problem:  my wife likes it so much she&#x27;s started using it for herself.  </li>
            <li>It also has a natural cucumber smell which isn&#x27;t intrusive or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients &amp; that it&#x27;s made in USA (not China).</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and it&#x27;s worked really well .  </li>
            <li>but so far I like this a</li>
            <li>the product smells and feels awesome, but the pump is crap.</li>
            <li>Not very effective gel for more dry skin - generally have to use a lot to not feel my skin drying out a few hours later, and that&#x27;s not cost effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bottle but lasts a long time because you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li>He said it absorbs quickly, very light smell &amp; no more shine that his other moisturizer left.</li>
            <li>For the dark circles, it hasn&#x27;t really helped with that at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mix well with any other products I normally use resulting in an unatural-looking shine.</li>
            <li>I still use an additional moisturizer due to dry skin, but this stuff worked really well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the stuff you want to get if you want a single product to take care of your skin , this is the one that will make a difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li> Third, I use it to address the dark circles under my eyes that I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to address a few different issues.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that never seems to be hydrated with other gels and lotions that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the gross flaky skin anymore over the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and have some dark patches of skin on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> This product has helped to diminish the dark circle and the dark patches.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will do anything about the dark circles under my eye (my genetics)</li>
            <li> The bottle did not last long and it was way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I apply this on my face and it helps moisturize my majorly dried skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a few weeks, he always likes to use things a few times before he decides if he likes it or not.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small and the pump is a little hard push so getting just a small amount takes some control.</li>
            <li> Very few things have though</li>
            <li> Feels sticky as it drys and gets hard to spread.</li>
            <li> Disappointed  </li>

            <li> This moisturizer is really good</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Has a faint smell, but it&#x27;s a pleasant one.</li>

            <li> the product smells and feels awesome, but the pump is crap. your gonna have to end up opening the bottle every time you use it and scooping out the lotion. if they would change the bottle, i would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and have used it 2 times. It moisturizes and does not leave a residue and the scent is not over powering, so far so good. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump. The lotion does not come out cleanly, it gets stuck to the bottle. That&#x27;s the one thing I wish that gets a redesign for the better.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It has a cool, refreshing fragrance that reminds me of cucumber.  It goes on smoothly and moisturizes without leaving a greasy residue.  I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and my face feels great.  The only problem:  my wife likes it so much she&#x27;s started using it for herself.  You should have a product for women, too.  (That way she&#x27;ll leave mine alone!)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for men. My husband just started using it yesterday and he can already feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Its nice that there is a high quality moisturizer made specially for men.  My husband really likes it.  Smells nice, goes on smooth, and he likes the feel of his skin.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. It moisturizes better than anything I ever purchased from a retail store. It&#x27;s a tiny bottle but lasts a long time because you do not need to use much. It also has a natural cucumber smell which isn&#x27;t intrusive or overpowering. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I like this but this pump bottle is not working for me at all. I can&#x27;t get it to come out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the moisturizer he loves that it does not have a smell and leaves his skin smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I&#x27;m glad I found this product for my face. It has been the only product so far that I&#x27;ve had real visual results from and that other friends or my family noticed as well. My skin looks healthier in the mirror and it feels a good bit more revitalized. There is a slight cooling sensation when I apply it to my face and the best thing is , it doesnt really have a strong smell at all. And what it does smell like is pleasant and not really a girly smell. This is the stuff you want to get if you want a single product to take care of your skin , this is the one that will make a difference in your skin.  Thanks Proudguy! This Gel gets an  A+ from me!</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer for my husband and he loves it.  I think this is a great gift for men because it is has natural ingredients, smells light and is non greasy. Love the packaging too!  I would highly recommend this moisture.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my guy friend, I&#x27;m not a guy so I dont know&lt;br /&gt;He seems like it though&lt;br /&gt;arrived fast to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too soon to tell if it will reduce darkness and/or wrinkles, but it&#x27;s cool and feels good when putting it on.  The bottle is small and the pump is a little hard push so getting just a small amount takes some control.</li>
            <li> Used this for 2 full months now and find it to be only okay. Feels sticky as it drys and gets hard to spread. I really don&#x27;t notice any difference in my face. There are other products out there in this price range that work better for me. I did get a follow up email from the company thanking me for the purchase. That was nice of them but as I read some of the other reviews I can&#x27;t help but feel there is self promoting going on.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this.  Didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel of it and, even though it is fragrance-free., it does have an odor I don&#x27;t care for at all. Does work fine as a moisturizer, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and love it. It makes my face feel fresh, smooth and younger. The smell and feel are both awesome. I&#x27;d buy more in an instant. Great product at a great price! Plus, their customer service is over the top.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product..would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Christmas along with a scrub cleanser for his face. The first week of use made his skin look fantastic &amp; looked about 5 years younger. He also likes the fact that there&#x27;s no sting or burn when applied after shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product. Noticed visible results in less than a week, and feels great. I still use an additional moisturizer due to dry skin, but this stuff worked really well. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after each shower for over a week now. I apply this on my face and it helps moisturize my majorly dried skin. This works better than any other moisturizer I have used. My skin looks and feels a lot healthier!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a few weeks, he always likes to use things a few times before he decides if he likes it or not.  Well I got the thumbs up, he loved it.  For my husband to say that he loves something, means alot, he is very picky.  It smells great, feels great going on and his skin feels amazing.  He will definitely want me to order him more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to address a few different issues. First, I tend to have dry skin on my forehead that doesn&#x27;t look so attractive. Second, I use it as an aftershave. Third, I use it to address the dark circles under my eyes that I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results are mixed. For moisturizing my forehead, it seems to be helping. I don&#x27;t notice the gross flaky skin anymore over the past few weeks.  For the aftershave it seems to lessen the redness I get after shaving but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it. For the dark circles, it hasn&#x27;t really helped with that at all. Very few things have though so I wouldn&#x27;t take that as a final review on the product for that specific purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it and plan to purchase more when I need it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for about a week &amp; is impressed.  He said it absorbs quickly, very light smell &amp; no more shine that his other moisturizer left. I like the natural ingredients &amp; that it&#x27;s made in USA (not China). The bottle size is 2 ounces-convenient packing for trips! Price is right, will order again!</li>
            <li> Disappointed  Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Well I must say this product is for me.  I love the size and function of the bottle.  It soaks in my skin so fast and is non-greasy.  I can now use a &amp;#34;beauty cream&amp;#34; and keep my manhood.  Thanks ProudGuy,  you have a new customer.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it&#x27;s worked really well .  I have dark circles under my eyes and have some dark patches of skin on my forehead.  This product has helped to diminish the dark circle and the dark patches. I started to notice the difference in about 2 weeks and quite pleased.  It&#x27;s also a great moisturize right after I shave and I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a day, so just keep that in mind while reading this. I, so far, love this product. I have dry skin that never seems to be hydrated with other gels and lotions that I have used in the past. But I have been wearing this for about 12 hours now, and my face still is as smooth as a moment after I put it on. My skin looks healthier and not as arid. I don&#x27;t know if it will do anything about the dark circles under my eye (my genetics) but so far I like this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump on it seems to not work that well. It eventually came out of the pump, but it took longer than it should have.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it but I will not purchase it again. The bottle did not last long and it was way too expensive.</li>
