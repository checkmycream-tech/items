            <li> The picture of the hat on line is exactly what is looks like. Very cute, stylish.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the ordering and shopping process exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly warm in single digits. Fun cool slouchy beanie. Felt like I should be boarding on snow or concrete.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick - high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount of slouch - warm and cozy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks good on everyone I gave to.</li>
            <li> I ordered thi hat for my 13 year old daughter and she LOVES it!  All her friends want me to order them one. The dark grey goes with everything and it is so soft and warm. I think I will order myself one also!</li>
            <li> I ordered two (2) of these caps for my wife and daughter-in-law.  I love how they look in cute hats and these are perfect!  Highly recommend this product and Seller.</li>
            <li> Way way way way way to slouchy. Just doesn&#x27;t look good at all. The material was also thin and looked a little cheap.</li>
            <li> While the hat is thick, it&#x27;s still lightweight enough. Soft and cozy.  Looks great. Love the dark grey color. Wish it came in some fun bright colors too. Highly recommend the seller too - quick with communication.</li>
            <li> Runs large.  Not the prettiest gray color.  Comfortable though.</li>
            <li> The hat fits nicely. A nice dark gray color. I wish I could find this hat in a thicker knit but it is well represented and it was delivered quickly. I also would buy this hat in a different color. I wish they had a larger variety of colors. Nice hat. I can recommend this hat to anyone looking for an attractive, casual hat.</li>
            <li> Very good quality,durability and the price was good too.Arrived on time,packaging was nice,no complaints.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Its so big you would think its made for a man with a larger sized head</li>
            <li> Cute hat but there is a big ugly label on the front that reads &amp;#34;DWP&amp;#34; that I was not expecting, and the picture on the listing does not reflect this label even being there. It is super stitched on so I cannot easily remove it without probably also destroying the hat. Returning it.</li>
            <li> Very stylish but the wind blows right through it. May not keep your head as warm as you&#x27;d like in colder climates.</li>
            <li> I really like this slouchy hat.  Look good and feels good.</li>
