            <li>, so I sometimes use two of them when I go out for many hours.</li>

            <li>If your want to look younger this is the best gift you could buy yourself.</li>
            <li>I think I have a better chance getting a job.  </li>
            <li>if you are showing any sagging of your jaw line so easy and sooooo effective gives you a brand new feeling of confidence and peopel are amazed at how good you look</li>
            <li>Men treat me better at the stores and are more friendly over all when i wear lifts then with out them .</li>
            <li>They work so well, but many times they were not too comfortable...</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>so itâ€™s easy to hide tabs under hair and will not show.</li>
            <li>The product work just fine</li>
            <li>I believe this might be a very good lift , i will know in a few more hours</li>
            <li>Visible and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>these are good for short periods of time more than that</li>
            <li>They REALLY work!!!</li>
            <li>love Secret Lift... my confidence is boosted and best of all these were discovered by my boyfriend!!!...</li>
            <li>I use these every day, not just for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy it again, a good joke only works once.  </li>
            <li>it truely is invisable tape.</li>
            <li>It is a nice concept and would be fabulous if it actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>Rather fun to see friends look and see something different, but not know why, but claim you look so fresh and good.</li>
            <li>This new improved product is fab...really easy to apply and comfortable to wear..</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I found this second generation product to be fine, but the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; had better choices in lifting.</li>
            <li>But he loves me with or without Secret Lift ..just likes to see me happy !!!</li>
            <li>This could easily become part of my normal make-up and hair routine.</li>
            <li>You MUST clean your skin first with alcohol to get rid of any oils, then I  apply tape and gently massaged it for a count of 100..</li>
            <li>These lift tabs do exactly what they say.  </li>
            <li>The adhesive sticks to your face very well!</li>
            <li>first I thought they were a joke, but boy was I suprised.</li>
            <li>They know I&#x27;m suddenly buying baby toys, which I am sure they know means I have a grandbaby.  </li>
            <li>It really changes things!</li>
            <li>I suggest to play with your face first to see wear</li>
            <li>My suggestion buy 2 or 3 because your going to turn around the next day and order more</li>
            <li>Not to be worn in real life!</li>
            <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve tried but a bit too expensive with the postage.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone!!  </li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>This new &amp;#34;Secret Lift Pro&amp;#34; is far better in my estimation..</li>
            <li>But they stay on, feel great, and really do take at least 10 years off your face.  </li>
            <li>So they know me as a  woman of a certain age who likes to scrapbook and do art projects.  </li>
            <li>They know I prefer modern literature to mysteries, and they know I love new technology, getting the kindle instantly and having two Echos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not think this product would really work, but wanted to give it a shot anyway.  </li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>Only I have been using the tapes with the elastic band and now they do not seem to be available.  </li>
            <li>When they become available again I will definitely stock up.</li>
            <li>I was very embarrassed when the tape popped off while singing.</li>
            <li>The tapes do not hold very well...</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li>They would have been so much nicer if they had worked.</li>
            <li>It absolutely takes 10 years off your appearance...</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old but most would say mid 50s.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day long and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this sound strange</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product just for kicks ...not really thinking it would work, however was I surprised.</li>
            <li>Guess I will have to wait to make this a daily routine since Amazon seems to run out of stock pretty fast</li>
            <li>Secret lift works good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the secret pro neck lift and I loved those</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34; with these new lifts.</li>
            <li>I wish they still make the ones for dark hair but light one will work too since they go under my hair anyway.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Must put on properly cleaning area to be taped with alcohol first</li>
            <li>What a great little invention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had them on for several hours in 85 degree heat to test them prior to going out in public.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and much less detectable.</li>
            <li>I have to say i look a whole lot younger with this on .</li>
            <li>who tells me how natural my face looks and unless you told people you were wearing them no one would know.</li>
            <li>It messes one&#x27;s hair, is a hassle to apply and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and have been told I look 45 years old</li>
            <li>and I am 56 yeats old.</li>
            <li>There was no way for me to hide the adhesive tape unless I put it directly in my hair, which would not work because it doesn&#x27;t stick well to hair.</li>
            <li>I worry my good friend Amazon has me wrong.  </li>
            <li>Great for taking photos to keep the shadows away from places they may want to settle, and also for a facial perkup for photo shoots if you haven&#x27;t gotten enough sleep, as long as it&#x27;s not stretched too tight.</li>
            <li>They are fine and do the job, but there is a small section of the tape that is visible.</li>
            <li>cause most of the time it is around 4 hours when the other lifts tape starting to come loose, i hope the rubber band does not loosen or break in front of people</li>
            <li>how well I washed my face, or used a alcohol rub, not to mention blotting the area with tape where the Secret Lift tape was to be placed it did not hold for  more than two or three hours.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the Secret Lift tape on a lot better.</li>
            <li>I found that Secret Lift Pro is somewhat better than the elastic bands, altho I do use both.  </li>
            <li>But, unfortunately, they&#x27;ll really only be useful for taking photos or maybe evenings out in very dark places because the tabs that stick to your face are VERY large and very visible, which would make you look sort of ridiculous if you tried to wear them anywhere with any kind of regular lighting.</li>
            <li>and if your hair is down on the sides you absolutely cant not see it.  </li>

            <li> There was no way for me to hide the adhesive tape unless I put it directly in my hair, which would not work because it doesn&#x27;t stick well to hair.</li>
            <li> I worry my good friend Amazon has me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Great for taking photos to keep the shadows away from places they may want to settle, and also for a facial perkup for photo shoots if you haven&#x27;t gotten enough sleep, as long as it&#x27;s not stretched too tight.</li>
            <li> They are fine and do the job, but there is a small section of the tape that is visible.</li>
            <li> cause most of the time it is around 4 hours when the other lifts tape starting to come loose, i hope the rubber band does not loosen or break in front of people</li>
            <li> how well I washed my face, or used a alcohol rub, not to mention blotting the area with tape where the Secret Lift tape was to be placed it did not hold for  more than two or three hours.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the Secret Lift tape on a lot better.</li>
            <li> I found that Secret Lift Pro is somewhat better than the elastic bands, altho I do use both.  </li>
            <li> But, unfortunately, they&#x27;ll really only be useful for taking photos or maybe evenings out in very dark places because the tabs that stick to your face are VERY large and very visible, which would make you look sort of ridiculous if you tried to wear them anywhere with any kind of regular lighting.</li>
            <li> and if your hair is down on the sides you absolutely cant not see it.  </li>
            <li> Again, lately they have stretched a bit more which makes them easier to use and not quite so tight.</li>
            <li> Have they realized I have purchased other joke gifts, such as the Lunch Lady Action Figure?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll start seeing adult diapers, walkers, hair dye and all the other trappings of age as suggested for me.</li>
            <li> If skin isnâ€™t loose enough, it does nothing (the bands are too long on most of them) if the skin is loose enough for this to tug it back at all, you get weird wrinkles where the tabs pull.</li>
            <li> It sticks and does not come loose if applied properly.</li>
            <li> They know what colors of nailpolish I like, that I enjoy fake diamond jewelry.  </li>
            <li> cause it was way to long even after putting knots in it.</li>
            <li> does not adhere to  skin for long and snapped off my head</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> A bit too long and doesn&#x27;t hold with any humidity.</li>
            <li> Would not stay on long.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair down to my knee&#x27;s and only wash it every third day.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t seem to get them to adhere to my skin for very long nor could I get them placed to where they could not be seen.</li>
            <li> I used other brands of lifts  before and have found all of them the tape comes loose and you can see the thing in my hair this one you can not see , I am going to add nexcare waterproof tape for add protection next time</li>
            <li> Sad but true ladies.</li>
            <li> The tapes came loose after a while and did not stick.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use them daily, but I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t have any when a special occassion comes along.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the tape will come loose or if it gets wet .</li>
            <li> i SPENT ABOUT $7000 A YEAR FOR FILLERS AND BOTOX.  </li>
            <li> I use a shower cap so the tape won&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> The secret lift pro tapes work well and are much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Will not work if your face gets remotely sweaty even though mine was not at the times</li>
            <li> Fun to play with to see how dramatic the before an after results can be!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard stories of them snapping off due to perspiration, which would be a disaster at, say, a business lunch.  </li>
            <li> Really give them a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I panic when I get down to about 6 tapes.</li>
            <li> The neck lift stayed on for less time than that.  </li>
            <li> Half of them broke before I could even put them on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cover my face with my hair so although by my ears..you can see them and certainly not cool when dating if you want to be kissed or touched...</li>
            <li> I only wear the face ones as i have slightly sagging jowls which disappear once Secret Lift Pro is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a few years,</li>
            <li> Waste of money.......</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t  wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money would not recommend.</li>
            <li> ReallU don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The tape is not strong and does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried hiding the tabs under makeup, but not sure if that would even work.</li>
            <li> Not enough hold, and difficult to conceal.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day, secret lift stays put..i&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 days out of one lift.</li>
            <li> seriously even my boyfrind thought i got work done.</li>
            <li> and seriously it makes me look like I&#x27;m 50.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not like it,  my skin got red and had an infection. . Hate it</li>
            <li> I also use this product and like it a lot. Again, lately they have stretched a bit more which makes them easier to use and not quite so tight.</li>
            <li> I did not think this product would really work, but wanted to give it a shot anyway.  Secret Lift Pro worked and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> The tape doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> Secret lift works good. easy to use</li>
            <li> shipped on time;  I like using this;  as described.</li>
            <li> As I have written before, this is a great product.  I never leave home without it!</li>
            <li> These work! They do lift your face and hold it up! And you can remove and reposition as many times as you need to and they still stick! But, unfortunately, they&#x27;ll really only be useful for taking photos or maybe evenings out in very dark places because the tabs that stick to your face are VERY large and very visible, which would make you look sort of ridiculous if you tried to wear them anywhere with any kind of regular lighting. I haven&#x27;t yet tried hiding the tabs under makeup, but not sure if that would even work. Maybe if you were an expert with latex?</li>
            <li> These lift tabs do exactly what they say.  They lift the sagging skin on your neck. No one knows I am wearing them and I like they why I look.  I am 70 years old but most would say mid 50s.  Give them a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> COSME SEARCH HIT THE JACK POT WHEN THEY CAME OUT WITH SECRET LIFT PRO.  bEFORE i SPENT ABOUT $7000 A YEAR FOR FILLERS AND BOTOX.  i TRIED THE TAPES WITH THE ELASTIC BAND AND METAL TAB.  THE TAB KEPT JUTTING INTO MY EAR.  THE ONE PIECE SECRET LIFT PRO FOR EYE AND FACE LIFT IS THE ANSWER TO MY WRINKLE PROBLEMS.  NOW i CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND NOT SEE A WRINKLED FACE, BUT ONE THAT LOOKS YOUNGER THAN I AM.  THANK YOU COSME SEARCH!!!&lt;br /&gt;SUSAN KAUFMAN&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;VE RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> OMG, I LOVE IT.. Really works</li>
            <li> I have tried several face lifts. These are the best. Will reorder these. Thank you for a great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 days out of one lift. I have really long hair down to my knee&#x27;s and only wash it every third day. I use a shower cap so the tape won&#x27;t get wet. The adhesive sticks to your face very well! I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars!!  It is absolutely amazing!  Only I have been using the tapes with the elastic band and now they do not seem to be available.  I do have the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; and like that as well but I prefer the elastic band and tapes..  Either way, this is an amazing product that takes years off your appearance. I absolutely love it!  Lasts all day long and comfortable.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> They are fine and do the job, but there is a small section of the tape that is visible. It should be in the skin color instead of white!</li>
            <li> The secret lift pro tapes work well and are much easier to apply. This could easily become part of my normal make-up and hair routine. The ones that you have to attach together takes longer and don&#x27;t stick as well. Guess I will have to wait to make this a daily routine since Amazon seems to run out of stock pretty fast and I&#x27;ve tried ordering from their website. It seems as though you can order any of their products there except this. They route you to amazon for these. When they become available again I will definitely stock up.</li>
            <li> I think the idea of giving your face a lift with tape is great, however, no matter how well I washed my face, or used a alcohol rub, not to mention blotting the area with tape where the Secret Lift tape was to be placed it did not hold for  more than two or three hours.  The neck lift stayed on for less time than that.  I&#x27;m an entertainer and was really looking forward to the great lift I saw demonstrated on Facebook.  I was very embarrassed when the tape popped off while singing. IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!</li>
            <li> The tapes do not hold very well...these are good for short periods of time more than that and you&#x27;re afraid the tapes are going to pop off...and embarrass the heck out of you...</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I absolutely love it. Fast and easy to apply. It delivers great results.</li>
            <li> I just love these!! I will order more and keep them in stock. I wish I could use them daily, but I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t have any when a special occassion comes along.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought they were a joke, but boy was I suprised. They REALLY work!!!</li>
            <li> I worry.  Somehow, this item popped up in a search and I latched on to it - it is the perfect joke gift for an aging friend&#x27;s birthday - is it not?  I made my purchase knowing that Amazon has lists and algorithms of everything you buy, everything you look at, everything you put in your cart and don&#x27;t buy - they know you. They have a profile of you.  And then they gear items towards you when you log in to make you buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So they know me as a  woman of a certain age who likes to scrapbook and do art projects.  They know what colors of nailpolish I like, that I enjoy fake diamond jewelry.  They know I&#x27;m suddenly buying baby toys, which I am sure they know means I have a grandbaby.  They know my health history and the items I&#x27;ve purchased to deal with that. They know I prefer modern literature to mysteries, and they know I love new technology, getting the kindle instantly and having two Echos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, I worry - have I wrecked the profile I have created with my purchases by buying these secret lift tapes?  Am I now going to be seeing all sorts of very weird, anti-aging technologies as I look through Amazon?  This tape is now permanently it my &amp;#34;Buy it Again&amp;#34; section, and I can&#x27;t get it out.  I&#x27;ll never buy it again, a good joke only works once.  I worry that Amazon will now think this is the kind of thing I like to buy and I&#x27;ll start seeing adult diapers, walkers, hair dye and all the other trappings of age as suggested for me. The Secret of these Secret Lift Tapes are that I didn&#x27;t buy them for me.  Will they know that?  Have they realized I have purchased other joke gifts, such as the Lunch Lady Action Figure?  Or do they take it straight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I worry. I worry my good friend Amazon has me wrong.  Perhaps I should have kept one of these tapes for myself, the worry lines are getting deeper.</li>
            <li> More snake oil. Same issue as with all others like this. Tried them on 4 different people. If skin isnâ€™t loose enough, it does nothing (the bands are too long on most of them) if the skin is loose enough for this to tug it back at all, you get weird wrinkles where the tabs pull. And, you can see the tabs</li>
            <li> Terrible, and no return option</li>
            <li> I will say these were very easy to apply. I had to cut the rubber band and tie it together cause it was way to long even after putting knots in it. I used other brands of lifts  before and have found all of them the tape comes loose and you can see the thing in my hair this one you can not see , I am going to add nexcare waterproof tape for add protection next time i wear these cause i am scared it i sweat the tape will come loose or if it gets wet . I have to say i look a whole lot younger with this on . Men treat me better at the stores and are more friendly over all when i wear lifts then with out them . I believe this might be a very good lift , i will know in a few more hours cause most of the time it is around 4 hours when the other lifts tape starting to come loose, i hope the rubber band does not loosen or break in front of people i would just die . I can not afford a face lift or a life style lift so i must use this kind of product .</li>
            <li> does not adhere to  skin for long and snapped off my head I am afraid to go out with it on my head improve product</li>
            <li> I found this second generation product to be fine, but the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; had better choices in lifting. I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product to women who have some sagging of the face and neck.  It really changes things!</li>
            <li> This new improved product is fab...really easy to apply and comfortable to wear..once applied you can forget about them!!!&lt;br /&gt;Having eczema I wash my hair every other day, secret lift stays put..i&#x27;m sure they would stay longer if i needed them too.I only wear the face ones as i have slightly sagging jowls which disappear once Secret Lift Pro is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I love Secret Lift... my confidence is boosted and best of all these were discovered by my boyfriend!!!...who tells me how natural my face looks and unless you told people you were wearing them no one would know.But he loves me with or without Secret Lift ..just likes to see me happy !!!</li>
            <li> I wanted the neck, face, and eye but I got all the same size.  I thought  they would be different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
            <li> a must if you are showing any sagging of your jaw line so easy and sooooo effective gives you a brand new feeling of confidence and peopel are amazed at how good you look</li>
            <li> I ordered this product just for kicks ...not really thinking it would work, however was I surprised. This is the greatest thing since Botox. omg it works just like it say it does. I just parted my hair then cleaned the area with alcohol and placed them wear i wanted the pull...I suggest to play with your face first to see wear you want it to pull then just simply put the tape there, press on tape for approx 30 seconds kindof rubbing and BAM you look 10 years instanly younger..lol my boyfriend got upset with me because we were at dinner and he thought i went an got botox and filler....then i showed him the tape.... so we later did his face lol....seriously even my boyfrind thought i got work done. it truely is invisable tape. and if your hair is down on the sides you absolutely cant not see it.  My suggestion buy 2 or 3 because your going to turn around the next day and order more</li>
            <li> These are totally awesome! I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a few years, so glad that I found them!</li>
            <li> I â€˜ve used elastic band for over 20 years. I used to make my own too. This product really works for me.  I have long hair so itâ€™s easy to hide tabs under hair and will not show. Make sure to wipe your skin with alcohol before you apply them. Elastic break once in a while, so I sometimes use two of them when I go out for many hours. I wish they still make the ones for dark hair but light one will work too since they go under my hair anyway.  I have been ordering this regularly now. Hope they wonâ€™t discontinue making them.</li>
            <li> The one piece lift pro was awful. Half of them broke before I could even put them on and  two of the ones I put on snapped off my face while I was out so I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34; with these new lifts. They would have been so much nicer if they had worked.</li>
            <li> Too visible as my hair is very short</li>
            <li> I have used the elastic bands for over 7 years...They work so well, but many times they were not too comfortable...This new &amp;#34;Secret Lift Pro&amp;#34; is far better in my estimation..Comfortable and much less detectable. You MUST clean your skin first with alcohol to get rid of any oils, then I  apply tape and gently massaged it for a count of 100..It sticks and does not come loose if applied properly. It absolutely takes 10 years off your appearance...I am never without it..</li>
            <li> You can see the band, if you can hide the part on your hair. I also thought short ones for the neck were included.</li>
            <li> They do work but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> What a joke. Waste of money.......</li>
            <li> yes they work. Went to costume shop and bought the glue that folks use for fake beards at Halloween.  Keeps the Secret Lift tape on a lot better. Very easy to use an does make a pretty impressive difference. Fun to play with to see how dramatic the before an after results can be!</li>
            <li> A bit too long and doesn&#x27;t hold with any humidity.</li>
            <li> Did not like them at all! Would not stay on long. I don&#x27;t cover my face with my hair so although by my ears..you can see them and certainly not cool when dating if you want to be kissed or touched...</li>
            <li> Unusable to a person with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer the individual tapes.  These just don&#x27;t stick as well.  I hope they improve because I like the the way it is made</li>
            <li> This product would only work to wear in photos. It messes one&#x27;s hair, is a hassle to apply and doesn&#x27;t look natural. Not to be worn in real life!</li>
            <li> For my purposs, this is wonderul.  It taks a bit of gtting usd to, but one you get the hang of it, you will love it.  This is my second set.</li>
            <li> The product work just fine I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> Rather fun to see friends look and see something different, but not know why, but claim you look so fresh and good.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve tried but a bit too expensive with the postage.If they made the postage cheaper I would buy these all the time,while saving for a face lift.</li>
            <li> Great for taking photos to keep the shadows away from places they may want to settle, and also for a facial perkup for photo shoots if you haven&#x27;t gotten enough sleep, as long as it&#x27;s not stretched too tight. Love these - order them all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. I love this product. I am 56 years old and have been told I look 45 years old and I am 56 yeats old. I wanted to have a face lift but with this product I will not be spending big dollars to have the same effect done. love love love the product.</li>
            <li> The tapes came loose after a while and did not stick. Will not work if your face gets remotely sweaty even though mine was not at the times I tried the product.</li>
            <li> Have tried putting these on and it is time consuming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the secret pro neck lift and I loved those but they&#x27;ve been out of stock so I thought I&#x27;d try these. Wish I hadn&#x27;t  wasted my money.  Not enough hold, and difficult to conceal.</li>
            <li> There was no way for me to hide the adhesive tape unless I put it directly in my hair, which would not work because it doesn&#x27;t stick well to hair. Anywhere on my face that I tried to place it stuck out like a sore thumb.</li>
            <li> I have been using the neck and jaw tapes for many years from Cosme search and they do an excellent job of getting rid of a turkey neck and tightening the jaw line,  I would highly recommend these to anyone!!  5 stars from me!!</li>
            <li> Visible and cheaply made. By far worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. Save yourself the cost unless you want to use noticeable strips all over your face.</li>
            <li> Waste of money would not recommend. Great if you ware a wig.</li>
            <li> This takes 10 years off instantly.  I use these every day, not just for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Wow!  These really work!  Watching Jane Fonda on &amp;#34;Grace and Frankie&amp;#34; on Netflix and her taking face lift bands off while removing her makeup, I found and immediately ordered some for myself.  What a great little invention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had them on for several hours in 85 degree heat to test them prior to going out in public.  I&#x27;ve heard stories of them snapping off due to perspiration, which would be a disaster at, say, a business lunch.  But they stay on, feel great, and really do take at least 10 years off your face.  I don&#x27;t need the neck lifts, so I&#x27;ll use the extra stick-ums for the face band.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they pop off for me. Wanted to love them. But they are fussy to use.</li>
            <li> Work good! Bands break in about a month with constant use.</li>
            <li> It is a nice concept and would be fabulous if it actually worked for me. I couldn&#x27;t seem to get them to adhere to my skin for very long nor could I get them placed to where they could not be seen.</li>
            <li> perfect easy to use  loving it.</li>
            <li> I found that Secret Lift Pro is somewhat better than the elastic bands, altho I do use both.  The bands are uncomfortable if used all day.  If I intend to wear them longer, I use secret lift pro.</li>
            <li> wonderful if you do drag.&lt;br /&gt;buy more than one cause they run out fast.&lt;br /&gt;lasted me all day.&lt;br /&gt;i use them to make my cheeks not look sunken in.</li>
            <li> I tried several times and did everything that was suggested. They just didn&#x27;t stick. I even prepped the skin. ReallU don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Really works. Must put on properly cleaning area to be taped with alcohol first</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like it should and tabs don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> If your want to look younger this is the best gift you could buy yourself. I&#x27;m 66 and seriously it makes me look like I&#x27;m 50. I can wear them all day and have no problems with them coming off. Maybe this sound strange but I feel so good about myself when I have them on. Really give them a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  The tape is not strong and does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Awesome for special events! Class Reunion lol!</li>
            <li> I panic when I get down to about 6 tapes. cant even stand to put my makeup on without my lift tape. Makeup just goes on like it did 20 years ago.LOVE  LOVE IT !!!  I&#x27;m 68 now and have always taken care of myself and now I need to go back to work .. I think I have a better chance getting a job.  Sad but true ladies.</li>
            <li> These are great for a non surgical facelift.  I use them whenever I go out.</li>
