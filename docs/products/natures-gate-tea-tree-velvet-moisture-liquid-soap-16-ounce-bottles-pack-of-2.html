            <li>Fresh, clean scent of tea tree oil and mint is pleasantly invigorating but&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering.</li>

            <li>i like this so much on my hands that i use it as body wash too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>a cap had loosened and there was soap in the shipping container, but not so much that it required returning.</li>

            <li>Even though I rinse my hands thoroughly, they sill feel really soft and velvety after drying.</li>
            <li>I think they added peppermint to the natural tea tree oil scent, which I would have preferred they not do.</li>
            <li>I brought this because it has natural oils in it that work as anti bacterial agents.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that tea tree oil is a natural way to prevent yeast infections.</li>
            <li>This might work for you if your hands are not particularly dry or sensitive to soaps.</li>
            <li>Too bad Amazon don&#x27;t sell larger quantity of this soap at their great prices.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the tea tree scent were toned down, but the utility and comfort this soap offers is worth the slight discomfort.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this locally.  I wish it were sold as a refill rather than buying the individual dispensers each time.  It has a mild sent, which is appreciated.</li>
            <li> i like this so much on my hands that i use it as body wash too. not drying and i don&#x27;t need to use a bath sponge with this. it foams up nicely and rinses clean. scent doesn&#x27;t linger or too strong.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  Generously sized, we love the natural antibacterial and ultra soothing properties of the tea tree!  The scent is minty and pleasing (my son say it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream)!!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews stating it was moisturizing.  This was not moisturizing for me but it did smell good.  After using harsh chemical soaps for months, my hands are very sensitive and prone to eczema.  This might work for you if your hands are not particularly dry or sensitive to soaps.</li>
            <li> Non drying. Didn&#x27;t irritate my dry skin. Good value, I&#x27;d be happy if they supplied refills..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree is antibacterial, however I didn&#x27;t find any &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; statement on the bottle.. which makes me wonder why Nature&#x27;s Gate avoid stating that. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> after washing your hands with this soap. Even though I rinse my hands thoroughly, they sill feel really soft and velvety after drying. In the couple weeks since switching to this soap my hands have never felt better. I have somewhat dry skin and most soaps really irritate my skin and I try to rinse well to prevent itchiness. I&#x27;ve found that not only do I not have to rinse very long but I rarely get itchy anymore and I love the smell of tea tree oils, which was what persuaded me to get this to begin with.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Nice, subtle scent. I will add this to my Subscribe &amp; Save items for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this liquid soap, especially for my face. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for the very first time and I love it!! I bought this soap because I&#x27;m allergic to Sulfate products. This soap is sulfate free with a great lather, you&#x27;ll love it!! The price was great and I received 2 for a low price.</li>
            <li> Silky hand wash. I think they added peppermint to the natural tea tree oil scent, which I would have preferred they not do. But I like the product.  There was one issue in shipping:  a cap had loosened and there was soap in the shipping container, but not so much that it required returning.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this helps get rid of it. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I used to order a similiar product from Melaleuca.  I don&#x27;t buy the Melaleuca anymore.  I use this as a shower gel and body wash. The  product is silky and non drying.  I like it because of the benefits of the of tea tree oil.  If you get, pimples, blisters, boils, scrapes, stings, etc.  the tea tree oil will help your skin to heal fast.  I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, I like it for everyday use. Too bad Amazon don&#x27;t sell larger quantity of this soap at their great prices. They have option from different seller but picture of the bottle looks different and I am wondering if that is the same soap.</li>
            <li> Great for use in shower and bath, rinses cleanly and sulfate free. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin&lt;br /&gt;or irritate. Fresh, clean scent of tea tree oil and mint is pleasantly invigorating but&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering. Gently cleanses oily skin without over drying.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the tea tree scent were toned down, but the utility and comfort this soap offers is worth the slight discomfort.  My eczema is much more easily controlled with a gentle, moisturizing soap; the tea tree also helps in this regard.  I do wish they&#x27;d add some lavender, both for the more pleasant scent and for the scar-minimizing qualities.</li>
            <li> I brought this because it has natural oils in it that work as anti bacterial agents. I also discovered that tea tree oil is a natural way to prevent yeast infections.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of tea tree (which I do), you will love this sopa.  Everyone who enters my home asks and comments about what fragence the soap is (I pour it into a decretive dispence so they can&#x27;t read the bottle), I continue to buy this brand for the price (compared to Paul Mitchell which is so expensive and the same to me).</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and packaged wonderfully. Bottles work fine. Scent is no over powering as long as you enjoy Tea Tree scent.  Doesn&#x27;t dry hands out with all the constant hand washing- I keep one at my kitchen sink. Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite hand soap.  It has a great scent that is not overpowering and leaves our hands clean and soft without any drying effect.</li>
