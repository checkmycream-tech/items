            <li>This is practical make up, kind of reminds me of something a business woman would keep in her arsenal.</li>

            <li>Overall I would say this a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>A bit of a splurge but such a wonderful purchase.</li>
            <li>I just find that I like Smashbox much better.  </li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are very neutral which is great</li>
            <li>DO SUGGEST THIS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO KEEP PALETES ON HAND.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the shadows sucked.</li>
            <li>Love It!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the colors, the quality and love</li>
            <li>I will definitley buy more UD products.</li>
            <li>I love all of the matte shades, as well at the one shimmery color, Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are much more powdery and don&#x27;t have the staying power.  </li>
            <li>I like to use it alone or combine more colors.</li>
            <li>Most colors are matte</li>
            <li>Great colors, and fabuloud product, it really stays on all day and</li>
            <li>Just love it all.</li>
            <li>i hope UD makes more of these soon</li>
            <li>maybe because most of the colors except for one are matte and i love that.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this pallet.</li>
            <li>I am not a make up girl, but I love this Palette.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li>&amp; I LOVE</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this again when I need more.</li>
            <li>I can mix them in many ways</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely love to buy this for my friends :)</li>
            <li>I really love this palette.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>i bought the basics one because it was the most affordable.</li>
            <li>Love the application and how it wears.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great starter if you are trying to experiment with different eye shadows and what looks good on you.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a primer underneath -</li>
            <li>more thing -</li>
            <li>Right before I got mine in the mail, I saw a woman saying on TV a good way to get excess powdered shadow off your cheeks is with scotch tape across the area where it fell on cheeks...</li>
            <li>This is absolutely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It came right on time and it&#x27;s amazing :)</li>
            <li>Just beware, the shadows are super powdery, so they&#x27;ll wear out quicker than most leading eyeshadows unless you use a very light brush touch.</li>
            <li>It is great for work and/or natural makeup looks.</li>
            <li>This palette is great for an earthy, natural look.  </li>
            <li>Great for days of early hiking, walking, biking, city touring when you don&#x27;t want to be all glittery and sparkly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift for anyone because the colors work with many skin tones and are neutral enough that I don&#x27;t know how someone wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li>they loved mine so much.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>easy to create</li>
            <li>I love that there is such a great mix of highlight, lid, crease, and liner shades.</li>
            <li>These neutral shades are perfect if you have a professional job and want a more natural look</li>
            <li>Love the large mirror too!!</li>
            <li>Urban Decay never fails to be perfect!</li>
            <li>&quot; the colors of my eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;These eyeshadows are easily applied and very complimentary.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li>Plus, the way it is described online seems accurate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect everyday pallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect palette for your everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>Great add-on to the Naked Palette 1</li>
            <li>This is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>themselves are really smooth</li>
            <li>They are primarily matte and the shimmery ones aren&#x27;t TOO shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely a great makeup basic.</li>
            <li>As with most palettes, not all colors are useful.  </li>
            <li>Silky shadows, good color range for a natural look.  </li>
            <li>I received the product on time and was delighted when I open the package to see the compact - just lovely</li>
            <li>But last time I took it with me, it was good. :)</li>
            <li>The range of shades in the new basic palette are perfect.</li>
            <li>MY ORIGINAL NAKED PALETTE IS HOME :) LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Fun to play with!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product in the mail...</li>
            <li>I find that I get much more use from this smaller (and cheaper) palette because the matte shades are more appropriate and practical for every day makeup.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks really pretty!  </li>
            <li>we were hoping that the package is bigger and have more colors for selection anyhow thank you its nice ...</li>
            <li>The beige/champagne at the far left has a bit of sparkle and works perfectly as a highlighter, the rest of the colors are matte.</li>
            <li>and so far, i love it!</li>
            <li>So pigmented and came right on time!</li>
            <li>They were right!</li>
            <li>really good basic eye shadow pallet although this is way too over</li>
            <li>Th coord are very bendable, love the effect.</li>
            <li>This is such good quality and I rave about it on my YouTube channel all the time....</li>
            <li>The shadows are so soft and pigmented, they blend so nicely and they all go together so well.</li>
            <li>and before I bought this set, I looked into lots of reviews and what others thought to be true....</li>
            <li>I have a nearly albino complexion and these look nice and understated on my skin.</li>
            <li>In a rush you can just sweep on one or two colors from the Basic pallet really quick and be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect for the more simple, natural, or even natural smokey make-up looks.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for work or if you like subtle make up.</li>
            <li>I have MAC products and I must say, I love the Urban Decay shadows much better.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin that is super prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li>I like this item very much!</li>
            <li>I own the original Naked palette and now this Basics palette.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite go-to palette.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for eyeshadow ($30), but since I was getting 6 colors I was sure to use</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased the first Naked pallet, loved it, and then the Basics Palette.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>I loved all the colors in this palette and they are applied very well, although you probably need eyeshadow primer to keep the eyeshadows to last all day.</li>
            <li>The Naked 1 and 2 palettes -- while arguably a better \\&quot;value\\&quot; because the cost per color is cheaper -- contained too many shimmery colors for me to get much use out of them.  </li>
            <li>worth the money to me</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money; Urban Decay eye shadows are high quality and have good color payoff.  </li>
            <li>The right amount of nude colors and the right price.</li>
            <li>just right  </li>
            <li>And this is NOT a counterfit palette which i&#x27;m happy about because i&#x27;ve had expierences in the past.</li>
            <li>I have the Naked 1 and 2 palettes and love them both, but as a 50 year old I feel that there are too many frosted shades.</li>
            <li>I just cut my hair short and this this natural makeup really makes my eyes look as great as my hair.  </li>
            <li>great for a small pallet.</li>
            <li>if you already own the original Naked palette or the Naked 2 palette - these colors were designed to coordinate with the original palettes, and in my experience they complement each other nicely.</li>
            <li>Every girl should have this cute little basic palette, i absolutely love it, the colors a great for someone who&#x27;s getting started with make up and they are not shimmery just basic matte but very pigmented plus the mirror inside the case is helpful</li>
            <li>the quality of the powders is very high, and every color is useful.</li>
            <li>I love that the shades are matte except for the first shade which I use for my inner eye corners.</li>
            <li>colors (except the first, lightest) are all matte.  </li>
            <li>I love the Urban Decay line of pallets and I&#x27;ve always wanted one, I thought I&#x27;d try out this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than the rest</li>
            <li>just as seen in picture but the case different color but overall great product color is very pigment so i would refer this product</li>
            <li>I love Urban Decay Products...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went in person to Sephora to check out the Naked palettes before buying one.  </li>
            <li>really love the naked 1 &amp; 2</li>
            <li>i use pretty much every color every time i put makeup on.</li>
            <li>(you can easily skip the 2nd Palette though).</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>So much fallout</li>
            <li>Mine seems real, anyway.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and stays on all day definitely recommend this, if you want neutral tones</li>
            <li>I personally use a damp face sponge lightly across the area it has fallen onto.  </li>
            <li>highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many YouTube videos showing you how to do really great looks with Urban Decay shadows that there is no way you can go wrong even if you are a make-up novice.</li>
            <li>I really like the eye shadow choices.  </li>
            <li>I know when something is a complete scam right away.</li>
            <li>I have two other U.D. palettes which i like more than this one.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other popular products, so I will probably keep them on hand too and aid in getting the right colors for my eyes and maybe mixed with some of my favorites Colors in the Urban Decay Naked Basics Palette.</li>
            <li>(quick prep) look, and there are several Youtube videos dedicated to it if you search the product name.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The shadows in this one are not as high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay never fails!</li>
            <li>i suppose this would be fantastic if you have no other naked palettes.</li>
            <li>I love this palette for everyday use.</li>
            <li>First time using Urban Decay....so many different looks available in this one small package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palettes, and this is the first one that included real nudes.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase drug store make-up, but this was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I use Crave only on the rare days that I don&#x27;t use a pen liner.  </li>
            <li>I want a clean daytime look or a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely not the right thing to buy it on here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d better order another one, because this won&#x27;t last long!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came earlier than expected</li>
            <li>The colors are very classy.</li>
            <li>I have several other shadows from UD 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>looks really natural!</li>
            <li>First off, there aren&#x27;t enough neutral color choices.</li>
            <li>smooth, long lasting and matte.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t harsh, it&#x27;s easy to blend, and the powder stays on well.</li>
            <li>colors need to show up a little more and there is a lot of extra fall off from the brush application.  </li>
            <li>a natural day time look as well as a night time smokey eye</li>
            <li>I looked over the packaging as well as all of the written stuff on the back, and it really seems legitimate.</li>
            <li>I work in a fast paced work environment and volunteer at my local shelter.</li>
            <li>natural que o produto deixa na producao do olho tipo:</li>
            <li>And it gives you a polished, professional look without screaming \\&quot;Look -- I&#x27;m wearing makeup.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s good quality eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and easy to bring ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li>I really think this product is real, contrary to a couple other reviews.</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly, but it was so small.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li>every make-up expert i know highly recommended anything from the NAKED line, and i needed a palette to start on.</li>
            <li>I have taken on a deeper interest in make up recently and this palette came highly recommended by friends as well as the reviews I have found online.</li>
            <li>Second, the colors look a little too grayish once they are on, or they are too light or shimmery.</li>
            <li>A natural look for your eyes, and with short hair your face is the focus.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely useful for an everyday</li>
            <li>My make up drawer is a lot less cluttered because I&#x27;ve thrown so much away.  </li>
            <li>, so far it looks like this is a product that will last for a LONG TIME!  </li>
            <li>There is a black, but I probably won&#x27;t use it, unless I&#x27;m doing a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that my favorite shade is called &amp;#34;Walk of Shame.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>You can create neutral to dramatic looks, and easily use the darkest shade for eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Recommend for everyone irrespective of eye color!:)</li>
            <li> Overall I would say this a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> A bit of a splurge but such a wonderful purchase.</li>
            <li> I just find that I like Smashbox much better.  </li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are very neutral which is great</li>
            <li> DO SUGGEST THIS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO KEEP PALETES ON HAND.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the shadows sucked.</li>
            <li> Love It!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love the colors, the quality and love</li>
            <li> I will definitley buy more UD products.</li>
            <li> I love all of the matte shades, as well at the one shimmery color, Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are much more powdery and don&#x27;t have the staying power.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it alone or combine more colors.</li>
            <li> Most colors are matte</li>
            <li> Great colors, and fabuloud product, it really stays on all day and</li>
            <li> Just love it all.</li>
            <li> i hope UD makes more of these soon</li>
            <li> maybe because most of the colors except for one are matte and i love that.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this pallet.</li>
            <li> I am not a make up girl, but I love this Palette.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li> &amp; I LOVE</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I can mix them in many ways</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely love to buy this for my friends :)</li>
            <li> I really love this palette.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> i bought the basics one because it was the most affordable.</li>
            <li> Love the application and how it wears.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great starter if you are trying to experiment with different eye shadows and what looks good on you.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use a primer underneath -</li>
            <li> more thing -</li>
            <li> Right before I got mine in the mail, I saw a woman saying on TV a good way to get excess powdered shadow off your cheeks is with scotch tape across the area where it fell on cheeks...</li>
            <li> This is absolutely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It came right on time and it&#x27;s amazing :)</li>
            <li> Just beware, the shadows are super powdery, so they&#x27;ll wear out quicker than most leading eyeshadows unless you use a very light brush touch.</li>
            <li> It is great for work and/or natural makeup looks.</li>
            <li> This palette is great for an earthy, natural look.  </li>
            <li> Great for days of early hiking, walking, biking, city touring when you don&#x27;t want to be all glittery and sparkly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would be a great gift for anyone because the colors work with many skin tones and are neutral enough that I don&#x27;t know how someone wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> they loved mine so much.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> easy to create</li>
            <li> I love that there is such a great mix of highlight, lid, crease, and liner shades.</li>
            <li> These neutral shades are perfect if you have a professional job and want a more natural look</li>
            <li> Love the large mirror too!!</li>
            <li> Urban Decay never fails to be perfect!</li>
            <li> &quot; the colors of my eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;These eyeshadows are easily applied and very complimentary.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li> Plus, the way it is described online seems accurate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect everyday pallet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect palette for your everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Great add-on to the Naked Palette 1</li>
            <li> This is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> themselves are really smooth</li>
            <li> They are primarily matte and the shimmery ones aren&#x27;t TOO shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a great makeup basic.</li>
            <li> As with most palettes, not all colors are useful.  </li>
            <li> Silky shadows, good color range for a natural look.  </li>
            <li> I received the product on time and was delighted when I open the package to see the compact - just lovely</li>
            <li> But last time I took it with me, it was good. :)</li>
            <li> The range of shades in the new basic palette are perfect.</li>
            <li> MY ORIGINAL NAKED PALETTE IS HOME :) LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Fun to play with!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product in the mail...</li>
            <li> I find that I get much more use from this smaller (and cheaper) palette because the matte shades are more appropriate and practical for every day makeup.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks really pretty!  </li>
            <li> we were hoping that the package is bigger and have more colors for selection anyhow thank you its nice ...</li>
            <li> The beige/champagne at the far left has a bit of sparkle and works perfectly as a highlighter, the rest of the colors are matte.</li>
            <li> and so far, i love it!</li>
            <li> So pigmented and came right on time!</li>
            <li> They were right!</li>
            <li> really good basic eye shadow pallet although this is way too over</li>
            <li> Th coord are very bendable, love the effect.</li>
            <li> This is such good quality and I rave about it on my YouTube channel all the time....</li>
            <li> The shadows are so soft and pigmented, they blend so nicely and they all go together so well.</li>
            <li> and before I bought this set, I looked into lots of reviews and what others thought to be true....</li>
            <li> I have a nearly albino complexion and these look nice and understated on my skin.</li>
            <li> In a rush you can just sweep on one or two colors from the Basic pallet really quick and be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perfect for the more simple, natural, or even natural smokey make-up looks.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for work or if you like subtle make up.</li>
            <li> I have MAC products and I must say, I love the Urban Decay shadows much better.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is super prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much!</li>
            <li> I own the original Naked palette and now this Basics palette.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite go-to palette.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for eyeshadow ($30), but since I was getting 6 colors I was sure to use</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased the first Naked pallet, loved it, and then the Basics Palette.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors in this palette and they are applied very well, although you probably need eyeshadow primer to keep the eyeshadows to last all day.</li>
            <li> The Naked 1 and 2 palettes -- while arguably a better \\&quot;value\\&quot; because the cost per color is cheaper -- contained too many shimmery colors for me to get much use out of them.  </li>
            <li> worth the money to me</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money; Urban Decay eye shadows are high quality and have good color payoff.  </li>
            <li> The right amount of nude colors and the right price.</li>
            <li> just right  </li>
            <li> And this is NOT a counterfit palette which i&#x27;m happy about because i&#x27;ve had expierences in the past.</li>
            <li> I have the Naked 1 and 2 palettes and love them both, but as a 50 year old I feel that there are too many frosted shades.</li>
            <li> I just cut my hair short and this this natural makeup really makes my eyes look as great as my hair.  </li>
            <li> great for a small pallet.</li>
            <li> if you already own the original Naked palette or the Naked 2 palette - these colors were designed to coordinate with the original palettes, and in my experience they complement each other nicely.</li>
            <li> Every girl should have this cute little basic palette, i absolutely love it, the colors a great for someone who&#x27;s getting started with make up and they are not shimmery just basic matte but very pigmented plus the mirror inside the case is helpful</li>
            <li> the quality of the powders is very high, and every color is useful.</li>
            <li> I love that the shades are matte except for the first shade which I use for my inner eye corners.</li>
            <li> colors (except the first, lightest) are all matte.  </li>
            <li> I love the Urban Decay line of pallets and I&#x27;ve always wanted one, I thought I&#x27;d try out this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than the rest</li>
            <li> just as seen in picture but the case different color but overall great product color is very pigment so i would refer this product</li>
            <li> I love Urban Decay Products...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went in person to Sephora to check out the Naked palettes before buying one.  </li>
            <li> really love the naked 1 &amp; 2</li>
            <li> i use pretty much every color every time i put makeup on.</li>
            <li> (you can easily skip the 2nd Palette though).</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> So much fallout</li>
            <li> Mine seems real, anyway.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly and stays on all day definitely recommend this, if you want neutral tones</li>
            <li> I personally use a damp face sponge lightly across the area it has fallen onto.  </li>
            <li> highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many YouTube videos showing you how to do really great looks with Urban Decay shadows that there is no way you can go wrong even if you are a make-up novice.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye shadow choices.  </li>
            <li> I know when something is a complete scam right away.</li>
            <li> I have two other U.D. palettes which i like more than this one.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other popular products, so I will probably keep them on hand too and aid in getting the right colors for my eyes and maybe mixed with some of my favorites Colors in the Urban Decay Naked Basics Palette.</li>
            <li> (quick prep) look, and there are several Youtube videos dedicated to it if you search the product name.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The shadows in this one are not as high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay never fails!</li>
            <li> i suppose this would be fantastic if you have no other naked palettes.</li>
            <li> I love this palette for everyday use.</li>
            <li> First time using Urban Decay....so many different looks available in this one small package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palettes, and this is the first one that included real nudes.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase drug store make-up, but this was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I use Crave only on the rare days that I don&#x27;t use a pen liner.  </li>
            <li> I want a clean daytime look or a more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely not the right thing to buy it on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d better order another one, because this won&#x27;t last long!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The colors are very classy.</li>
            <li> I have several other shadows from UD 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> looks really natural!</li>
            <li> First off, there aren&#x27;t enough neutral color choices.</li>
            <li> smooth, long lasting and matte.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t harsh, it&#x27;s easy to blend, and the powder stays on well.</li>
            <li> colors need to show up a little more and there is a lot of extra fall off from the brush application.  </li>
            <li> a natural day time look as well as a night time smokey eye</li>
            <li> I looked over the packaging as well as all of the written stuff on the back, and it really seems legitimate.</li>
            <li> I work in a fast paced work environment and volunteer at my local shelter.</li>
            <li> natural que o produto deixa na producao do olho tipo:</li>
            <li> And it gives you a polished, professional look without screaming \\&quot;Look -- I&#x27;m wearing makeup.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s good quality eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to bring ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I really think this product is real, contrary to a couple other reviews.</li>
            <li> it arrived very quickly, but it was so small.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li> every make-up expert i know highly recommended anything from the NAKED line, and i needed a palette to start on.</li>
            <li> I have taken on a deeper interest in make up recently and this palette came highly recommended by friends as well as the reviews I have found online.</li>
            <li> Second, the colors look a little too grayish once they are on, or they are too light or shimmery.</li>
            <li> A natural look for your eyes, and with short hair your face is the focus.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely useful for an everyday</li>
            <li> My make up drawer is a lot less cluttered because I&#x27;ve thrown so much away.  </li>
            <li> , so far it looks like this is a product that will last for a LONG TIME!  </li>
            <li> There is a black, but I probably won&#x27;t use it, unless I&#x27;m doing a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that my favorite shade is called &amp;#34;Walk of Shame.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> You can create neutral to dramatic looks, and easily use the darkest shade for eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit plain, but you can create so much depth and definition to the eyes with it.</li>
            <li> NewTechs was extremely helpful and professional with some issues that came up during shipping</li>
            <li> Very pigmented long lasting shadows that can make natural and dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> Obviously so you don&#x27;t notice that you have stuff that&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> , it just isn&#x27;t the urban decay I spent 30 some dollars on.</li>
            <li> I felt like this would be a palette I only use when travelling, which is not very often.</li>
            <li> I literally wear this product to work every single day.</li>
            <li> the colors do look nice in the palette, but will return it for at a sephora store :(</li>
            <li> I already have a few Urban Decay products in my make up case.</li>
            <li> BUT I saw it for sale at Ulta for the same price but without the shipping charges so I&#x27;d check out your mall and save yourself the wait and a few bucks.</li>
            <li> You need very little to have a big effect!!  </li>
            <li> It is a small palette, but that&#x27;s just how urban decay made it.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing  </li>
            <li> but with other colors.</li>
            <li> This pallet doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions (I believe some of the other pallets have diagrams) and it doesn&#x27;t come with any brushes.  </li>
            <li> Like every other cosmetic junkie, we purchase a color or brand in the hopes of finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I generally use either Walk of Shame (WOS) or Naked 2 as an all-over lid color, Venus (which does have a bit of shimmer) or Foxy under the brow and Faint in the crease and outer corner.  </li>
            <li> I do is put colors from one of my Naked pallets in my crease and on my lid and then sweep one of the lighter shades from the Basics pallet over everything to tie it together and make the overall look less dramatic.</li>
            <li> or if you just want to tone down things down a bit.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t think of getting any other colors aside from this palette!</li>
            <li> its fake it should have the same code it has on the box in the back of the acctual package and it dosent so its fake and very chalky</li>
            <li> but this is a good staple, even if it&#x27;s a little boring.</li>
            <li> When I got mine in the mail, half the shadows were broken,and the packaging itself look like an animal</li>
            <li> I use the darkest brown to fill in brows, the black as eyeliner and the lightest shimmery color as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> But when I opened it I noticed little scratches inside the palette.</li>
            <li> I use this for my everyday look.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday wether</li>
            <li> The price was way steeper than I typically pay for eye shadow but after using it the past few weeks the quality difference is undeniable.</li>
            <li> After about an hour of research and a close look to the back of the palette, I saw that a few things were spelled wrong among a few very small differences.</li>
            <li> Today I received my Naked Basics pallete and it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted matte, neutral eyeshadow and liner in a small compact with a mirror.  </li>
            <li> they least forever</li>
            <li> At least there not noticeable.</li>
            <li> i cant even wear the black or ill look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> I have since tried a few other products from this company, lipstick, base.....</li>
            <li> I was worried that the makeup might be broken from it being shipped to me</li>
            <li> B0028RC5N8 Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, Eyeshadow Base .34</li>
            <li> and what do you know, the wannabe repleca on amazon is a fake.</li>
            <li> You never know this could be a fake XD.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m sad to say its counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> I give it two stars because the makeup inside isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Every girl should have this cute little basic palette, i absolutely love it, the colors a great for someone who&#x27;s getting started with make up and they are not shimmery just basic matte but very pigmented plus the mirror inside the case is helpful</li>
            <li> great eyeshadows! smooth, long lasting and matte. A good pallet! If you have both Naked and Naked 2 you won&#x27;t regret getting the basic palette.</li>
            <li> Like these alot except that the palette is cooler than I like to use.</li>
            <li> Silky shadows, good color range for a natural look.  Easy to apply and blend. Great size for travel, perfect for day or night eye looks, just add mascara.</li>
            <li> I found it $10 cheaper at Ulta but I saved on gas.  I though it was the bigger palette but still very happy with it</li>
            <li> the palette is great for work and play! easy to create a natural day time look as well as a night time smokey eye</li>
            <li> This is a total scam! Girls trust me! I know when something is a complete scam right away. Today I received my Naked Basics pallete and it&#x27;s a fake. The packaging is way off and the eyeshadows are not the same color. Some of the eyeshadows were coming off the holder and the colors are not even matte they&#x27;re shimmery! I went to Ulta today to see the difference and what do you know, the wannabe repleca on amazon is a fake. I recommend you guys buy it some place else.</li>
            <li> Perfect mix of shades, goes on nicely, very matte look which is nice for those of us aging gracefully, love it</li>
            <li> Sephora and ulta sell for 22.00. It&#x27;s a perfect everyday pallet. I have several other shadows from UD 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loves this makeup. NewTechs was extremely helpful and professional with some issues that came up during shipping and I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I like this item very much! Light colors are especially great. I started with eye pencil of Urban decay and decided to try an eye shadow. Wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Recommend for everyone irrespective of eye color!:) looks really natural!</li>
            <li> I love this palette for everyday use. It is great for work and/or natural makeup looks. I love that the shades are matte except for the first shade which I use for my inner eye corners. I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li> really good basic eye shadow pallet although this is way too over priced.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I found this for 5.00 on ebay!!</li>
            <li> This palette is great for an earthy, natural look.  The colors aren&#x27;t harsh, it&#x27;s easy to blend, and the powder stays on well.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this set. Th coord are very bendable, love the effect. This is a perfect neutral pallet.</li>
            <li> Bought this before a 5-week, multi-country trip (only one carry-on!).  I bought it because I wanted matte, neutral eyeshadow and liner in a small compact with a mirror.  Bingo!  You can create neutral to dramatic looks, and easily use the darkest shade for eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it every day on my trip and with a dab of primer underneath it lasted well into the evening hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for travel because of its:&lt;br /&gt;-size&lt;br /&gt;-mirror&lt;br /&gt;-the fact that its an all-in-one that won&#x27;t go falling into the sink, rolling on the ground, lost in luggage of tiny hostels.&lt;br /&gt;-the colors (except the first, lightest) are all matte.  Great for days of early hiking, walking, biking, city touring when you don&#x27;t want to be all glittery and sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;-versatility of potential looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m home now, and still use it for daily wear.</li>
            <li> GREAT NUDE COLORS WITH NO SPARKLE.....LOVE LOVE LOVE!  TAKES AWHILE TO GET THREW THIS STUFF... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! IF YOU HAVE ;LOTS OF SPARKLE EYE SHADOWS GET THESE AS YOUR BASIC COLORS AS THE BASICS.</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors in this palette and they are applied very well, although you probably need eyeshadow primer to keep the eyeshadows to last all day. And this is NOT a counterfit palette which i&#x27;m happy about because i&#x27;ve had expierences in the past. It is a small palette, but that&#x27;s just how urban decay made it. Overall I would say this a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> This is such good quality and I rave about it on my YouTube channel all the time....haha. A bit of a splurge but such a wonderful purchase.</li>
            <li> I do like this palette.  I just find that I like Smashbox much better.  The colors in this palette are very neutral which is great but it seems like the texture isn&#x27;t that great.  It could be that I just prefer Smashbox eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I love the Urban Decay line of pallets and I&#x27;ve always wanted one, I thought I&#x27;d try out this one because it&#x27;s cheaper than the rest, it&#x27;s is so pigmented and it compliments every skin colour. It&#x27;s small and easy to bring ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best palettes I own! The shadows are so soft and pigmented, they blend so nicely and they all go together so well. I use this for my everyday look. I love that there is such a great mix of highlight, lid, crease, and liner shades. Will definitely repurchase when I run out. This is absolutely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> its fake it should have the same code it has on the box in the back of the acctual package and it dosent so its fake and very chalky...check me out on youtube my name is migdalia ponce</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND MATTE.&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET ONE SPARKLEY ONE FOR A NICE BRIGHT SHINY HIGHLIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO SUGGEST THIS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO KEEP PALETES ON HAND. I CARRY THIS IN MY BAG AND MY ORIGINAL NAKED PALETTE IS HOME :) LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> we were hoping that the package is bigger and have more colors for selection anyhow thank you its nice ...</li>
            <li> When I got mine in the mail, half the shadows were broken,and the packaging itself look like an animal had tried opening it b/c there were scratches all over it. On top of that, the shadows sucked. The only one that isn&#x27;t chalky is the white one with shimmer. So much fallout i cant even wear the black or ill look like a raccoon. I looked at a ton of reviews on this product before purchasing it. All of them said it was amazing... ITS NOT. I went to Ulta to see if it was legit (just in case) and it is. I&#x27;m sooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> just as seen in picture but the case different color but overall great product color is very pigment so i would refer this product</li>
            <li> Love It!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the colors, the quality and love how well they blend. The best eyeshadows outthere. I highly recommend them. I will definitley buy more UD products.</li>
            <li> It came right on time and it&#x27;s amazing :) So pigmented and came right on time! Love it! I was worried that the makeup might be broken from it being shipped to me but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Goes on effortlessly. First time using Urban Decay....so many different looks available in this one small package. Love the large mirror too!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing all the YouTube makeup gurus using it.  It&#x27;s the perfect palette for your everyday wear.  I have MAC products and I must say, I love the Urban Decay shadows much better.  They go on a lot smoother and blend easier.  This is a great palette to add to your makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I really think this product is real, contrary to a couple other reviews. Mine seems real, anyway. I looked over the packaging as well as all of the written stuff on the back, and it really seems legitimate. Plus, the way it is described online seems accurate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love these colors! Knew I wanted this palette the moment I laid my eyes on it. It is a bit plain, but you can create so much depth and definition to the eyes with it. Perfect for the more simple, natural, or even natural smokey make-up looks. I love all of the matte shades, as well at the one shimmery color, Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a 10 for me!</li>
            <li> love this palette, its so perfect for travel or for the bag in a case of emergency</li>
            <li> The range of shades in the new basic palette are perfect. I have the Naked 1 and 2 palettes and love them both, but as a 50 year old I feel that there are too many frosted shades. The matte shades in the basic palette are perfect for an understated look, and it is the perfect size for travelling. I&#x27;d better order another one, because this won&#x27;t last long!!!</li>
            <li> I have two other U.D. palettes which i like more than this one.  The shadows in this one are not as high quality. They are much more powdery and don&#x27;t have the staying power.  I read other reviews before purchasing  and they said the same thing, and I wanted to see for myself.  They were right!</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral palette! I like to use it alone or combine more colors. Most colors are matte i think there might be two shimmery shades</li>
            <li> Urban Decay never fails to be perfect! Very nice colors, nice travel size as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great colors, and fabuloud product, it really stays on all day and they are neutral colors so you can wear it with anything and it still looks good.</li>
            <li> I have decided to use makeup that is NOT tested on animals. I already have a few Urban Decay products in my make up case. I have oily skin that is super prone to blemishes. I work in a fast paced work environment and volunteer at my local shelter. I don&#x27;t always have time to blot my face or retouch my makeup, infant I never do. I use the setting spray and a cream eye primer of this brand. There are great neutral shades in this and 2 shades to do the smokey eye look. This is great! I think everyone should have this in your makeup bag! I have since tried a few other products from this company, lipstick, base.....this is the best makeup ever!</li>
            <li> I love Urban Decay Products...they least forever and the colors are perfect for ever day wear.  You need very little to have a big effect!!  Not to mention the fact I order this one afternoon and had it the next morning!  Saved me from running to the Mall!</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  It has the perfect nude shades for when I don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of color.  I&#x27;ve bought several &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palettes, and this is the first one that included real nudes.  The colors blend well, aren&#x27;t chalky and last all day.  There is a black, but I probably won&#x27;t use it, unless I&#x27;m doing a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that my favorite shade is called &amp;#34;Walk of Shame.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s the 21st century for goodness sake.</li>
            <li> I just cut my hair short and this this natural makeup really makes my eyes look as great as my hair.  A natural look for your eyes, and with short hair your face is the focus.  Easy to use and looks really pretty!  Fun to play with!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this palette? The Naked collection needs no word. Just love it all. Perfect for every day make-up... Great add-on to the Naked Palette 1 (you can easily skip the 2nd Palette though).</li>
            <li> My new favorite go-to palette.  I literally wear this product to work every single day. Great base for any look.</li>
            <li> finally a matte palette! this palette is definitely a makeup staple. colors glide on and blend great. i hope UD makes more of these soon but with other colors.</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types.. this is amazing to me.. maybe because most of the colors except for one are matte and i love that.</li>
            <li> Only one I would get. The right amount of nude colors and the right price.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this pallet. It is the perfect size for travel and has beautiful natural colors! I would recomend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> I am not a make up girl, but I love this Palette.  The colors are amazing and the quality of the make up is amazing.  Absolutely love Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> This is practical make up, kind of reminds me of something a business woman would keep in her arsenal. I like sparklier things but this is a good staple, even if it&#x27;s a little boring.</li>
            <li> Adorei o efeito natural que o produto deixa na producao do olho tipo: nasci assim! Muito bom, recomendo! Bom custo beneficio!&lt;br /&gt;Ótima fixação!</li>
            <li> I normally purchase drug store make-up, but this was recommended by a friend.  At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for eyeshadow ($30), but since I was getting 6 colors I was sure to use I couldn&#x27;t go wrong!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and my eyeshadow stays on all day &amp; I LOVE they are a matte finish....I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and do not need/want to wear glittery eyeshadow!! This pallet doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions (I believe some of the other pallets have diagrams) and it doesn&#x27;t come with any brushes.  I have had this for a month or so and use the Eco tools eye brush set, so far it looks like this is a product that will last for a LONG TIME!  I also bought one for my mom and mother-in-law b/c they loved mine so much.  I will be purchasing this again when I need more.</li>
            <li> The colors are very classy. I can mix them in many ways weather I want a clean daytime look or a more dramatic evening look. I don&#x27;t think even more expensive products compare to this. Love it.</li>
            <li> I so love this brand! I just couldn&#x27;t think of getting any other colors aside from this palette! It goes well with any complexion. I would definitely love to buy this for my friends :)</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly and stays on all day definitely recommend this, if you want neutral tones this is a winner</li>
            <li> I really love this palette. I bought 3 of this for me and my sisters. This is great for daily use. I really really love it! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s products...and before I bought this set, I looked into lots of reviews and what others thought to be true....colors need to show up a little more and there is a lot of extra fall off from the brush application.  Right before I got mine in the mail, I saw a woman saying on TV a good way to get excess powdered shadow off your cheeks is with scotch tape across the area where it fell on cheeks...I personally use a damp face sponge lightly across the area it has fallen onto.  I have used many other popular products, so I will probably keep them on hand too and aid in getting the right colors for my eyes and maybe mixed with some of my favorites Colors in the Urban Decay Naked Basics Palette.</li>
            <li> The colors blend well together and last throughout the entire day. Pricey, but worth the extra cost. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> All around great quality eye-shadow pallet. The pigments and colors are perfect the mirror is awesome and handy. The eye shadows themselves are really smooth I love all the colors! BUT I saw it for sale at Ulta for the same price but without the shipping charges so I&#x27;d check out your mall and save yourself the wait and a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Urban decay is king of the palettes. Best for me bc it&#x27;s not too many colors to choose from. Excellent</li>
            <li> Awesome color palette if you&#x27;re looking for a bright eye that pops. Just beware, the shadows are super powdery, so they&#x27;ll wear out quicker than most leading eyeshadows unless you use a very light brush touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went in person to Sephora to check out the Naked palettes before buying one.  The Naked 1 and 2 palettes -- while arguably a better \\&quot;value\\&quot; because the cost per color is cheaper -- contained too many shimmery colors for me to get much use out of them.  I find myself reaching for this set every day when I go to work.  I generally use either Walk of Shame (WOS) or Naked 2 as an all-over lid color, Venus (which does have a bit of shimmer) or Foxy under the brow and Faint in the crease and outer corner.  I use Crave only on the rare days that I don&#x27;t use a pen liner.  On top of the UD eye primer potion, the staying power is great.  And it gives you a polished, professional look without screaming \\&quot;Look -- I&#x27;m wearing makeup.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife who was looking for make up like this. She is a cosmetologist and was very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> i love this product!  every make-up expert i know highly recommended anything from the NAKED line, and i needed a palette to start on. i bought the basics one because it was the most affordable. and so far, i love it! it&#x27;s extremely useful for an everyday (quick prep) look, and there are several Youtube videos dedicated to it if you search the product name. the quality of the powders is very high, and every color is useful. highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this product.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, beautiful shapes.  I received the product on time and was delighted when I open the package to see the compact - just lovely</li>
            <li> This is the best matte palette ever! I use this everyday wether Im going out for a night on the town or attending a PTO meeting. Its a must in any makeup bag.</li>
            <li> If you just go on to UrbanDecay.com and type in Naked Palletes. 3 show up. Naked pallete 1, 2 and the basic one too. Here it&#x27;s 30+ on the website it&#x27;s 20+ it&#x27;s definitely not the right thing to buy it on here. You never know this could be a fake XD. I didn&#x27;t buy the product from here I just wanted to give ya&#x27;ll a heads up👍</li>
            <li> Love it!  Product as described. Arrived on time.  Love the application and how it wears. great for a small pallet.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m sad to say its counterfeit. After about an hour of research and a close look to the back of the palette, I saw that a few things were spelled wrong among a few very small differences. Obviously so you don&#x27;t notice that you have stuff that&#x27;s not real. It&#x27;s cheaper on the urban decay website, guys. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it here. I give it two stars because the makeup inside isn&#x27;t that bad, it just isn&#x27;t the urban decay I spent 30 some dollars on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome the colors just right  every diva should have it got their collection I also recommend the nake blush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came earlier than expected and I like the product. But when I opened it I noticed little scratches inside the palette. At least there not noticeable.</li>
            <li> These neutral shades are perfect if you have a professional job and want a more natural look or if you just want to tone down things down a bit. They are primarily matte and the shimmery ones aren&#x27;t TOO shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is put colors from one of my Naked pallets in my crease and on my lid and then sweep one of the lighter shades from the Basics pallet over everything to tie it together and make the overall look less dramatic. In a rush you can just sweep on one or two colors from the Basic pallet really quick and be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find any colors from all three of these pallets that don&#x27;t work together; they all blend together perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many YouTube videos showing you how to do really great looks with Urban Decay shadows that there is no way you can go wrong even if you are a make-up novice. This would be a great gift for anyone because the colors work with many skin tones and are neutral enough that I don&#x27;t know how someone wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift this Christmas.  I really like the eye shadow choices.  It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s good quality eye shadow.  I think it&#x27;s a great starter if you are trying to experiment with different eye shadows and what looks good on you.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for work or if you like subtle make up. The beige/champagne at the far left has a bit of sparkle and works perfectly as a highlighter, the rest of the colors are matte. I have a nearly albino complexion and these look nice and understated on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend, and she loved it, she was really happy with this product, nice case, and beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product in the mail...it arrived very quickly, but it was so small. I would have been happier if the palette were a bit larger for the price- the colors do look nice in the palette, but will return it for at a sephora store :(</li>
            <li> I felt like this would be a palette I only use when travelling, which is not very often. But last time I took it with me, it was good. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the naked 1 &amp; 2 so those are my favourite for when I&#x27;m home heading out.</li>
            <li> love the colors and pigmentation! Urban Decay never fails! i use pretty much every color every time i put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I have tons of urban decay and mac products, but I thought i would like this one for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look. First off, there aren&#x27;t enough neutral color choices. Second, the colors look a little too grayish once they are on, or they are too light or shimmery. I was hoping for all matte colors, and they are not. I returned it, as I have naked and naked 2 already, I was looking at this as the matte companion, oh well. i suppose this would be fantastic if you have no other naked palettes. (then i&#x27;d probably give it a 5 lol)but really I&#x27;d only use one color in this kit since I do have the others!</li>
            <li> Like every other cosmetic junkie, we purchase a color or brand in the hopes of finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  Well, I purchased the first Naked pallet, loved it, and then the Basics Palette.  It applies, blends, and layers like silk.  With or without eye shadow primer it doesn&#x27;t crease.  My make up drawer is a lot less cluttered because I&#x27;ve thrown so much away.  This is the perfect every day pallet.</li>
            <li> I own the original Naked palette and now this Basics palette.  I find that I get much more use from this smaller (and cheaper) palette because the matte shades are more appropriate and practical for every day makeup.  It is well worth the money; Urban Decay eye shadows are high quality and have good color payoff.  Be sure to use a primer underneath - [[ASIN:B0013CSGBE Too Faced Cosmetics, Shadow Insurance, 0.35 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B0028RC5N8 Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, Eyeshadow Base .34 fl oz (10 ml)]] are two good options.  This will help your eye makeup last longer and prevent it from creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing - if you already own the original Naked palette or the Naked 2 palette - these colors were designed to coordinate with the original palettes, and in my experience they complement each other nicely.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product&lt;br /&gt;The colors APPEAR like a great selection of matte colors especially perfect for weddings for you makeup artists...&lt;br /&gt;BUT NO!&lt;br /&gt;I have to use an eye shadow primer AND liquiset to get these colors to pop, and they still dissapoint after all that&lt;br /&gt;I even tried good ole fashioned water...no&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money to me</li>
            <li> Very pigmented long lasting shadows that can make natural and dramatic looks. I use this every day.Some shades even have a dual purpose  . I use the darkest brown to fill in brows, the black as eyeliner and the lightest shimmery color as a highlighter. Definitely a great makeup basic. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have taken on a deeper interest in make up recently and this palette came highly recommended by friends as well as the reviews I have found online. The price was way steeper than I typically pay for eye shadow but after using it the past few weeks the quality difference is undeniable. I am in love, this is my palette for life!</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!  A matte palette I can use.  I am 64 and I am ALWAYS searching for matte colors.  As with most palettes, not all colors are useful.  This palette not only contains ALL matte colors, but all the colors are useable.  It was perfect for me.  I have blue eyes, blonde hair and because of my age, I wanted to \\&quot;tone down\\&quot; the colors of my eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;These eyeshadows are easily applied and very complimentary.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
