            <li>I love this product, perfect black soap.</li>
            <li>Very mild aroma.</li>
            <li>It is a huge chunk of soap</li>
            <li>though I was going to receive one great big hunk like the picture and have to cut it up myself and Saran Wrap it.</li>
            <li>It is the healthiest alternative to regular soaps and has a great lather.</li>
            <li>Great product can&#x27;t remember if this was the same company I bought this product from or not, but received my order in timely manner</li>
            <li>Again,  I received my order in 4 days and it is the best quality black soap I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Rich, lathery, with  </li>
            <li>I found it first in St Augustine, FL and wanted more.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so clean</li>
            <li>We bath with this soap and everyone in our house has noticed how clean and healthyour skin has gotten.</li>
            <li>other than that it is a good product and is authentic</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase more..</li>
            <li>But stones don&#x27;t clean very well and kind of hurt my more sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>Oh, it came true to weight.</li>
            <li>This soap was full of grit, shells and dirt as if someone scraped the bottom of the pot, packaged it up and sold it to me.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap and it was very fresh, I been use Africa soap for a long time, I love the way that it makes my skin feels,</li>
            <li>Both have improved tremendously with this soap.</li>
            <li>I like the quick suds and way</li>
            <li>else-.The lather alone is worth the cost-</li>
            <li>I make my own simple 50/50 mix for liquid soap.</li>
            <li>the weight is right</li>
            <li>This is some of the best black African soap I have ever used thank you so much.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>On time the price is right the product is as described it is exactly as it should be trust me</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping .</li>
            <li>have a rare form of psoriasis and my old free trade village is having problems.</li>
            <li>I like it but be aware there are some impurities.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used this vendor Atharva Products.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing!  </li>
            <li>Each package was exactly 10.00 lbs each.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was weigh them separately.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect fancy packaging, you&#x27;ll receive a box with a bag of product inside but for the value you&#x27;re getting, who cares about a pretty package?</li>
            <li>This is the most concentrated soap I know of, I used to buy it in the liquid form from ebay, now I purchased in solid form here.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several people and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Great black soap!!!</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, it usually last me for 3 or more months.</li>
            <li>my package was shipped very fast and i highly recommend buying from this buyer;-)</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>This is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>This much soap for the price is a godsend.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind storing when you can save so much money.</li>
            <li>Listen real 100%</li>
            <li>its really works</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Most people who buy RAW african black soap Know how great it is and wonder why would a person use anything</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I would get from my natural shop in Philly.</li>
            <li>that piney smell that any black  soap lover will love.</li>
            <li>It was delivered short weight but their customer service handled the discrepancy quickly and  efficiently.</li>
            <li>I hope the quality stays high.  </li>
            <li>I have not purchased form this company-but They  seem to have the best price on RAW african black soap.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe this is authentic African Black Soap and will continue to search for the real thing.</li>
            <li>a lot of bamboo wood and very very rocky can not wash with it will cut skin and make you blead i have been using raw african soap for many years and never got this in my soap will not buy ever again from them</li>
            <li>When I weighed this product it was only 8.5lbs VERY unacceptable !</li>
            <li>Not a foo foo full of fluff soap.</li>
            <li>it came faster than expected and is true to listing.</li>
            <li>Gives a lather very quickly with just a little soap.  </li>
            <li>I will do so as soon as I run it through my process, I only expect it to be as nice if not better than the ones I have used before.</li>
            <li>Not filled with stones that scratch your face and a stingy feeling to your face afterwards like it&#x27;s too strong...</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, it melts down easily, mixes very well with essential oils, and the lather it gives is heavenly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using raw black soap for years and this product is of the same great quality I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li>The soap is great for eczema suffers.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep her hair soft and from falling out.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t directly rub it on your face.</li>
            <li>I make my soaps, perfumes;etc because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a really thick moisturizer like shea butter, you&#x27;re going to need  it.</li>
            <li>Not going to bore you with a long review so here it is quick and simple.</li>
            <li>Not only did this black soap arrive quickly, but it is the real deal which leaves my hair and skin squeaky</li>
            <li>I usually make my own soap but will not be making as much now that I have found the African Black soap.</li>
            <li>u really have to be careful with the pieces of coal, but that also let me know that it is natural and have not been processed.</li>
            <li>I have tried various black soaps and this is definitely high quality authentic black soap!</li>
            <li>It is natural and made in africa the african way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M SO PLEASE THAT SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK AND BELIEVE IN NATURAL PRODUCTS AND TO BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, will last me a long time!</li>
            <li>But be careful its not like most commercial soaps, a small piece is all you need.</li>
            <li>This soap seems to be less processed and uniform than other black soaps I have purchased but it lathers nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I love raw black soap from Ghana.</li>
            <li>it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>this is genuine african black soap unlike the black bars of soap you will find in beauty supply stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li>No good when you are using the it to clean your body.</li>

            <li> its really works</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Most people who buy RAW african black soap Know how great it is and wonder why would a person use anything</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I would get from my natural shop in Philly.</li>
            <li> that piney smell that any black  soap lover will love.</li>
            <li> It was delivered short weight but their customer service handled the discrepancy quickly and  efficiently.</li>
            <li> I hope the quality stays high.  </li>
            <li> I have not purchased form this company-but They  seem to have the best price on RAW african black soap.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this is authentic African Black Soap and will continue to search for the real thing.</li>
            <li> a lot of bamboo wood and very very rocky can not wash with it will cut skin and make you blead i have been using raw african soap for many years and never got this in my soap will not buy ever again from them</li>
            <li> When I weighed this product it was only 8.5lbs VERY unacceptable !</li>
            <li> Not a foo foo full of fluff soap.</li>
            <li> it came faster than expected and is true to listing.</li>
            <li> Gives a lather very quickly with just a little soap.  </li>
            <li> I will do so as soon as I run it through my process, I only expect it to be as nice if not better than the ones I have used before.</li>
            <li> Not filled with stones that scratch your face and a stingy feeling to your face afterwards like it&#x27;s too strong...</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, it melts down easily, mixes very well with essential oils, and the lather it gives is heavenly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using raw black soap for years and this product is of the same great quality I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> The soap is great for eczema suffers.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep her hair soft and from falling out.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t directly rub it on your face.</li>
            <li> I make my soaps, perfumes;etc because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a really thick moisturizer like shea butter, you&#x27;re going to need  it.</li>
            <li> Not going to bore you with a long review so here it is quick and simple.</li>
            <li> Not only did this black soap arrive quickly, but it is the real deal which leaves my hair and skin squeaky</li>
            <li> I usually make my own soap but will not be making as much now that I have found the African Black soap.</li>
            <li> u really have to be careful with the pieces of coal, but that also let me know that it is natural and have not been processed.</li>
            <li> I have tried various black soaps and this is definitely high quality authentic black soap!</li>
            <li> It is natural and made in africa the african way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO PLEASE THAT SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK AND BELIEVE IN NATURAL PRODUCTS AND TO BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> But be careful its not like most commercial soaps, a small piece is all you need.</li>
            <li> This soap seems to be less processed and uniform than other black soaps I have purchased but it lathers nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I love raw black soap from Ghana.</li>
            <li> it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> this is genuine african black soap unlike the black bars of soap you will find in beauty supply stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li> No good when you are using the it to clean your body.</li>
            <li> it lathers fast and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it last very long</li>
            <li> this is a miracle for those who suffer from skin conditions such as acne, oily skin, eczema, dry skin, dandruff, or ringworm.</li>
            <li> Raw African Soap is NOT black in color</li>
            <li> There are tiny, scratchy, black stones, likely used as filler in the soap.</li>
            <li> African Black Soap will definitely be in our home, and in others, from now on.&lt;br /&gt;The product came as described and was delivered when promised.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> -Now it can dry your skin</li>
            <li> I really appreciated this being broken and sealed into individual bars.</li>
            <li> My wife immediately had to purchase some African Black Soap after hearing all of all the healing properties that it has.  </li>
            <li> I have been using African black soap for about 15 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I must say that all raw African black soap is not created equal.  </li>
            <li> I have found yarn and smail rocks in the soap.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now constantly in the kitchen thinking of other ways she can incorporate this black soap into other recipes.</li>
            <li> I have recommended to other family and friends.</li>
            <li> Even our friends have been sold on raw African black soap now.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I have used for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> careful though,it has a few rocks in it</li>
            <li> black  </li>
            <li> I also ordered the black soap.  </li>
            <li> black  soap  </li>
            <li> he break  pieces  of black soap put in water  </li>
            <li> I am having a little problem with it</li>
            <li> they said that they had a little itching from using the soap.  </li>
            <li> but I sell raw black soap</li>
            <li> I personally have not experienced any irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> I did not see any result, what a waste of money....</li>
            <li> I was at a loss as to where I would get unrefined black soap, but no more.</li>
            <li> Now let me take a look at the raw ivory Shea butter or the Kpangya butter from this</li>
            <li> that is why you buy Raw shea butter to moisturize but</li>
            <li> others I&#x27;ve bought from amazon in past</li>
            <li> When my box came it was very heavy,</li>
            <li> It does need to be shaken, not good for pump-type dispensers...</li>
            <li> not good found ethnic hair</li>
            <li> Now the bad part; it will make a mess out of your soap dish.</li>
            <li> I just received this ABS today, I removed it from the package and started cutting.</li>
            <li> Immediately after receiving it she soaked some overnight in water and gave the soap mixture to my nephew who suffers from acne.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery, will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so clean</li>
            <li> I love this soap and it was very fresh, I been use Africa soap for a long time, I love the way that it makes my skin feels, Its clean your skin really good and you will no the different.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using raw black soap for years and this product is of the same great quality I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best black African soap I have ever used thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li> I love raw black soap from Ghana. I travelled to Ghana nine years ago and watched as this product was being made in one of the villages. I did not bring any home because I was concerned about the weight in my luggage. I love the smell and the lather. You can use it on your skin and hair. I personally have not experienced any irritation from this product. However we all have different skin and hair types, so what works for one may not be beneficial to someone else.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It was also sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I did not see any result, what a waste of money....</li>
            <li> I like it but be aware there are some impurities.  I have found yarn and smail rocks in the soap.  Lathers very well.  Very mild aroma.</li>
            <li> I was getting my soap from another source.  This is much nicer.  My customers love it!  I use it to wash my hair, and it works beautifully.  I do need to write to them for an ingredient list, however.  Not listed on the package.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping . Fastest I have ever seen . The soap comes in a nice square block which is a lot better to cut .</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price and truly a Great deal. This is the first time that I have used this vendor Atharva Products. I just received this ABS today, I removed it from the package and started cutting. I LIKE IT A LOT. but the proof is in the pudding which I may not get to until Friday but I will be back for a further review. I will do so as soon as I run it through my process, I only expect it to be as nice if not better than the ones I have used before. &amp;#34;We will see.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The best  natural  soap out there use it every  day also makes  good  liguid  black  soap  easily  excellent  product  will buy plenty  more</li>
            <li> I would not buy from this vendor again. There are tiny, scratchy, black stones, likely used as filler in the soap. No good when you are using the it to clean your body. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I love this product, perfect black soap. Rich, lathery, with  that piney smell that any black  soap lover will love. This much soap for the price is a godsend.  Will definitely come back to this supplier.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was first impressed with the swift delivery.. 2 days,!! Without rush shipment!! When my box came it was very heavy, 20 lbs. because I ordered two. I had no idea what could have been in the box that the cute UPS man dropped off at my home. I&#x27;m guessing my husband ordered me a nice bowling ball for Christmas. Then he called me to say he received an email that the soap would arrive today. OMG! I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be here for two weeks. I LOVE IT!!!! It is exactly what I would get from my natural shop in Philly. Same smell, stones and lather. The price was fair, I wasn&#x27;t happy about the shipping but okay. I love the soap and this is all my family uses so I will continue to order it from this company. It is the real thing!  Oh, it came true to weight. Each package was exactly 10.00 lbs each. The first thing I did was weigh them separately. I will call you on cheating me out of what I paid for. On your packing slip you&#x27;ll find  directions on how to use the soap and the soap ingredients list. Thanks!  Now let me take a look at the raw ivory Shea butter or the Kpangya butter from this co.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!! :-)</li>
            <li> My wife immediately had to purchase some African Black Soap after hearing all of all the healing properties that it has.  Immediately after receiving it she soaked some overnight in water and gave the soap mixture to my nephew who suffers from acne. It works!! Not only has his skin cleared but it has also healed his scarring. She&#x27;s now constantly in the kitchen thinking of other ways she can incorporate this black soap into other recipes. African Black Soap will definitely be in our home, and in others, from now on.&lt;br /&gt;The product came as described and was delivered when promised. Will definitely repurchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated this being broken and sealed into individual bars. That was perfect. I though I was going to receive one great big hunk like the picture and have to cut it up myself and Saran Wrap it. Its great soap and at the best cost I have found.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Exactly what i wanted....</li>
            <li> We bath with this soap and everyone in our house has noticed how clean and healthyour skin has gotten. Even our friends have been sold on raw African black soap now. Great product and tons cheaper than we&#x27;ve found in stores</li>
            <li> BEWARE of the content weight.  Excellent product  but 9 pounds 5.5 ounces is not 10 lb.</li>
            <li> awesome. This soap bubbles well and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped when I use it. The soap is great for eczema suffers. It can be used as a all body, head to toe cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap. I have rosacea and open pores. Both have improved tremendously with this soap. It was delivered short weight but their customer service handled the discrepancy quickly and  efficiently. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not only did this black soap arrive quickly, but it is the real deal which leaves my hair and skin squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;I have a rare form of psoriasis and my old free trade village is having problems. I was at a loss as to where I would get unrefined black soap, but no more. Excellent service, fair prices, and the real deal! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted.  It cleans well  It is good on my skin.  I am pleased that this was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use. I use it as shampoo, body wash, soap, face cleaner -- everything.  It is a huge chunk of soap but I don&#x27;t mind storing when you can save so much money.</li>
            <li> this soap is really nice it last very long</li>
            <li> First of all. I have not purchased form this company-but They  seem to have the best price on RAW african black soap.I would buy from them but I sell raw black soap and I get it wholesale.It is the only soap I have used for at least 5 years.Listen real 100% Raw African Soap is NOT black in color it is Brown.It is natural and made in africa the african way.It is not from a factory so yes you will find some brunt pieces in the soap-just remove it.Most people who buy RAW african black soap Know how great it is and wonder why would a person use anything else-.The lather alone is worth the cost-I won\\&quot;t even mention how you are actually clean!Great Shampoo-body wash-facial cleanser-Now it can dry your skin that is why you buy Raw shea butter to moisturize but hey-that&#x27;s another review.&lt;br /&gt;I did decide to place an order and I have ordered several times since then.Top Quality!The Soap and Shea Butter.WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Gives a lather very quickly with just a little soap.  Cleans well.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It is the healthiest alternative to regular soaps and has a great lather. You can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> i shop here religiously n id swear by this soap. JUST BUY IT</li>
            <li> It is so worth it to buy the 10lb soap!!  Already cut into bars. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good quality soap. I like the quick suds and way it does not dry out my skin. Beautiful product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and have already given friends some to try.</li>
            <li> Great product i&#x27;m extremly happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, it usually last me for 3 or more months. This is a multi purpose soap. The only dislike I have about the soap is u really have to be careful with the pieces of coal, but that also let me know that it is natural and have not been processed. I will continue to purchase this soap, it helps me save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s authentic and does the job</li>
            <li> We love the soap. I chop it up and put in a pump bottle it dissolves and have a very nice liquid soap. I found it first in St Augustine, FL and wanted more. The price is VERY good thru Amazon. I have recommended to other family and friends. It is good for cleaning your rings while washing your hands as well. I also use it on my face. Great soap. I usually make my own soap but will not be making as much now that I have found the African Black soap. My husband likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I love it and I will order again</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> and my skin loves.  My daughter&#x27;s hair thrives with this soap as a shampoo. It helps to keep her hair soft and from falling out.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN BUYING,THE SMELL THE LOOK IS NOT THE SAME AN WHATS UP WITH THE COAL IN IT</li>
            <li> Not going to bore you with a long review so here it is quick and simple. This soap works wonders! Use it on all your body parts :-) careful though,it has a few rocks in it so don&#x27;t directly rub it on your face. Keep away from water when not in use or it will melt into liquid soap. I will buy this again GO Padres!</li>
            <li> Very good product the salt leathers very well easy to connect will recommend it to family and friends very good price receives my order in a matter of days very pleased</li>
            <li> On time the price is right the product is as described it is exactly as it should be trust me the weight is right</li>
            <li> This soap seems to be less processed and uniform than other black soaps I have purchased but it lathers nice and cleans well. I have found 3 quartz stones in it ranging in size from almonds to walnuts. I&#x27;d like to think this is because it is hand processed by locals in Ghana and that I am helping to support their livelihood. But stones don&#x27;t clean very well and kind of hurt my more sensitive parts. For the price, it is still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I started ordering from this company last year and wrote a glowing review about the unfiltered shea butter they have.  I was so impressed with their level of service and product quality I also ordered the black soap.  I am very happy to say, they did not disappoint! Again,  I received my order in 4 days and it is the best quality black soap I have ever used!  I make my soaps, perfumes;etc because I have extremely sensitive skin. The ingredients are all natural, it melts down easily, mixes very well with essential oils, and the lather it gives is heavenly! Don&#x27;t expect fancy packaging, you&#x27;ll receive a box with a bag of product inside but for the value you&#x27;re getting, who cares about a pretty package? SmellGood has definitely earned a lifetime customer!!!!</li>
            <li> Not filled with stones that scratch your face and a stingy feeling to your face afterwards like it&#x27;s too strong...&lt;br /&gt;like others I&#x27;ve bought from amazon in past</li>
            <li> greatt texture and sudzy too!</li>
            <li> this is a miracle for those who suffer from skin conditions such as acne, oily skin, eczema, dry skin, dandruff, or ringworm. it lathers fast and a little bit goes a long way. this is genuine african black soap unlike the black bars of soap you will find in beauty supply stores and drug stores. my package was shipped very fast and i highly recommend buying from this buyer;-)</li>
            <li> The soaps lather is great, and you are squeaky clean. Great as a shampoo. Now the bad part; it will make a mess out of your soap dish. You may want to cut a piece that fits in a sealed container? We bought the big chunk and split it with friends. Much more affordable then purchasing it off the shelf.</li>
            <li> This is the most concentrated soap I know of, I used to buy it in the liquid form from ebay, now I purchased in solid form here. I make my own simple 50/50 mix for liquid soap. It does need to be shaken, not good for pump-type dispensers... so what! Hair and body both, glad I found it years ago. Perfect service from the store. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Not a foo foo full of fluff soap. The lather is absolutely amazing. But be careful its not like most commercial soaps, a small piece is all you need. Make sure you have a really thick moisturizer like shea butter, you&#x27;re going to need  it. Excellent soap.</li>
            <li> black  soap  its great , we use on our skin very smooth skin, my husband uses for a after shave, no razor bumps  at all he break  pieces  of black soap put in water  bottle fill up  bottle with  water  shake  bottle up  and use suds and apply  on face  after shaving. its really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO PLEASE THAT SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK AND BELIEVE IN NATURAL PRODUCTS AND TO BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC. IF IT WASN&#x27;T FOR THIS SELLER POSTING THEIR PRODUCT ON AMAZON I WOULDN&#x27;T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY  TO PURCHASE IT, LIVING IN A RURAL AREA. THANK YOU AMAZON AND THE SELLER.</li>
            <li> Great product can&#x27;t remember if this was the same company I bought this product from or not, but received my order in timely manner and it was 100% what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am having a little problem with it they said that they had a little itching from using the soap.  What is going on with this one?  I would love to get some more but I am going to wait for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using African black soap for about 15 yrs.  I must say that all raw African black soap is not created equal.  This is one of the best quality soaps I have purchased in all those years.  I hope the quality stays high.  I will certainly purchase more..</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent it came faster than expected and is true to listing. I have recommended this product to several people and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great black soap!!! I have tried various black soaps and this is definitely high quality authentic black soap! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> not good found ethnic hair a lot of bamboo wood and very very rocky can not wash with it will cut skin and make you blead i have been using raw african soap for many years and never got this in my soap will not buy ever again from them</li>
            <li> When I weighed this product it was only 8.5lbs VERY unacceptable ! other than that it is a good product and is authentic</li>
            <li> This soap was full of grit, shells and dirt as if someone scraped the bottom of the pot, packaged it up and sold it to me.  I salvaged the lot by putting it in water and siphoning off the soapy water to be used.  I cannot believe this is authentic African Black Soap and will continue to search for the real thing.</li>
