            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Her hair always looked beautiful - shiny with defined curls and never stiff.</li>
            <li>Easy to style after applying and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>The best part of this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t make the hair look wet and crackly.  </li>
            <li>I finally found it on Amazon and was so happy.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using this product but so far i am really impressed.</li>
            <li>She said the price was great - she usually pays much more per tube.</li>
            <li>I feel like I AM styling when my head is full of wired.</li>
            <li>You can use it a few times in between washings and your hair will always look great.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to sticky, heavy gels.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that I straighten my hair I still use it as a heat protector.</li>
            <li>light application and light fluffing and crunching of hair with a low heat will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and was ecstatic to see this so fairly priced here as opposed to what I paid previously at CVS.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much &amp; defines the curls .  </li>
            <li>my favorite hair care products, I only  use this  brand, and this product , have been for years ... A+++</li>
            <li>and I apply this first then my Deva Arc Angel.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon for always saving me big cash!!!</li>
            <li>and occasionally i use it to make my curls look better.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;s more likely to get a head-scratch from his dear wife at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I use this produce for my side swept bangs and my top short layers for volume.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products throughout my life, and this is definetly one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that gets frizzy really quick if I don&#x27;t use any product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, was worried that it would not be as thick as the one I purchased at the beauty supply store!</li>
            <li>He loves rusk wired and we order 20 at a time because it is so much cheaper online than buying it at the store.  </li>
            <li>My split ends have decreased greatly while using this as a result of not having to re-curl day after day.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>He has since switched over which makes packing for travel that much easier.</li>
            <li>The product was very watery and could not be used.</li>
            <li>and Iiked it so much that I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I first got it while living in Idaho and could not find it where I live now.  </li>
            <li>This product does not make my hair sticky or greasy like so many other do.  </li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s a great addition to my leave in and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or dry like gels and mouse.</li>
            <li>I need to keep the frizz down and it gives me a smooth, shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>I run a little bit of this through my wet hair, and I have nice curly hair....</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair and use it any time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cream that would bring out my natural curl and THIS PRODUCT does it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff----its pretty much the only thing that will tame my hair! !!!</li>
            <li>I just put it on my hair after i towel dry and really work it into my bangs and layers, and blowdry and straighten.</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t use the product, all I can say is that my curly haired sister swears by it and says no other styling product tames and defines her curls like Rusk Wired,.</li>
            <li>Lately I found a small amount left and decided that I really liked it &amp; would go online &amp; search for it which I did &amp; found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>When the product arrived it is as though it was exposed to extreme high heat.</li>
            <li>(if I&#x27;m wearing my natural curl) or blow dry it (if I plan use a curling iron).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lately I found a small amount left and decided that I really liked it &amp; would go online &amp; search for it which I did &amp; found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived it is as though it was exposed to extreme high heat.</li>
            <li> (if I&#x27;m wearing my natural curl) or blow dry it (if I plan use a curling iron).</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my bang in place even though they usually have a tendacy to want to part and separate.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product not cause your hair to look crispy or wet, it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy either.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and style it with some wave to it.  </li>
            <li> it only takes a little &amp; a bottle will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair after curling it and before styling.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, but you have to be careful not to glob too much on in one area because it is a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my wet hair and either let it air dry</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer always on time and what I expected.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> Waste if money.</li>
            <li> I used the product a few years ago and cannot believe I didn&#x27;t buy it again until now.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down the hair or make it greasy if you use a small amount.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 3-4&amp;#34; past my shoulders, so it has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days and never have a that greasy look at the roots.</li>
            <li> My hair will hold a curling iron curl for 4 days if I&#x27;ve used this product (as opposed to 1-2 days usually).</li>
            <li> My husband used it when he ran out of his usual styling cream.</li>
            <li> It almost makes your hair pliable without it being crunchy or feeling greasy or heavy!</li>
            <li> Though it says to use a liberal amount I&#x27;d suggest to start off small.</li>
            <li> it holds well and for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> I save at least four dollars a tube!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> my favorite hair care products, I only  use this  brand, and this product , have been for years ... A+++</li>
            <li> Love this stuff,  I&#x27;m a curly girl and I apply this first then my Deva Arc Angel. This is great for finger curling. I am a repeat buyer always on time and what I expected.</li>

            <li> Rusk Wired is the BEST hair product I have used on my hair. I have natural curly hair that gets frizzy really quick if I don&#x27;t use any product.  I run a little bit of this through my wet hair, and I have nice curly hair....no frizz!  It is the absolute best!!!!</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  My husband loves this stuff.  Not too heavy or greasy and he can style his hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Wired truly brings out the beautiful curls in my hair, and it truly moisturizes my hair which gives my&lt;br /&gt;hair a healthy shine! I have been using this product sine 2006!!! Best price on Amazon I save at least four dollars a tube!!! I love Amazon for always saving me big cash!!!</li>
            <li> Best gel!  My husband has tried all different mens and women&#x27;s gels in search of the perfect hold and the perfect look.  He loves rusk wired and we order 20 at a time because it is so much cheaper online than buying it at the store.  it holds well and for at least 5 years.  I personally love the smell of it and occasionally i use it to make my curls look better.  The best part of this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t make the hair look wet and crackly.  if you&#x27;re a man and looking for a gel this is a good one to try!</li>
            <li> This product is works! I have naturally wavy/curly hair and use it any time I wash my hair. My hair is about 3-4&amp;#34; past my shoulders, so it has some weight to it. I apply it to my wet hair and either let it air dry (if I&#x27;m wearing my natural curl) or blow dry it (if I plan use a curling iron). Not only does this product not cause your hair to look crispy or wet, it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy either. I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days and never have a that greasy look at the roots. My hair will hold a curling iron curl for 4 days if I&#x27;ve used this product (as opposed to 1-2 days usually). On the rare occasion that I straighten my hair I still use it as a heat protector. So, my hair literally always has this in. My split ends have decreased greatly while using this as a result of not having to re-curl day after day.&lt;br /&gt;Good for men too! My husband used it when he ran out of his usual styling cream. His hair is probably 1.5&amp;#34; at its longest point. He has since switched over which makes packing for travel that much easier. Since it doesn&#x27;t have that waxy texture he&#x27;s more likely to get a head-scratch from his dear wife at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my cousin who&#x27;s hair I always admire. I wanted a cream that would bring out my natural curl and THIS PRODUCT does it. It won&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, but you have to be careful not to glob too much on in one area because it is a heavy cream. light application and light fluffing and crunching of hair with a low heat will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff----its pretty much the only thing that will tame my hair! !!!</li>
            <li> Stays in all day! Easy to style after applying and smells fantastic! Only hair product I will use!</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product but so far i am really impressed. I use this produce for my side swept bangs and my top short layers for volume. It almost makes your hair pliable without it being crunchy or feeling greasy or heavy! I just put it on my hair after i towel dry and really work it into my bangs and layers, and blowdry and straighten. It really helps keep my bang in place even though they usually have a tendacy to want to part and separate. Will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and shipped promptly.  As for the styling cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for years for my unruly curly hair.  For me it&#x27;s a great addition to my leave in and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or dry like gels and mouse.</li>
            <li> This works wonderful on curly hair. You don&#x27;t have to use very much &amp; defines the curls .  this is a great finish for your hair.  Until I wash it all I need to do is spray with water to restyle - so only use the product when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product &amp; have used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair for years instead of detangling products.  I also use it on my hair.  it only takes a little &amp; a bottle will last a very long time.  It does not weigh down the hair or make it greasy if you use a small amount.</li>

I will now keep it as a staple for my hair regime. :) I love what it&#x27;s done for my hair!!!!!! It does just as it stated-helps with frizz but does not have a stiffening affect. Smells great too! Would recommend it to anyone! Though it says to use a liberal amount I&#x27;d suggest to start off small. THANKS RUSK for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with shipment. Thank you.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with the product. Great hair creme. But they charged me for the postage in the post office. Not that I had to go to the post office to pick it up. I also had to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional cost that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Terrible. Never again I am buying anything from these guys.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have long hair and style it with some wave to it.  I need to keep the frizz down and it gives me a smooth, shiny finish.  I put it on wet to style my hair.  Fantastic!  Great alternative to sticky, heavy gels.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it. I immediately ordered some for myself. It has great hold without making your hair &amp;#34;Crispy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This has been my go to product for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I used it years ago, geiiimg it from the salon that I used at the time.  Lately I found a small amount left and decided that I really liked it &amp; would go online &amp; search for it which I did &amp; found it on Amazon!  It&#x27;s just as great as ever!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. It was used on my hair at a hair salon and Iiked it so much that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price. My sister uses this and she was complaining that she was out of it and couldn&#x27;t find any locally. I saw this two pack and bought it for her. She said the price was great - she usually pays much more per tube. As I don&#x27;t use the product, all I can say is that my curly haired sister swears by it and says no other styling product tames and defines her curls like Rusk Wired,.Her hair always looked beautiful - shiny with defined curls and never stiff.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping and as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Best thing i put in my hair</li>
            <li> Great product... Buy it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was ecstatic to see this so fairly priced here as opposed to what I paid previously at CVS.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Truly, this stuff is awesome. I feel like I AM styling when my head is full of wired. All of this time I&#x27;ve been advocating wireless, but my world has been changed. I used the product a few years ago and cannot believe I didn&#x27;t buy it again until now. What was I thinking? Oh well, I&#x27;m back and I&#x27;m delighted to be Wired.</li>
