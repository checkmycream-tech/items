            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, which I can&#x27;t explain, it worked great this time!  </li>
            <li>But for whatever reason, it&#x27;s working now, lol!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for men and women who want control without tell-tale product look.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s seriously, excellent - and I&#x27;m just sticking with this brand!!  :D  </li>
            <li>Incredible!</li>
            <li>It is the BEST voluminizer - applies beautifully and leaves hear silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Great product and smells good!!</li>
            <li>The rest of the products from them work great, so I bought it again to give it the ol&#x27; college try.</li>
            <li>Works great, just remember,</li>
            <li>Not as great as I had hoped to give my wavy hair texture and volume.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this after watching a youtube video (Dominque Sache) for the perfect volumious blowout and I am so glad</li>
            <li>I love how this adds volume to hair and am very happy I can purchase on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I put this on after drying my hair and it looks like I have more hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more today!  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so popular at the moment.  </li>
            <li>When I warm it in my hands, the product doesn&#x27;t become transparent, like the directions say, but it does become more pliable and therefore easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love this living proof texture volumizer, it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>So glad I did</li>
            <li>I guess it is ok</li>
            <li>I love a lot of the Living Proof hair products.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel - thicker and with more body.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay, just not the miracle I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I will use the rest of it but will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li>I do better with Efora.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I can use it for so many things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this til it&#x27;s gone, but unless I find the perfect touch, I&#x27;ll be going back to the thickening cream.</li>
            <li>feel so much better about my hair.  </li>
            <li>This really works and gives your hair great volume if you follow the directions, avoids that helmet look and gives you more of a tousled look</li>
            <li>Pretty good at making my hair appear fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the hair gets all the volume I need.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best and most versatile styling/ molding cream if you want it to add texture and enhance finish without a stiff or sticky fix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with short-to-medium length fine hair</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that has no body.  </li>
            <li>less is best!</li>
            <li>Great for short styles.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gives it great body, a solid matte finish hold</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite product for styling my pixie cut.</li>
            <li>So far this morning I&#x27;ve got nice full hair with volume and zero hairspray.</li>
            <li>I can tell it adds volume, but it wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>So, even though I loved it 100% - a teensy bit goes a LONG way</li>
            <li>I did like how there was a small booklet that was very informative on using the product and to get the best results.</li>
            <li>When my hair is dry, I applied this stuff and it created a gorgeous tousled &#x27;do that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I have medium-length, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>A year, and who knows how many products later I tried again, coating the ends of my fingers and lightly working it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product just use very little or hair gets super oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find the right amount (</li>
            <li>to use on my short, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Followed instructions, product gave at first a lift, gone almost right away.  </li>
            <li>But you want height or a certain shape and form - you got it!  </li>
            <li>I received exactly what I needed in two days.</li>
            <li>many similar products seem to have</li>
            <li>If you want this product a bit more intensified, just rub it between fingers for a bit before applying- creates a dryer and tacky texture for extra hold.</li>
            <li>Love it although I do find I have to wash my hair the next day because my hair gets oily from it.</li>
            <li>but it did work pretty well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m willing to invest in.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>I have tried several texturizing sprays (Fructis Texture Tease, Sexy Hair Spray Clay, Beyond the Zone Vamped Up) but they are not designed to be used on the root area and therefore don&#x27;t really create volume.  </li>
            <li>have hair past butt all one length and need to cut some long layers to get best bene from this</li>
            <li>At first I thought it worked really well, then I used it again and it didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>I went with no hairspray today and have a nice tousled look with a few twists of a hot iron.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for this product to make your hair feel fuller.  </li>
            <li>, i do not see much difference in my hair with this product</li>
            <li>I used this texturizer a couple of times but didn&#x27;t get much of the promised volume.  </li>
            <li>and then to work it into the roots really well.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work with my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I need to reapply but can&#x27;t because its way too much.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have as much luck as they did on TV</li>
            <li>I much prefer Aveda&#x27;s Defining Whip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this product because it definitely lasted all day and into the next and because it takes such a small amount to make a huge impact.  </li>
            <li>Much better than any other pomades and gels I have used before.</li>
            <li>I then tried to use a little more of the product, a nickle sized dab, and got some decent results for the first time.</li>
            <li>The FULL shampoo/conditioner/thickening cream, I am big fans of.  </li>
            <li>have used Big Sexy volumizing and texturing powder before and that is a similar product but makes my roots greasy</li>
            <li>Works exactly as my older one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, too expensive to be ok, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I just ran a little bit more of the product through the root area to refresh my style.  </li>
            <li>my style needs to look current and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I used my first jar til it was bare.  </li>
            <li>Very different and useful for my think hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tested this product, I didn&#x27;t use enough.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that makes the claim that you can re-style later in the day with just your fingers</li>
            <li>I apply it to clean, dry, styled hair and, in addition to plumping up the root area, I also run what&#x27;s left on my hands through the midlengths and ends to create some grit and texture.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft not sticky.</li>
            <li>Really does add instant volume!!!</li>
            <li>When I woke up this morning, I still had a considerable amount of volume</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product.on the root area and therefore don&#x27;t really create volume.  </li>
            <li>either it&#x27;s not enough or, it&#x27;s too much</li>
            <li>I think the secret is to really warm it up in the palms of your hands until it&#x27;s an almost liquid consistency</li>
            <li>I tried the LIVING PROOF FULL THICKENING CREAM previously, and preferred it to this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money, and the size was a lot smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought this at Ulta a few months ago and recently ran out.</li>
            <li>I have barely shoulder length layered hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My style lasted all day.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t provide enough volumizing in my opinion for my fine but thick short hair.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this product two stars, because after a few tries, I couldn&#x27;t make it work.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair but made it a little shinier.  </li>
            <li>but  I bought it for that upcoming cut to use after I have all other mousse and thickengin cream and cannot live with out it , ever</li>

            <li> have also used various dry shampoos for volume and to extend my blowout</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost about 75% of my hair volume over the last 12 years due to health issues and now my hair is short</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long today&#x27;s style lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a replacement for Pureology&#x27;s Texture Twist, which was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> that tousled, casual, free form look</li>
            <li> little amount of this volumizer goes a long way and helps my blowout to last for several days.</li>
            <li> I have extended the time between washes from every other day to every third day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed results using this product on my long, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I can dampen my hair in the shower but not get completely wet, and redry with the hair dryer to freshen it up.  </li>
            <li> I think if I didn&#x27;t get my hair wet</li>
            <li> My one major criticism is that it&#x27;s rather sticky, so you really only want to use a very small amount, or it can cause little knots to form.</li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> because not only was it a few dollars cheaper, it was also on prime!</li>
            <li> I have also have 2 other products from the line and like them all.</li>
            <li> , I just figured, let me try a couple other products.  </li>
            <li> like I noticed other brands do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again, but I can see how it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron to create loose waves and then run my fingers through the curls to loosen them a little bit and to achieve the beachy look.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the effort or the cost.</li>
            <li> I think this product is intended for people who don&#x27;t wash or get their hair wet everyday.  </li>
            <li> I do get my hair wet everyday</li>
            <li> My hair just turns out greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weight my hair down or darken it.  </li>
            <li> I had jonathan DIRT before which was way less pliable and this does allow you to brush through it after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre product, not the worst I&#x27;ve had but not the best.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be a little gummy.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work for what I need to do with my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but it completely delivers everything it promises to do.</li>
            <li> made my hair limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> I also had terrible trouble with having a &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;, and that seems to be better, too.  </li>

            <li> Gives me volume in all the right places and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad texture in my medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> Adds lots of texture with very little product.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff everyday!</li>
            <li> If you have thin, limp hair, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It give s my thin and limp hair body</li>
            <li> and my hair gets weighed down, and looks dirty.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid of weighing down my ultra-fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The positive is that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell or sticky residue</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product drying, sticky.  Used as directed, my hair was stiffened and lost shine</li>
            <li> I love this living proof texture volumizer, it does what it says it will do. My hair feels soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this did nothing for my hair. Returning.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a youtube video (Dominque Sache) for the perfect volumious blowout and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Big Sexy volumizing and texturing powder before and that is a similar product but makes my roots greasy and I end up with flat hair over time.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used various dry shampoos for volume and to extend my blowout but they do not last as long as this product.&lt;br /&gt;A little amount of this volumizer goes a long way and helps my blowout to last for several days. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this at Ulta a few months ago and recently ran out. I checked 3 different Ulta stores before I decided to look for it on Amazon, instead. So glad I did because not only was it a few dollars cheaper, it was also on prime! I received exactly what I needed in two days. Works exactly as my older one. Gives me volume in all the right places and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad texture in my medium thick hair. Gives me just enough oomph without making my hair frizzy or poofy.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it thank you</li>
            <li> I love how this adds volume to hair and am very happy I can purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much for this product to make your hair feel fuller.  So it will last a long time.  I have also have 2 other products from the line and like them all.</li>
            <li> Horrible Product.  Have been trying to use it for a month to get volume with no result at all.  Actually gave it away, and it also has a very unpleasant odor.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Not worth the effort or the cost.</li>
            <li> I guess it is ok, i do not see much difference in my hair with this product but i still use it</li>
            <li> I love a lot of the Living Proof hair products. This one is the best for the tousled hair look.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love the way it makes my hair feel - thicker and with more body.  If you have thin, limp hair, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this product! Really does add instant volume!!!</li>
            <li> Works well use sparingly</li>
            <li> Terrible  - does nothing but make hair greasy</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair has texture and volume...will get this again</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the T, but this stuff did nothing to my hair. I then tried to use a little more of the product, a nickle sized dab, and got some decent results for the first time. I also read somewhere that you want your hair to lift the product off you hands and with that amount I could feel it happening. I actually bought this product at Ulta and returned it a week later. The rest of the products from them work great, so I bought it again to give it the ol&#x27; college try. So far this morning I&#x27;ve got nice full hair with volume and zero hairspray. We&#x27;ll see how long today&#x27;s style lasts. I have barely shoulder length layered hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My style lasted all day. I went with no hairspray today and have a nice tousled look with a few twists of a hot iron.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, just not the miracle I was hoping for.  The positive is that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell or sticky residue many similar products seem to have but it didn&#x27;t provide enough volumizing in my opinion for my fine but thick short hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good at making my hair appear fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this texturizer a couple of times but didn&#x27;t get much of the promised volume.  However, I didn&#x27;t return it to Sephora so I tried it again yesterday.  For some reason, which I can&#x27;t explain, it worked great this time!  I think the secret is to really warm it up in the palms of your hands until it&#x27;s an almost liquid consistency and then to work it into the roots really well.  Today, it added tons of volume which lasted all day.  To revive it, I only needed to run my hands through the root area, which recreates the lift at the roots.  I have below shoulder length hair so I used a dollop about the size of a nickel.  When I warm it in my hands, the product doesn&#x27;t become transparent, like the directions say, but it does become more pliable and therefore easier to work with.  I apply it to clean, dry, styled hair and, in addition to plumping up the root area, I also run what&#x27;s left on my hands through the midlengths and ends to create some grit and texture.  When I woke up this morning, I still had a considerable amount of volume and I just ran a little bit more of the product through the root area to refresh my style.  I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty or oily.  I use a curling iron to create loose waves and then run my fingers through the curls to loosen them a little bit and to achieve the beachy look.  This product instantly gives me the texture and oomph my style needs to look current and fresh.  It gives me instant bedhead, that tousled, casual, free form look that&#x27;s so popular at the moment.  I&#x27;m impressed with this product because it definitely lasted all day and into the next and because it takes such a small amount to make a huge impact.  I originally gave this product two stars, because after a few tries, I couldn&#x27;t make it work.  But for whatever reason, it&#x27;s working now, lol!  I have tried several texturizing sprays (Fructis Texture Tease, Sexy Hair Spray Clay, Beyond the Zone Vamped Up) but they are not designed to be used on the root area and therefore don&#x27;t really create volume.  Amp is definitely a volumizer and whatever product is left on my hands after applying it to the roots, I scrunch through the midlengths and ends to add some texture.  So based on my experience yesterday, I&#x27;m now giving this product four stars.  If it continues to work well for me, I will update this review and change it to five stars.  If you want volume at the root area, then this is the product for you.  But don&#x27;t expect it to become transparent like the directions say.  I don&#x27;t know if my previous negative experience with this product was a fluke or not, I only know that it&#x27;s working well for me now.  I definitely recommend this product.on the root area and therefore don&#x27;t really create volume.

            <li> It is the BEST voluminizer - applies beautifully and leaves hear silky and manageable.  No clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Wished it was sold in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Much better than any other pomades and gels I have used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, too expensive to be ok, in my opinion. I will use the rest of it but will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Perfect for men and women who want control without tell-tale product look. Great for short styles.  Can be used with longer hair, applied only at the roots.  A staple in our house</li>
            <li> Followed instructions, product gave at first a lift, gone almost right away.  The entire line of Living Proof that I&#x27;ve tried does nothing for my hair.  I do better with Efora.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;OUTSTANDING RESULTS</li>
            <li> This is easily the best and most versatile styling/ molding cream if you want it to add texture and enhance finish without a stiff or sticky fix. Love it and I can use it for so many things. If you want this product a bit more intensified, just rub it between fingers for a bit before applying- creates a dryer and tacky texture for extra hold.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair but made it a little shinier.  Doesn&#x27;t look like Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It give s my thin and limp hair body</li>
            <li> The best hair cream I&#x27;ve used.  It is not sticky or heavy but holds very well.</li>
            <li> I tried the LIVING PROOF FULL THICKENING CREAM previously, and preferred it to this.  I&#x27;m trying to find the right amount (just a little dab&#x27;ll do ya!) to use on my short, very fine hair.  Seems like either it&#x27;s not enough or, it&#x27;s too much and my hair gets weighed down, and looks dirty.  I&#x27;ll use this til it&#x27;s gone, but unless I find the perfect touch, I&#x27;ll be going back to the thickening cream.</li>
            <li> The first time I tested this product, I didn&#x27;t use enough.  I was afraid of weighing down my ultra-fine, thin hair.  A year, and who knows how many products later I tried again, coating the ends of my fingers and lightly working it through my hair.  I am now a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel so much better about my hair.  I can dampen my hair in the shower but not get completely wet, and redry with the hair dryer to freshen it up.  I have extended the time between washes from every other day to every third day. I also had terrible trouble with having a &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;, and that seems to be better, too.  I am using no hairspray.  My husband has told me three times in the last week that I look &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;.  Believe me, that is unheard of!  I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair alot of volume!  Love it although I do find I have to wash my hair the next day because my hair gets oily from it.</li>
            <li> Thinner consistacny and I tired it I had jonathan DIRT before which was way less pliable and this does allow you to brush through it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair past butt all one length and need to cut some long layers to get best bene from this but  I bought it for that upcoming cut to use after I have all other mousse and thickengin cream and cannot live with out it , ever</li>
            <li> Use this stuff everyday!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product. Did not preform as advertised&lt;br /&gt;https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid&#x3D;780825168594484&amp;id&#x3D;100000010232451</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really work with my hair.  made my hair feel dirty and didn&#x27;t give it any more body.</li>
            <li> I think this product is intended for people who don&#x27;t wash or get their hair wet everyday.  I do get my hair wet everyday so I need to reapply but can&#x27;t because its way too much.  My hair just turns out greasy and weighed down.  I think if I didn&#x27;t get my hair wet then I could just get up and restyle the next day without reapplying the product.  This just doesn&#x27;t work for what I need to do with my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this stuff. I&#x27;m a guy with short-to-medium length fine hair so using more oil based products usually leaves it very limp and lifeless. This stuff gives it great body, a solid matte finish hold and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that makes the claim that you can re-style later in the day with just your fingers and it will go back in place - no additional product required. This is 100% the case for me with this.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite product for styling my pixie cut.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product. I have baby fine hair that has no body.  I put this on after drying my hair and it looks like I have more hair! It does not weight my hair down or darken it.  I put a dime size drop in the palm of my hands, rub it to spread on my hands and then spread it through my hair!  I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Adds lots of texture with very little product. Works every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be a little gummy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have as much luck as they did on TV but it did work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works great, just remember, less is best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of boosting/texturizing products.  I bought this on a whim when I was splurging for the shampoo and condition because I was feeling desperate.  I&#x27;ve lost about 75% of my hair volume over the last 12 years due to health issues and now my hair is short and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m willing to invest in.  The FULL shampoo/conditioner/thickening cream, I am big fans of.  I&#x27;m going to buy more today!  This thickening cream, dang it&#x27;s expensive!  So, even though I loved it 100% - a teensy bit goes a LONG way, I just figured, let me try a couple other products.  Nah.  I used about a 1/4 of the two others I tried - I&#x27;m back to this one and I&#x27;m looking forward to it. I used my first jar til it was bare.  It lasted about 3 months, I used it daily.  It doesnt pull on your hair when you apply it, like I noticed other brands do.  But you want height or a certain shape and form - you got it!  It&#x27;s seriously, excellent - and I&#x27;m just sticking with this brand!!  :D  Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did like how there was a small booklet that was very informative on using the product and to get the best results. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money, and the size was a lot smaller than expected. I can tell it adds volume, but it wears off fairly quickly. Within a few hours. It&#x27;s a mediocre product, not the worst I&#x27;ve had but not the best.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I had hoped to give my wavy hair texture and volume.  I much prefer Aveda&#x27;s Defining Whip.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a replacement for Pureology&#x27;s Texture Twist, which was discontinued.  This one is not it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the hair gets all the volume I need. Very different and useful for my think hair.</li>
            <li> Great product just use very little or hair gets super oily</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but it completely delivers everything it promises to do. I have medium-length, fine, straight hair. When my hair is dry, I applied this stuff and it created a gorgeous tousled &#x27;do that lasted all day. Incredible! Definitely check out the tutorials on Living Proof&#x27;s website so you can see how to use the product correctly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, gave my hair a lot of volume for my fine hair.  Will re-order again  Can not do without.</li>
            <li> made my hair limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> This really works and gives your hair great volume if you follow the directions, avoids that helmet look and gives you more of a tousled look</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Rub in hands then apply to short hair roots up, then style. Can be revived at night or next day without reapplying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed results using this product on my long, slightly wavy hair. At first I thought it worked really well, then I used it again and it didn&#x27;t work so well. Maybe it depends on the weather/humidity, or maybe my hair is just too long/heavy. My one major criticism is that it&#x27;s rather sticky, so you really only want to use a very small amount, or it can cause little knots to form. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again, but I can see how it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells good!!</li>
