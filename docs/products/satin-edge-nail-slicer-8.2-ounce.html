            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon.</li>
            <li>a lot could not ask for any thing better</li>
            <li>works great on new acrylic tips...haven&#x27;t tried it while acrylic on the tip as of yet</li>
            <li>Withstand sanitizing easily.</li>
            <li>They cut through the nails easily and without bending or cracking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very easy to use</li>
            <li>I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li>As the title says, it doesn&#x27;t really give a good, clean cut.</li>
            <li>This cuts through arcilics just fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth edges, no fragments, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but you can feel how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>Every cut is precise and even.  </li>
            <li>Great for DIY fixes instead of having to run back to the shop.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
            <li>I have had no issues and the cuts are clean</li>
            <li>It is very precise in clipping and works very well.</li>
            <li>My large toe nail clippers work alot better.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very effective, and sharp!  </li>
            <li>The shipment was sent before the deliver date which was cool.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>but if I were to do it again I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a pair that really works.</li>
            <li>I would have liked if it cut the artificial nails more smoothly, but with a file, my nails look great.</li>
            <li>but it seems to make my nails peel much more than normal.</li>
            <li>OK for me because I am new to doing acrylics anyways.</li>
            <li>The slicer cuts clean and was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Also my daughter found these on ebay for .99 cents free shipping, so I paid way to much for something I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>Worth what you pay for them, anyway.</li>
            <li>It works good and is sharp.</li>
            <li>Leaves clean edges that file down nicely.  </li>
            <li>so thank you very much</li>
            <li>If you are interested in buying a set of these then this is the one you should buy.</li>
            <li>Leaves nails even and is better than regular nail clipper</li>
            <li>I love this because it simply feels sturdier than the one I had.</li>
            <li>stron not cheap good quality</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a great description and had I known this was primarily for artificial nails</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Not too upset as it was very inexpensive</li>
            <li>This cuts through acrylics like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to let my acrylics go and let my natural nails come back for awhile, and didn&#x27;t want to pay to have them removed or filed back in the meanwhile, or get another set, so I got this instead to trim them back as the nail grew out, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>your feet are less likely to feel good.</li>
            <li>I just make sure that I cut them a bit above what I actually want them to be at, though -</li>
            <li>It slices the nail adequately but I wish it cut the nail into an oval shape or that it left the nail edges smoother.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on frequent use, but it&#x27;s certainly more than adequate for casual use at home.</li>
            <li>That is all that I have tried them on so far.</li>
            <li>they cut good seem to be really sharp not too bad on leaving a smooth edge.</li>
            <li>It is worth it to buy a more expensive product!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly to cut my grandmother&#x27;s very long, thick fingernails while alleviating any concern of cutting skin with her nails, since she&#x27;s very jumpy.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as sturdy and sharp as they once were, but have held up reasonably well for how often I use them and the price.</li>
            <li>do think this would work great for clipping artificial nails down to size</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for tough nails or ingrown toenails.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> do think this would work great for clipping artificial nails down to size</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for tough nails or ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, this will do a good job of cutting the nails to any desired length but leaves nails in a square-ish shape rather than oval and will leave edges rough.</li>
            <li> This is sharp but after about 4 full manicures it started sticking and is hard to cut with.</li>
            <li> It works, just barely and not very well.</li>
            <li> The blade is dull and I have to file several mm off to make it look normal.</li>
            <li> People often forget how important it is to take care of nails, especially toenails, but if your nails are ingrown or generally unpleasant</li>
            <li> little cracks the clippers might have left fixes that.</li>
            <li> The blade is not properly cut, and there is a protrusion that leaves that nail unevenly cut.</li>
            <li> My daughter finally figured it out but said to much trouble to use.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> been using them for months now, with no real issues.</li>
            <li> a second of filing it down past any jaggedness/</li>
            <li> down-</li>
            <li> Also works well to cut down tips before using acrylic or gel.</li>
            <li> It is much easier than cutting with clippers and filing alone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It just does not squeeze well and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> but it was slow comeing</li>
            <li> I was nervous about the quality, but ever since I&#x27;ve had it I have not experienced it getting stiff or anything.</li>
            <li> Ingrown toenails are never pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The nails I was using were a bit weak</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fast shipping amazing price , work  great</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing! they are a litting squeaky at times, but they cut soooo smoothly! I strongly reccomend these clippers!</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use for acrylic nails. That is all that I have tried them on so far. It makes doing acrylic nails a lot easier. If you are interested in buying a set of these then this is the one you should buy. It works great in my opinion. It shipped fairly quick and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This cuts through acrylics like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to let my acrylics go and let my natural nails come back for awhile, and didn&#x27;t want to pay to have them removed or filed back in the meanwhile, or get another set, so I got this instead to trim them back as the nail grew out, and it worked great.  No split nails, nice smooth cuts.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> This nail slicer was everything I was hoping for.  Every cut is precise and even.  The shipment was sent before the deliver date which was cool.  I was nervous about the quality, but ever since I&#x27;ve had it I have not experienced it getting stiff or anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was the way to go for trimming my artifcial nail. I had seen them used in salons and wanted to try it. Wish I hadn&#x27;t. My large toe nail clippers work alot better. These tend to cause my nail to split, not so with the toe nail clippers. Also my daughter found these on ebay for .99 cents free shipping, so I paid way to much for something I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a great description and had I known this was primarily for artificial nails I don&#x27;t think I would have bought it. I have used it but it seems to make my nails peel much more than normal. It would also be nice if there was instructions. It took me trial and error to figure out which way to put my nail in for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really only worked for me if I wanted to cut my nail way down- but I still had to take time to shape it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this would work great for clipping artificial nails down to size - I just don&#x27;t need it for that application.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  Easy to use, very effective, and sharp!  Leaves clean edges that file down nicely.  Great for DIY fixes instead of having to run back to the shop.  I can&#x27;t comment on frequent use, but it&#x27;s certainly more than adequate for casual use at home.</li>
            <li> works great on new acrylic tips...haven&#x27;t tried it while acrylic on the tip as of yet</li>
            <li> Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!</li>
            <li> As the title says, it doesn&#x27;t really give a good, clean cut. I just make sure that I cut them a bit above what I actually want them to be at, though - a second of filing it down past any jaggedness/little cracks the clippers might have left fixes that.

            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT LAST YEAR FOR MY BEST FRIEND AND SHE LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and just like the nail shop. I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this nail slicer. I am beginning to do my own nails (acrylics) at home and this was the perfect price for my budget as I did not want to spend a ton of money for something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to continue to do. The slicer cuts clean and was very reasonably priced. The beauty supply store charges double for the same product. I&#x27;d recommend this slicer for beginners.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Use these daily. Withstand sanitizing easily. Shipping was quick and packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> stron not cheap good quality</li>
            <li> I would have liked if it cut the artificial nails more smoothly, but with a file, my nails look great. It is much easier than cutting with clippers and filing alone.</li>

            <li> These were a great price and they work perfectly for trimming my acrylic tips. They cut through the nails easily and without bending or cracking. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great tool and does the job it was created for.</li>
            <li> It slices the nail adequately but I wish it cut the nail into an oval shape or that it left the nail edges smoother. The nails I was using were a bit weak so I got this cos I didn&#x27;t want to file them. Still ended up doing so. In conclusion, this will do a good job of cutting the nails to any desired length but leaves nails in a square-ish shape rather than oval and will leave edges rough.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time, they cut like they are suppose to, and they are good quality. Can&#x27;t get much better cutters than that.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for tough nails or ingrown toenails.  Ingrown toenails are never pleasant.  If you suffer from them repeatedly then you know you need to do something about it.  This nail slicer is great for taking care of the problem.  Just soak the foot, then use this nail slicer along with a [[ASIN:B000VDAFHE Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File]] and [[ASIN:B000VDFKLK Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter]] to take care of the problem.  People often forget how important it is to take care of nails, especially toenails, but if your nails are ingrown or generally unpleasant your feet are less likely to feel good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make home manicures easier! It did no such thing. The blade is not properly cut, and there is a protrusion that leaves that nail unevenly cut. The blade is dull and I have to file several mm off to make it look normal. Don&#x27;t waste your money! It is worth it to buy a more expensive product!</li>
            <li> This item was just what i needed for my nail kit. I enjoy using it. It is very precise in clipping and works very well.</li>
            <li> This cuts through arcilics just fine. I have had no issues and the cuts are clean which is very nice</li>
            <li> I got this because my daughter does my nails at home. Had a heck of a time trying to&lt;br /&gt;figure out how to use.  My daughter finally figured it out but said to much trouble to use.&lt;br /&gt;Went back to nail clippers.</li>
            <li> This product does what its supposed to do. It slices through nails perfectly. Leaves nails even and is better than regular nail clipper</li>
            <li> love how i can just clip my nail the size i want it with just one step&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use</li>
            <li> they cut good seem to be really sharp not too bad on leaving a smooth edge. a length guide would be nice</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase works nicely. Price is incredible this worked as well as higer priced Nail Slicers. Would highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Arrived and the clippers as just as described, will update when I&#x27;ve had a chance to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using them for months now, with no real issues. They aren&#x27;t as sturdy and sharp as they once were, but have held up reasonably well for how often I use them and the price.</li>
            <li> This clips better than in the salon, very smooth and no chips.  Smooth edges, no fragments, easy to use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It works fine, but you can feel how cheap it is. OK for me because I am new to doing acrylics anyways.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I had that had snapped one day. I love this because it simply feels sturdier than the one I had. My worry of it also snapping was greatly reduced just in handling it.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> This is sharp but after about 4 full manicures it started sticking and is hard to cut with. It just does not squeeze well and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> awsome works good i like it a lot could not ask for any thing better so thank you very much but it was slow comeing</li>
