            <li>This thing shortens the time by a great deal and it is very easy to use!  </li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>Use your own hair dryer and avoid frizzy flyaways!</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good for drying and conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Really good value.</li>
            <li>The bonnet fit perfectly over my 3&amp;#34; jumbo curlers&lt;br /&gt;(those purple ones).</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This attachment fit on my blow dryer and head perfectly with any hiccups.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product sometime ago for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the dryer and the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, this is very cheap!</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item, it is nicely made, good material and handy pouch for storage included.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much better than having to sleep in curl formers!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find one that I could travel with easily.  </li>
            <li>But this one is easy to travel with and store and from what i can tell I&#x27;m getting great heat distribution all over my head too.</li>
            <li>Some commented that it gets hot -- its best to use a hair dryer with a warm setting as well</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and practical, but st of all at good price.</li>
            <li>and I have amazing damage-free curls in around 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and very well made</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on my conair infinity pro dryer.</li>
            <li>But once it was on it held nicely.</li>
            <li>I had almost given up on styling my own hair until I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is true that the heat distribution isn&#x27;t great, so</li>
            <li>amazing very innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it would be nice if the air came from the top of the cap, too, so</li>
            <li>Love this handy dryer cap.</li>
            <li>More effective just blasting my hair to set it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love it !</li>
            <li>Easily used and portable it is an amazing product and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and convenient as well and allows easy concealed storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Love this portable hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This hooded dryer is just ok because It didn&#x27;t stay on my head even though I had adjusted the straps under my chin, it just didn&#x27;t stay put on my head.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I had to hold the top of the hooded dryer to my head so it want blow off my head.</li>
            <li>I will keep it and try more often and update if it gets better</li>
            <li>I was concerned about it fitting over all of my hair wrapped in Curlformers</li>
            <li>This is actually a fantastic piece of equipment!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it fits perfectly over all 5 of my blow dryers which are all different sizes.</li>
            <li>Once again I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using Curlformers to curl my hair but</li>
            <li>This is the most convenient hair dryer ever.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer because I wanted something that allowed for more flexibility in moving around while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li>and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li>Had no problems fitting over the nozzle of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this I had purchased two</li>
            <li>but I still love this product.</li>
            <li>The elastic band fit on my blow dryer without falling off!</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly over my blow dryer and I use for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it would be even better for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I was actually better of just blow drying and using my straightner .</li>
            <li>I quit using my curling iron to curl my hair and switched to using spiral foam rollers, which I love.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as a hood dryer and it fits most blow dryers.</li>
            <li>It needs a better staying mechanism though.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy two more just in case or if the manufacturer should stop making these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It dose it&#x27;s job so 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Most hotels have hair dryers that can be attached to the hood hose.  </li>
            <li>did notice that the heat tends to work more the bottom-back, since that&#x27;s where the hose feeds into, so I turned it upside-down for 10 min so that the top-front could get more heat.</li>
            <li>Trying to keep the blow dryer attached was challenging.</li>
            <li>This is okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I also had to re-position the hood throughout the process so that heat was evenly distributed to my hair, but that&#x27;s still so much better than holding up a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and always wait until the last minute to style your hair this will be your best friend.</li>
            <li>more</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to sit under a hot dryer!!!</li>
            <li>Well, is not the Best, it gets reallt hot and it moves on my head while am drying my hair, dont really like it.</li>
            <li>I need to keep switching from cool and warm.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, convenient.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair pretty good.</li>
            <li>Some minor improvements could make this product excellent.</li>
            <li>Good for hot oil treatments, conditioners and curl formers</li>
            <li>It works fine, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do the best job, not like a traditional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>This is the best product that I have used to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it easy to use and a space saver not like my hooded dryer</li>
            <li>This dryer is much better because I&#x27;m able to sit on my couch and comfortably watch TV while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li>I did NOT think the sound or the heat was unbearable--it was all very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt this successfully dries hair.</li>
            <li>although I have not tried but very good material, solid and seems to resist .</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer but even on warm setting it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I would like this a lot more if it fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will fit anyone else&#x27;s head even with rollers, curlformers or whatever else.</li>
            <li>For the price this a great soft bonnet.</li>
            <li>it fit very comfortable over my head and had a strap that fit under your chin to keep the bonnet attached while it was drying your hair.</li>
            <li>it makes it super easy to take with you when traveling!  </li>
            <li>Fixes perfectly on head due to</li>
            <li>so it was easy to pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pack away.</li>
            <li>It was easy to attach to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy storage.</li>
            <li>When this one was cheaper and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>If I have to move around, the hose easily comes off.</li>
            <li>It seems to be made with care, of quality materials, and the zipper pouch makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li>It comes with its own little pouch - good for traveling!</li>
            <li>It works fine, it&#x27;s easy to put on, but it doesn&#x27;t save time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and this is sure to be a good laugh for any partners/roommates/children/boyfriends/relatives who live with you!</li>
            <li>It fit well over my hairdryer and is extremely easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I do use medium heat and its worked fine.</li>
            <li>It kind of freaked me out, but with a little help and a lot of pulling it tighter I was able to use it without it successfully flying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and after much trial and error I&#x27;ve found the best way to style it on hair-washing days is to blow it dry (without this cap), then put it in velcro hair rollers, spritz the rollers lightly with water, then sit under this contraption for about 20 minutes, switching between air and medium heat.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly with my dryer, and although I feel my dryer is much weaker than other brands, it does an excellent job in low setting in combination with this bonnet.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting use to, if you don&#x27;t pull the drawstrings correctly you&#x27;ll have a huge hole where they meet and all your air will escape.</li>
            <li>The drawstrings didn&#x27;t fasten the hood securely and it kept blowing off my head.  </li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t fit over my conair blow dryer (measures 8 inches around the nozzle) but I found a way to make it work.</li>
            <li>Great for Oil or Deep Conditioners!</li>
            <li>As an added bonus it&#x27;s hilarious looking, you will laugh when you put this on.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Fit over 2 inch Velcro rollers with no problem and freed my hands up</li>
            <li>Great even with recommended use of low heat.</li>
            <li>My curls look just as great using this instead of air drying, and I only use it for 15-20 minutes while I put my make up</li>
            <li>The elasticized end makes it fit almost any blow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too cheap and don&#x27;t have the space for a pro hooded dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair was dry in no time and the curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li>For the price, this item is very useful.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this urchse thinking it would free my hands  while I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>It works effortlessly with almost any kind of hand dryer and doesn&#x27;t take too long to warm up.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer worked great, even though the shape of the &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34; is a bit strange.  </li>
            <li>I love the concept and it doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li>so i spend most of the drying time trying to keep the hot air off of my skin.  </li>
            <li>SO worth the money!</li>
            <li>Time saving compact little zipper pouch to store couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a great product.</li>
            <li>After much struggling, I was able to attach it but the pull string didn&#x27;t seem to secure it sufficiently onto my head..</li>
            <li>So far I really love this product!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product because I am NOT a fan of overhead dryers.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer attachment you can get so much done while using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for deep conditioning</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it on the cool setting to set in curls.  </li>
            <li>I have type 3A curls (mildly thick, Caucasian hair, no color treatment and mostly using Deva Curl products) and this provides me with a great shape that I can&#x27;t get with my diffuser or with air drying.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly evenly.  </li>
            <li>The airflow is really strong at the bottom but at the sides and top you can barely feel any air coming out..</li>
            <li>It gets very hot even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>My hair came out beautiful a mass of controllable curls and was completely dried.</li>
            <li>This did the trick, quick and easy and very affordable.</li>
            <li>however it fit comfortably and was able to do its job giving my soft bouncy curls in a reasonable amount of drying time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to travel with and store and it gets the job done very efficiently.</li>
            <li>However, for the price, I would say this item is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did not throw out my old bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
            <li>fun trying to keep it on your head</li>
            <li>I could also see this being useful when putting your hair in velcro rollers.</li>
            <li>and they arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Now, I can get out of the shower, walk my dog or do things around the house until my hair is the right about of damp to put the rollers in, and then stick this on my head</li>
            <li>I do my hair every 4 days in headband curls and this works great for making sure they get dried all the way through if I decide to do them last minute instead of over night.</li>
            <li>and I knew my hair would take hours to dry on its own</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that this cap easily fit over large velcro rollers, and it could easily stand higher heat (from my dryer&#x27;s low setting) than I could, so I had to hit the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button on the blow dryer for comfort quite a few times.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what a hair dryer should do.</li>
            <li>Love it, I am a college student and don&#x27;t  have enough space or money to get a bulky hair dryer.</li>
            <li>diameter rollers for the top, back and sides.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand the heat from the blow dryer because it was too hot.</li>
            <li>I used the hair dryer for the first time  </li>
            <li>It soft, fairly comfortable, and efficient.</li>
            <li>First off, it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it four stars because it does have some hot spots.</li>
            <li>Because I have locs, the drying time is the same (more than 30 minutes to a hour or so): however, I rather sit under this than an overhead dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it mostly for deep conditioning treatments, what a difference!</li>
            <li>Does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li>I just turn it every 5-10 minutes so a different part of my head is getting most of the heat.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cute!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The first two times I tried to use it</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>I also like that this product can fit a child&#x27;s head or an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I initially brought a gold n hot dryer attachment cap and had issues with the cap fitting rods/rollers as well as staying on and distributing heat</li>
            <li>Complete and even heat coverage with comfortable wear</li>
            <li>I think because the instructions say use on warm and not hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use and extremely durable.</li>
            <li>I saw some people had trouble fitting it on their dryer, but it fit mine no problem.</li>
            <li>I always like to give positive reviews</li>
            <li>It pretty much fits just like pictured -</li>
            <li>It really makes the heating process so much easier!</li>
            <li>I do love this because I can pretty much do anything while letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>but I since most require you to air dry your hair</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t ex[ect that it will dry my hair more than serving as a steaming treatment.</li>
            <li>Quiet, easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>Seems like the air does not circulate to the front as well as in the back where hair easily dries.</li>
            <li>I bought this to dry my curly hair without touching it while it was drying.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure that your hair is completely dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durting operation even on high and the hottest setting the hood stays in place with zero interruption of hot air to my head.</li>
            <li>Higher quality items yield high results.vice</li>
            <li>Higher quality items yield high results.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed (I&#x27;m actually using it right now, which reminded me that I needed to write a review!).  </li>
            <li>On just the low setting, I experienced inconsistent heat, overheating and the dryer attachment did not easily fit.</li>
            <li>so too much air does not escape.</li>
            <li>When you put on the hood it is shaped like it was designed for Marge Simpson (hair that sticks straight up from your head).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly</li>
            <li>so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s takes much longer</li>
            <li>Better than expected</li>
            <li>I like it for travel very compact.  </li>
            <li>This was absolutely a disaster.</li>
            <li>Also, the drawing allows to much air to escape.</li>
            <li>Overheated and burned a whole through the material and through the couch.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li>and she was very content with it on her head.</li>
            <li>You simply adjust the fit.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I had to struggle to fit the opening of the Softhood around my dryer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants or needs a dryer.</li>
            <li>Since it was such a cheap dryer, I decided to upgrade and bought a Babyliss Pro Titanium blow dryer (2000 watt).</li>
            <li>I used this dryer 4 times so far, 3 times while traveling abroad and once at home before I left (to make sure it worked).  </li>
            <li>I used my old dryer,set it on low setting and it was more thanenough heat.</li>
            <li>Was excited to use because of the good reviews but did not work with my thick ,long hair.</li>
            <li>This attachment is large enough to fit all of the hair appendages I&#x27;ve tried this far.</li>
            <li>--mine is fine and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was interested in trying out some natural hairstyles</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been alternating between low and cool every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>You can rest your blow dryer down and use both your hands to type like what I am doing now :-).</li>
            <li>I am able to watch youtube while deep conditioning and the hot air is not particularly concentrated to one are like my steamer.</li>
            <li>CAN QUICKLY BURN YOUR HEAD, HAVE TO USE IT ON LOW HEAT</li>
            <li>looks decent.</li>
            <li>I suggest you have a hand held dryer with a low heat setting as it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take to high heat at the muzzle of the dryer after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the little case it comes in</li>
            <li>it relieves the scorching heat that comes with using an overhead dryer; however, I only see myself using this to set curls or for hot oil treatments!</li>
            <li>Clean fresh smelling year round fragrance.</li>
            <li>The drawstring and neck security are not very sturdy or comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like the portability of this bonnet hair dryer but even on low heat, my whole head was HOT.</li>
            <li>I dried my hair without me having to blow dry it so that was good.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot in the back, too hot, and not enough air reaches the front.  </li>
            <li>Im actually under it right now</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is nice and compact and it does dry my hair.</li>
            <li>The pink is extra cute.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly long, however, and I am pretty sure I can rectify this by putting slightly less hair in each roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not do an adequate job on my loose hair.</li>
            <li>It took so much longer to dry my hair than I was willing to wait.  </li>
            <li>or I have to add pillows (when the chair is too short) or find a higher surface (when the chair is too hair).</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have that actually stays on!</li>
            <li>and it came early!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and fairly easy way to dry hair, especially if coloring it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and it gets frizzy quickly if I use the hand held dryer to dry after shower, but with this it is similar to using a diffuser</li>
            <li>Worth every single coin.</li>
            <li>I also have a very large head (23&amp;#34;) and I was worried that my head would not fit into a hatbox/hard shell type hair dryer with hair rollers in.</li>
            <li>I normally use a soft-hood-dryer contraption that doesn&#x27;t require being hooked up to a blow-dryer -- and it has a better hood shape (its soft hood is ROUND so that it covers the front, sides and back of the head more evenly) than this one, but they both essentially produce the same results -- dry hair in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Because other viewers commented about the hot ears, I simply took my ears out from under the curl former and I was fine.</li>
            <li>It also is very hot, follow the instructions and only use the low setting.</li>
            <li>I was looking into buying a hood dryer for my room, which is expensive and very bulky, and I am so glad I found out about these!</li>
            <li>I needed it for large velcro curlers and there wasn&#x27;t enough room for air circulation.</li>
            <li>I can get up early in the AM and gave my hair styled and ready for the night by the afternoon instead of waiting all night for a next day style.</li>
            <li>It barely fit over my head when I had the curlformers in, and it did not fit over my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I usually start on Hot at Hi and if the air gets too hot, I switch to Hot at Low.</li>
            <li>and I can see why as I think it would probably melt the plastic tube near the hair</li>
            <li>Multiple adjustment sizes for the head and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The pressure of my blow-dryer set on low was way too much for this flimsy cap.</li>
            <li>This product was cheaply made and did not fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Although the description of the hood says It will fit any hair dryer, it did not fit mine.</li>
            <li>I have never used a soft hood attachment before</li>
            <li>but it still has stayed put so far.</li>
            <li>I will take this if I have to travel and need a bonnet since its very small and the accompanying pouch is adorable.</li>
            <li>Good item, a little too small for my head with all the curlers.</li>
            <li>It seems like the heat is highly concentrated at the back of my neck where the tube meets the bonnet.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for setting curls and not so much for drying long hair as if you were using a hand dryer.</li>
            <li>How long it will take really depends on your hair</li>
            <li>So I would say, when I start, my hair is very damp to damp, but usually not soaking wet when I put the rollers in.</li>
            <li>Wake up in morning, take shower letting steam absorb in hair, twist with a little product and flax gel and put this on while you are doing your make up etc... for 30 minutes and your twists will be dry and fresh  pretty twist or braid out.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>This dryer definitely gets the job done and it&#x27;s much more convenient than my hard bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>I then flipped my hair right side up and the cap kept sliding down my face.  </li>
            <li>I like morei can sit on the couch and dry my hair, I also enjoy the fact that it takes only 20-30 minutes to dry my hair than with a hooded dryer, it took a hour!</li>
            <li>No regrets on this one!</li>
            <li>I have a standard sized blow drier, but the hose on this is way too small to get it to fit around the nozzle of the blow drier.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the hose that needs to connect to the hairdryer is so small, that it won&#x27;t fit over my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The usual problems of tearing because its vinyl, adjusting to close (create a snug fit) a problem, or the actual hood blowing off my head because of the force of the dyer always made these gadgets cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fact that the soft hood actually stays on your head while in use.</li>
            <li>I had to go back to my old dryer.</li>
            <li>It works well for deep conditioning which is all I have used it for so far, but probably works well for roller setting too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I used it on my 2 1/2 year old on a low setting while she played on my iPad</li>
            <li>Finally a way to straighten my hair without direct heat.  </li>
            <li>It took about an hour to dry my hair with my hair dryer on high heat attached to this.</li>
            <li>Very Useful for college girl with small space and smaller budget!</li>
            <li>so I would suggest making sure you get the drawstring tight and then using the lower snaps on the strap to give yourself a little room to move around.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair fast enough though.</li>
            <li>Grab one of these at this very affordable price and wet, set, knot and curl to your hearts desire!</li>
            <li>I tried to use these on my locs and they would NOT dry.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot which makes the time spent shorter to get the hair dry.  </li>
            <li>every for those with full thick hair</li>
            <li>It comes with a great little zippered pouch for traveling/storing the device, which was small enough to take up very little room in my carry-on bag, and it was squishy</li>
            <li>It looks ridiculous, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>but when it provides nuch nicer curls than I was getting just letting my natural curls air dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extra step, not sure it&#x27;s worth it just yet.</li>
            <li>while under what I have come to jokingly call my &amp;#34;Bonnet of Beauty&amp;#34;)  My hair is tame and curled and the curls stay in.  </li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find one that I could travel with easily.  </li>
            <li> But this one is easy to travel with and store and from what i can tell I&#x27;m getting great heat distribution all over my head too.</li>
            <li> Some commented that it gets hot -- its best to use a hair dryer with a warm setting as well</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and practical, but st of all at good price.</li>
            <li> and I have amazing damage-free curls in around 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is perfect and very well made</li>
            <li> Fits nicely on my conair infinity pro dryer.</li>
            <li> But once it was on it held nicely.</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on styling my own hair until I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is true that the heat distribution isn&#x27;t great, so</li>
            <li> amazing very innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li> And it would be nice if the air came from the top of the cap, too, so</li>
            <li> Love this handy dryer cap.</li>
            <li> More effective just blasting my hair to set it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love it !</li>
            <li> Easily used and portable it is an amazing product and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and convenient as well and allows easy concealed storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love this portable hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This hooded dryer is just ok because It didn&#x27;t stay on my head even though I had adjusted the straps under my chin, it just didn&#x27;t stay put on my head.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I had to hold the top of the hooded dryer to my head so it want blow off my head.</li>
            <li> I will keep it and try more often and update if it gets better</li>
            <li> I was concerned about it fitting over all of my hair wrapped in Curlformers</li>
            <li> This is actually a fantastic piece of equipment!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it fits perfectly over all 5 of my blow dryers which are all different sizes.</li>
            <li> Once again I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using Curlformers to curl my hair but</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient hair dryer ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I wanted something that allowed for more flexibility in moving around while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li> and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li> Had no problems fitting over the nozzle of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this I had purchased two</li>
            <li> but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> The elastic band fit on my blow dryer without falling off!</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly over my blow dryer and I use for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it would be even better for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I was actually better of just blow drying and using my straightner .</li>
            <li> I quit using my curling iron to curl my hair and switched to using spiral foam rollers, which I love.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as a hood dryer and it fits most blow dryers.</li>
            <li> It needs a better staying mechanism though.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy two more just in case or if the manufacturer should stop making these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It dose it&#x27;s job so 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Most hotels have hair dryers that can be attached to the hood hose.  </li>
            <li> did notice that the heat tends to work more the bottom-back, since that&#x27;s where the hose feeds into, so I turned it upside-down for 10 min so that the top-front could get more heat.</li>
            <li> Trying to keep the blow dryer attached was challenging.</li>
            <li> This is okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I also had to re-position the hood throughout the process so that heat was evenly distributed to my hair, but that&#x27;s still so much better than holding up a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and always wait until the last minute to style your hair this will be your best friend.</li>
            <li> more</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to sit under a hot dryer!!!</li>
            <li> Well, is not the Best, it gets reallt hot and it moves on my head while am drying my hair, dont really like it.</li>
            <li> I need to keep switching from cool and warm.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, convenient.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair pretty good.</li>
            <li> Some minor improvements could make this product excellent.</li>
            <li> Good for hot oil treatments, conditioners and curl formers</li>
            <li> It works fine, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do the best job, not like a traditional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have used to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use and a space saver not like my hooded dryer</li>
            <li> This dryer is much better because I&#x27;m able to sit on my couch and comfortably watch TV while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li> I did NOT think the sound or the heat was unbearable--it was all very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt this successfully dries hair.</li>
            <li> although I have not tried but very good material, solid and seems to resist .</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer but even on warm setting it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I would like this a lot more if it fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will fit anyone else&#x27;s head even with rollers, curlformers or whatever else.</li>
            <li> For the price this a great soft bonnet.</li>
            <li> it fit very comfortable over my head and had a strap that fit under your chin to keep the bonnet attached while it was drying your hair.</li>
            <li> it makes it super easy to take with you when traveling!  </li>
            <li> Fixes perfectly on head due to</li>
            <li> so it was easy to pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pack away.</li>
            <li> It was easy to attach to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy storage.</li>
            <li> When this one was cheaper and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> If I have to move around, the hose easily comes off.</li>
            <li> It seems to be made with care, of quality materials, and the zipper pouch makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li> It comes with its own little pouch - good for traveling!</li>
            <li> It works fine, it&#x27;s easy to put on, but it doesn&#x27;t save time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and this is sure to be a good laugh for any partners/roommates/children/boyfriends/relatives who live with you!</li>
            <li> It fit well over my hairdryer and is extremely easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I do use medium heat and its worked fine.</li>
            <li> It kind of freaked me out, but with a little help and a lot of pulling it tighter I was able to use it without it successfully flying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and after much trial and error I&#x27;ve found the best way to style it on hair-washing days is to blow it dry (without this cap), then put it in velcro hair rollers, spritz the rollers lightly with water, then sit under this contraption for about 20 minutes, switching between air and medium heat.  </li>
            <li> It fit perfectly with my dryer, and although I feel my dryer is much weaker than other brands, it does an excellent job in low setting in combination with this bonnet.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to, if you don&#x27;t pull the drawstrings correctly you&#x27;ll have a huge hole where they meet and all your air will escape.</li>
            <li> The drawstrings didn&#x27;t fasten the hood securely and it kept blowing off my head.  </li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t fit over my conair blow dryer (measures 8 inches around the nozzle) but I found a way to make it work.</li>
            <li> Great for Oil or Deep Conditioners!</li>
            <li> As an added bonus it&#x27;s hilarious looking, you will laugh when you put this on.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Fit over 2 inch Velcro rollers with no problem and freed my hands up</li>
            <li> Great even with recommended use of low heat.</li>
            <li> My curls look just as great using this instead of air drying, and I only use it for 15-20 minutes while I put my make up</li>
            <li> The elasticized end makes it fit almost any blow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap and don&#x27;t have the space for a pro hooded dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry in no time and the curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li> For the price, this item is very useful.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this urchse thinking it would free my hands  while I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> It works effortlessly with almost any kind of hand dryer and doesn&#x27;t take too long to warm up.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked great, even though the shape of the &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34; is a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> I love the concept and it doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li> so i spend most of the drying time trying to keep the hot air off of my skin.  </li>
            <li> SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> Time saving compact little zipper pouch to store couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a great product.</li>
            <li> After much struggling, I was able to attach it but the pull string didn&#x27;t seem to secure it sufficiently onto my head..</li>
            <li> So far I really love this product!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product because I am NOT a fan of overhead dryers.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer attachment you can get so much done while using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it on the cool setting to set in curls.  </li>
            <li> I have type 3A curls (mildly thick, Caucasian hair, no color treatment and mostly using Deva Curl products) and this provides me with a great shape that I can&#x27;t get with my diffuser or with air drying.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly evenly.  </li>
            <li> The airflow is really strong at the bottom but at the sides and top you can barely feel any air coming out..</li>
            <li> It gets very hot even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> My hair came out beautiful a mass of controllable curls and was completely dried.</li>
            <li> This did the trick, quick and easy and very affordable.</li>
            <li> however it fit comfortably and was able to do its job giving my soft bouncy curls in a reasonable amount of drying time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to travel with and store and it gets the job done very efficiently.</li>
            <li> However, for the price, I would say this item is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did not throw out my old bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
            <li> fun trying to keep it on your head</li>
            <li> I could also see this being useful when putting your hair in velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> and they arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Now, I can get out of the shower, walk my dog or do things around the house until my hair is the right about of damp to put the rollers in, and then stick this on my head</li>
            <li> I do my hair every 4 days in headband curls and this works great for making sure they get dried all the way through if I decide to do them last minute instead of over night.</li>
            <li> and I knew my hair would take hours to dry on its own</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that this cap easily fit over large velcro rollers, and it could easily stand higher heat (from my dryer&#x27;s low setting) than I could, so I had to hit the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button on the blow dryer for comfort quite a few times.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what a hair dryer should do.</li>
            <li> Love it, I am a college student and don&#x27;t  have enough space or money to get a bulky hair dryer.</li>
            <li> diameter rollers for the top, back and sides.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the heat from the blow dryer because it was too hot.</li>
            <li> I used the hair dryer for the first time  </li>
            <li> It soft, fairly comfortable, and efficient.</li>
            <li> First off, it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it four stars because it does have some hot spots.</li>
            <li> Because I have locs, the drying time is the same (more than 30 minutes to a hour or so): however, I rather sit under this than an overhead dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it mostly for deep conditioning treatments, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li> I just turn it every 5-10 minutes so a different part of my head is getting most of the heat.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cute!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> The first two times I tried to use it</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> I also like that this product can fit a child&#x27;s head or an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I initially brought a gold n hot dryer attachment cap and had issues with the cap fitting rods/rollers as well as staying on and distributing heat</li>
            <li> Complete and even heat coverage with comfortable wear</li>
            <li> I think because the instructions say use on warm and not hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use and extremely durable.</li>
            <li> I saw some people had trouble fitting it on their dryer, but it fit mine no problem.</li>
            <li> I always like to give positive reviews</li>
            <li> It pretty much fits just like pictured -</li>
            <li> It really makes the heating process so much easier!</li>
            <li> I do love this because I can pretty much do anything while letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> but I since most require you to air dry your hair</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t ex[ect that it will dry my hair more than serving as a steaming treatment.</li>
            <li> Quiet, easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Seems like the air does not circulate to the front as well as in the back where hair easily dries.</li>
            <li> I bought this to dry my curly hair without touching it while it was drying.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure that your hair is completely dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durting operation even on high and the hottest setting the hood stays in place with zero interruption of hot air to my head.</li>
            <li> Higher quality items yield high results.vice</li>
            <li> Higher quality items yield high results.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed (I&#x27;m actually using it right now, which reminded me that I needed to write a review!).  </li>
            <li> On just the low setting, I experienced inconsistent heat, overheating and the dryer attachment did not easily fit.</li>
            <li> so too much air does not escape.</li>
            <li> When you put on the hood it is shaped like it was designed for Marge Simpson (hair that sticks straight up from your head).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly</li>
            <li> so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s takes much longer</li>
            <li> Better than expected</li>
            <li> I like it for travel very compact.  </li>
            <li> This was absolutely a disaster.</li>
            <li> Also, the drawing allows to much air to escape.</li>
            <li> Overheated and burned a whole through the material and through the couch.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li> and she was very content with it on her head.</li>
            <li> You simply adjust the fit.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I had to struggle to fit the opening of the Softhood around my dryer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants or needs a dryer.</li>
            <li> Since it was such a cheap dryer, I decided to upgrade and bought a Babyliss Pro Titanium blow dryer (2000 watt).</li>
            <li> I used this dryer 4 times so far, 3 times while traveling abroad and once at home before I left (to make sure it worked).  </li>
            <li> I used my old dryer,set it on low setting and it was more thanenough heat.</li>
            <li> Was excited to use because of the good reviews but did not work with my thick ,long hair.</li>
            <li> This attachment is large enough to fit all of the hair appendages I&#x27;ve tried this far.</li>
            <li> --mine is fine and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was interested in trying out some natural hairstyles</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been alternating between low and cool every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> You can rest your blow dryer down and use both your hands to type like what I am doing now :-).</li>
            <li> I am able to watch youtube while deep conditioning and the hot air is not particularly concentrated to one are like my steamer.</li>
            <li> CAN QUICKLY BURN YOUR HEAD, HAVE TO USE IT ON LOW HEAT</li>
            <li> looks decent.</li>
            <li> I suggest you have a hand held dryer with a low heat setting as it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take to high heat at the muzzle of the dryer after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the little case it comes in</li>
            <li> it relieves the scorching heat that comes with using an overhead dryer; however, I only see myself using this to set curls or for hot oil treatments!</li>
            <li> Clean fresh smelling year round fragrance.</li>
            <li> The drawstring and neck security are not very sturdy or comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like the portability of this bonnet hair dryer but even on low heat, my whole head was HOT.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair without me having to blow dry it so that was good.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot in the back, too hot, and not enough air reaches the front.  </li>
            <li> Im actually under it right now</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is nice and compact and it does dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The pink is extra cute.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long, however, and I am pretty sure I can rectify this by putting slightly less hair in each roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not do an adequate job on my loose hair.</li>
            <li> It took so much longer to dry my hair than I was willing to wait.  </li>
            <li> or I have to add pillows (when the chair is too short) or find a higher surface (when the chair is too hair).</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have that actually stays on!</li>
            <li> and it came early!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and fairly easy way to dry hair, especially if coloring it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and it gets frizzy quickly if I use the hand held dryer to dry after shower, but with this it is similar to using a diffuser</li>
            <li> Worth every single coin.</li>
            <li> I also have a very large head (23&amp;#34;) and I was worried that my head would not fit into a hatbox/hard shell type hair dryer with hair rollers in.</li>
            <li> I normally use a soft-hood-dryer contraption that doesn&#x27;t require being hooked up to a blow-dryer -- and it has a better hood shape (its soft hood is ROUND so that it covers the front, sides and back of the head more evenly) than this one, but they both essentially produce the same results -- dry hair in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Because other viewers commented about the hot ears, I simply took my ears out from under the curl former and I was fine.</li>
            <li> It also is very hot, follow the instructions and only use the low setting.</li>
            <li> I was looking into buying a hood dryer for my room, which is expensive and very bulky, and I am so glad I found out about these!</li>
            <li> I needed it for large velcro curlers and there wasn&#x27;t enough room for air circulation.</li>
            <li> I can get up early in the AM and gave my hair styled and ready for the night by the afternoon instead of waiting all night for a next day style.</li>
            <li> It barely fit over my head when I had the curlformers in, and it did not fit over my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I usually start on Hot at Hi and if the air gets too hot, I switch to Hot at Low.</li>
            <li> and I can see why as I think it would probably melt the plastic tube near the hair</li>
            <li> Multiple adjustment sizes for the head and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The pressure of my blow-dryer set on low was way too much for this flimsy cap.</li>
            <li> This product was cheaply made and did not fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Although the description of the hood says It will fit any hair dryer, it did not fit mine.</li>
            <li> I have never used a soft hood attachment before</li>
            <li> but it still has stayed put so far.</li>
            <li> I will take this if I have to travel and need a bonnet since its very small and the accompanying pouch is adorable.</li>
            <li> Good item, a little too small for my head with all the curlers.</li>
            <li> It seems like the heat is highly concentrated at the back of my neck where the tube meets the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for setting curls and not so much for drying long hair as if you were using a hand dryer.</li>
            <li> How long it will take really depends on your hair</li>
            <li> So I would say, when I start, my hair is very damp to damp, but usually not soaking wet when I put the rollers in.</li>
            <li> Wake up in morning, take shower letting steam absorb in hair, twist with a little product and flax gel and put this on while you are doing your make up etc... for 30 minutes and your twists will be dry and fresh  pretty twist or braid out.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> This dryer definitely gets the job done and it&#x27;s much more convenient than my hard bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I then flipped my hair right side up and the cap kept sliding down my face.  </li>
            <li> I like morei can sit on the couch and dry my hair, I also enjoy the fact that it takes only 20-30 minutes to dry my hair than with a hooded dryer, it took a hour!</li>
            <li> No regrets on this one!</li>
            <li> I have a standard sized blow drier, but the hose on this is way too small to get it to fit around the nozzle of the blow drier.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the hose that needs to connect to the hairdryer is so small, that it won&#x27;t fit over my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The usual problems of tearing because its vinyl, adjusting to close (create a snug fit) a problem, or the actual hood blowing off my head because of the force of the dyer always made these gadgets cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fact that the soft hood actually stays on your head while in use.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my old dryer.</li>
            <li> It works well for deep conditioning which is all I have used it for so far, but probably works well for roller setting too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I used it on my 2 1/2 year old on a low setting while she played on my iPad</li>
            <li> Finally a way to straighten my hair without direct heat.  </li>
            <li> It took about an hour to dry my hair with my hair dryer on high heat attached to this.</li>
            <li> Very Useful for college girl with small space and smaller budget!</li>
            <li> so I would suggest making sure you get the drawstring tight and then using the lower snaps on the strap to give yourself a little room to move around.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair fast enough though.</li>
            <li> Grab one of these at this very affordable price and wet, set, knot and curl to your hearts desire!</li>
            <li> I tried to use these on my locs and they would NOT dry.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot which makes the time spent shorter to get the hair dry.  </li>
            <li> every for those with full thick hair</li>
            <li> It comes with a great little zippered pouch for traveling/storing the device, which was small enough to take up very little room in my carry-on bag, and it was squishy</li>
            <li> It looks ridiculous, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> but when it provides nuch nicer curls than I was getting just letting my natural curls air dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extra step, not sure it&#x27;s worth it just yet.</li>
            <li> while under what I have come to jokingly call my &amp;#34;Bonnet of Beauty&amp;#34;)  My hair is tame and curled and the curls stay in.  </li>
            <li> First I tried upside down and my hair just pooled at the bottom and was sopping wet.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and found that my ends did not dry when I bunched it up under the curl former; however, my roots were dry.</li>
            <li> Due to this it sometimes gets a little too hot for me and I have to take a break and adjust.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry because you can only keep the dryer on low setting.</li>
            <li> so I can use it and talk on the phone on an earpiece without major irritation to the other party.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that after 40 min, my hair still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it it definitely  not meant to be used with loose hair</li>
            <li> I wanted this to dry my dreadlocks, as it takes such a long time with the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I can see myself using it more in cold weather, as it warms you up a lot.</li>
            <li> Its too difficult to secure</li>
            <li> Had to cut to fit my weird hairdryer</li>
            <li> I use this bonnet to dry my hair after a shower before I straighten with flat iron, I get smoother results than if I brush it and dry with hand dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair took a really long time to dry</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this, I ended up returning it due to the fact that it did not help me in drying my hair, it just seemed to get in the way.</li>
            <li> air drying takes forever with my very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Ive also found that putting my dryer on high heat for a few minutes and them taking my hair down immediately helps me get looser curls.</li>
            <li> it works, just don&#x27;t saturate your hair or it will take longer to dry.</li>
            <li> Well made with a roomy pouch that I also store my hand creme in while waiting for my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> no problem getting it over a headful of Curlformers - but the dry time makes this method unacceptable for us.</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair and put up my makeup hands-free with this.</li>
            <li> On non-hair washing days, I just put my hair up in the rollers, spritz and dry with the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> I did try to keep it on for 30 minutes and still my hair was barely dry.</li>
            <li> I can wrap my hair in curlers, but this on and dry my hair while I put make-up on.</li>
            <li> I can sit and watch TV while I dry my hair, work on the laptop, etc.</li>
            <li> I tried using it to dry my curly hair by just sticking the hair in there, but that didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> (since I have thicker hair, it took longer to dry).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with completely ruining wet sets, twist out styles, etc because after one full night of uncomfortable sleep my hair still doesn&#x27;t fully DRY.</li>
            <li> You have to play around with it in order to dry hair completely well at least in my case because I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of these in pink color but was only shipped 1 in black color.</li>
            <li> But my only problem is that I ordered pink and received black.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to get the bonnet attached however my 13 year old</li>
            <li> Also...since this mostly blows air at your nape/neck, it is impossible to use this with any heat setting other than cold/cool air.</li>
            <li> This does what a sit under salon dryer does but without having to actually sit under the big hard dryer.</li>
            <li> but it did not work the way I had expected.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to walk around with wet hair, until I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> and my hair was still wet in places.  </li>
            <li> the way my hair dried within 45-50 mins same time under a hairdresser&#x27;s dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely portable, it rolls up small and came with a bag to put it in and barely takes up any space in my suitcase when I travel.</li>
            <li> but this was a complete failure.</li>
            <li> I could actually dry it upside down for oomph.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with it having to dry on low heat, it simply takes way too long to dry.</li>
            <li> It typically feels dry after an hour</li>
            <li> We did notice that the sleeve that attaches to the hairdryer has vent holes cut out of the plastic material it&#x27;s made of that will start to melt a little if you use it too long.</li>
            <li> All previous fails with air drying have become success with this bonnet.</li>
            <li> I have struggled to fit all 40 XL and Wide curl formers in here, Ive tried it once, and its extremely uncomfortable/almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Very possible that I am not doing it correctly, but it feels to me that its a bit small.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with it being hot or uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tyed of &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I found that they were either too bulky, got too hot, or too uncomfortable to sit under.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
            <li> is that it is easier than trying to sit under the hair dryer due to space and other setup issues.</li>
            <li> This dryer recommends that you use a low setting,there was hardly any heat all over.</li>
            <li> The heat did not distribute well enough to all parts of my hair, and I could hardly feel the heat at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this really works.</li>
            <li> It cuts my styling time down to a fraction of what it used to be.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day--fabulous!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help speed up my hair drying process since I usually let me hair air dry.</li>
            <li> If I hold it in place and dry it for about 15 minutes longer than it usually takes me, it does what I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> With my hard bonnet hair dryer it has to be sitting on a flat surface at the prefect height</li>
            <li> Then it takes less time with the cap/dryer.</li>
            <li> I am black and my hair was rolled in two inch rollers, where my hair was wrapped around nine times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry often and when I do, I need to use high heat so that was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> No more leaving with a wet head.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and</li>
            <li> Not for people with thick long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a big convenience not having to be contained to some weird location in my apartment that has a flat surface to sit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The elastic around the end of the hose is REALLY tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube fits on my hairdryer with just a little fussing but it holds tight.  </li>
            <li> The Bonnet comes with a little bag to store it in when your not using it as well.</li>
            <li> It is compact and folds into a little travel pouch which comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I mean, uncomfortable, almost sweltering hot.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and it delivers.</li>
            <li> cause there have been a few times</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how noisy it is.</li>
            <li> Looks odd, but works!</li>
            <li> The end was a little too small to go over the end of my dryer</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with this, it was clumsy to use and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but I imagine that is that seals it so tight!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and past my shoulder blades so is quite long.</li>
            <li> This has cut my deep conditioning time down to just 15 mins but results of overnight conditioning!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to get the end over the blow dryer</li>
            <li> The attachment is too small and I had to make some alterations to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> and I usually lay my dryer on the desk and work on my computer for 20-25 minutes while it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to being dried with a blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> Yes, you feel like a bit of a doofus while wearing it, but give it 10 minutes, and you&#x27;re out the door with perfectly dried hair!</li>
            <li> There is a small escape of air where the pull string tightens</li>
            <li> so usually I&#x27;m looking at 45min to an hour.  </li>
            <li> I was not able too use this product.</li>
            <li> Prior to getting this, I would either have to sleep in the rollers, which is incredibly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The fabric (not sure what it is) does not melt or tear.</li>
            <li> I also was bummed when I found that the hose was just a bit too small for my dryer, but I just made a couple of slits with scissors and pulled it over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the past three weeks I have pulled off curlformers, Bantu knots and a rod set.</li>
            <li> I have a hard bonnet hair dryer that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> Hard to put over dryer nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I style my hair and sit under this for at least 1.5 hrs.</li>
            <li> but I also have thick hair so it could have just been me.</li>
            <li> I used it once and tossed it under my vanity with all the other useless junk.  </li>
            <li> The drawstring is rather awkward to use; I flip upside down and tuck my hair in the pull the drawstring and end up adjusting a few times before I can relax.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a blow dryer with a nozzle that this fits properly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as annoying as sitting under a normal dryer.</li>
            <li> Yes, you look absolutely ridiculous and you pray that the doorbell doesn&#x27;t ring while you&#x27;re doing it</li>
            <li> You look absolutely ridiculous and feel ridiculous too, it does leak air by where the drawstring is.</li>
            <li> Even with the weird hood shape, it dried my hair well.</li>
            <li> I works well as a conditioning cap I also have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I think the string to mine is broken.  </li>
            <li> It would make sleeping in rollers unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Plus, she looked and felt absolutely ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a very unpleasant experience using this hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s just in the wrong spot</li>
            <li> was really difficult to keep placed on head</li>
            <li> Attaching the bonnet to the hair dryer can be quite difficult</li>
            <li> Chin strap is also really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was EXTREMELY difficult to get it on to my Conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Each time I tried using it, I cooked the crap out of the hair at the base of my neck where the air comes in and the rest of my head stayed damp even running it for an entire hour.</li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable and awkward.  </li>
            <li> and I was unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I thought that it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist who uses hood dryers for roller sets all the time and was very skeptical about how well this would work....</li>
            <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTACH TO THE DRYER AND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that  it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> the string has annoyingly fallen into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a lot of annoying experiences with cheapies that gets blown away once I use my hair blower with it.</li>
            <li> I found the chin strap to be annoying, so I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> todayand was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all.  Waste of money.  The drawstrings didn&#x27;t fasten the hood securely and it kept blowing off my head.  I found it uncomfortable and awkward.  I always like to give positive reviews but this was a complete failure. If I could give it zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer but even on warm setting it gets really hot. I need to keep switching from cool and warm.</li>
            <li> Well, is not the Best, it gets reallt hot and it moves on my head while am drying my hair, dont really like it.</li>
            <li> This is so convenient! Perfect for the mornings when I&#x27;m trying to put on my make-up.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of these in pink color but was only shipped 1 in black color. I emailed the seller and it was immediately resolved. So glad I found this. This does what a sit under salon dryer does but without having to actually sit under the big hard dryer. Great for travel too!!</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job fairly well. The drawstring and neck security are not very sturdy or comfortable. However, for the price, I would say this item is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what a hair dryer should do.</li>
            <li> I would like this a lot more if it fit my blow dryer. The attachment is too small and I had to make some alterations to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> It barely fit over my head when I had the curlformers in, and it did not fit over my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it, I am a college student and don&#x27;t  have enough space or money to get a bulky hair dryer. This is perfect and very well made</li>
            <li> It works. For me it takes a lot longer than in the instructions. But it&#x27;s so much better than having to sleep in curl formers!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer attachment you can get so much done while using it. It takes some getting use to, if you don&#x27;t pull the drawstrings correctly you&#x27;ll have a huge hole where they meet and all your air will escape.</li>
            <li> This works great for me.  There is plenty of room for rollers under the cap - I use 2&amp;#34; diameter rollers for the top, back and sides. The hose stays on the dryer whether I have it on Hi or Low. The chin strap keeps the cap on my head whether I have the dryer on Hi or Low. The pull cord keeps the cap snug to head so too much air does not escape. I usually start on Hot at Hi and if the air gets too hot, I switch to Hot at Low. My hair is usually wrapped in a towel a bit first as I pull out the cap &amp; dryer, rollers and pins. So I would say, when I start, my hair is very damp to damp, but usually not soaking wet when I put the rollers in. Then it takes less time with the cap/dryer. I even like the travel bag. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked great, even though the shape of the &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34; is a bit strange.  When you put on the hood it is shaped like it was designed for Marge Simpson (hair that sticks straight up from your head).  I used this dryer 4 times so far, 3 times while traveling abroad and once at home before I left (to make sure it worked).  I normally use a soft-hood-dryer contraption that doesn&#x27;t require being hooked up to a blow-dryer -- and it has a better hood shape (its soft hood is ROUND so that it covers the front, sides and back of the head more evenly) than this one, but they both essentially produce the same results -- dry hair in about 30 minutes.  My hair is very curly so I like these hood devices to keep the curls intact and reduce any frizzing so I was happy to find one that I could travel with easily.  Even with the weird hood shape, it dried my hair well. (I was tempted to hold my head upside-down so that it would drop into the TALL shape of the hood.)  It comes with a great little zippered pouch for traveling/storing the device, which was small enough to take up very little room in my carry-on bag, and it was squishy so it was easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the hood design needs to be improved, it does work well so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.  (If they were to improve the hood shape, I would give it 5-stars.) And I had no problem connecting the end of the tube (which has an elasticized opening) over the end of the blow-dryer at home or at the hotel.</li>
            <li> I do love this because I can pretty much do anything while letting my hair air dry. However I&#x27;m not a huge fan of how noisy it is. Probably the blow dryer&#x27;s fault. If you&#x27;re considering it, it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need. Does the job.</li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t fit over my conair blow dryer (measures 8 inches around the nozzle) but I found a way to make it work. I tie an elastic headband over the nozzle to keep the the dryer from flying off. It&#x27;s an extra step, not sure it&#x27;s worth it just yet. I will do an update after I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh smelling year round fragrance.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have used it a few times and it delivers. I&#x27;m impress with the airflow n the fact that the soft hood actually stays on your head while in use. 👍🏾</li>
            <li> This hooded dryer is a great investment. It help speeds up drying my hair. It&#x27;s easy to pack away. I am a satisfied customer. I like it so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Best of the best for hair treatment</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was happy to see that her gift was delivered on time as promised</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this, I ended up returning it due to the fact that it did not help me in drying my hair, it just seemed to get in the way. I purchased it so that I could save some time with curlers in my hair but it did not work the way I had expected.</li>
            <li> Love this portable hair dryer.  So Naptural85 on YouTube use this on her &amp;#34;morning multi-tasking&amp;#34; video. Wake up in morning, take shower letting steam absorb in hair, twist with a little product and flax gel and put this on while you are doing your make up etc... for 30 minutes and your twists will be dry and fresh  pretty twist or braid out.  it works, just don&#x27;t saturate your hair or it will take longer to dry.</li>
            <li> This hooded dryer is just ok because It didn&#x27;t stay on my head even though I had adjusted the straps under my chin, it just didn&#x27;t stay put on my head. Therefore, I had to hold the top of the hooded dryer to my head so it want blow off my head. I thought that it was very uncomfortable. I couldn&#x27;t stand the heat from the blow dryer because it was too hot. I manage to stay under the hooded dryer for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes. Overall, it was a very unpleasant experience using this hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Great for Oil or Deep Conditioners!</li>
            <li> I have struggled to fit all 40 XL and Wide curl formers in here, Ive tried it once, and its extremely uncomfortable/almost impossible. Very possible that I am not doing it correctly, but it feels to me that its a bit small. I love the concept and it doesnt get too hot. I will keep it and try more often and update if it gets better</li>
            <li> Great product and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was interested in trying out some natural hairstyles but I since most require you to air dry your hair and I knew my hair would take hours to dry on its own I decided to invest in this. I love it! It fit well over my hairdryer and is extremely easy to understand. The Bonnet comes with a little bag to store it in when your not using it as well. it fit very comfortable over my head and had a strap that fit under your chin to keep the bonnet attached while it was drying your hair. It took about an hour to dry my hair with my hair dryer on high heat attached to this. I was concerned about it fitting over all of my hair wrapped in Curlformers however it fit comfortably and was able to do its job giving my soft bouncy curls in a reasonable amount of drying time.</li>
            <li> Works well. Inexpensive and fairly easy way to dry hair, especially if coloring it. Looks odd, but works!</li>
            <li> I feel like a total weirdo when using this thing but when it provides nuch nicer curls than I was getting just letting my natural curls air dry.  I have type 3A curls (mildly thick, Caucasian hair, no color treatment and mostly using Deva Curl products) and this provides me with a great shape that I can&#x27;t get with my diffuser or with air drying.  I wish I could use a warmer setting but the instructions say not to and I can see why as I think it would probably melt the plastic tube near the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube fits on my hairdryer with just a little fussing but it holds tight.  The tube is a great length and I usually lay my dryer on the desk and work on my computer for 20-25 minutes while it&#x27;s on.  The drawstring is rather awkward to use; I flip upside down and tuck my hair in the pull the drawstring and end up adjusting a few times before I can relax.  I feel like it&#x27;s just in the wrong spot cause there have been a few times the string has annoyingly fallen into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this to any of my curly hair friends and I will continue to use it every day as I have been since I got it.</li>
            <li> This is actually a fantastic piece of equipment! I have thick, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to being dried with a blow-dryer. I thought I was doomed to walk around with wet hair, until I discovered this product. Yes, you feel like a bit of a doofus while wearing it, but give it 10 minutes, and you&#x27;re out the door with perfectly dried hair! Use your own hair dryer and avoid frizzy flyaways! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I used the hair dryer for the first time  todayand was very disappointed.I am so glad that I did not throw out my old bonnet dryer.I had to go back to my old dryer.This dryer recommends that you use a low setting,there was hardly any heat all over.I used my old dryer,set it on low setting and it was more thanenough heat.I have shoulder length hair and it did not work for me.I am sending back this dryer</li>
            <li> Affordable, compact &amp; functional!  Worth every single coin.</li>
            <li> I like morei can sit on the couch and dry my hair, I also enjoy the fact that it takes only 20-30 minutes to dry my hair than with a hooded dryer, it took a hour!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to dry my dreadlocks, as it takes such a long time with the hairdryer. It works fine, it&#x27;s easy to put on, but it doesn&#x27;t save time. You can only use it on low setting. I can see myself using it more in cold weather, as it warms you up a lot. As an added bonus it&#x27;s hilarious looking, you will laugh when you put this on.</li>
            <li> Perfect for your needs.</li>
            <li> amazing very innovative and easy to use. every for those with full thick hair</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have used to dry my hair. It cuts my styling time down to a fraction of what it used to be. I love it. i use it to do twist outs and braid outs. I also like using it for deep conditioners. The draw string assures that it won&#x27;t fly off my head which is great and it fits perfectly over all 5 of my blow dryers which are all different sizes. Once again I love it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It soft, fairly comfortable, and efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist who uses hood dryers for roller sets all the time and was very skeptical about how well this would work....I do my hair every 4 days in headband curls and this works great for making sure they get dried all the way through if I decide to do them last minute instead of over night. Ive also found that putting my dryer on high heat for a few minutes and them taking my hair down immediately helps me get looser curls. I have a second bonnet to use for heating my hair while doing a treatment. So far I really love this product!</li>
            <li> The best! And because of the material great for traveling. Multiple adjustment sizes for the head and is very convenient. No problems with drying hair using hair dryer. I do use medium heat and its worked fine. I would recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair fast enough though. You&#x27;ll have to sit for at;east 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this.  I love using Curlformers to curl my hair but air drying takes forever with my very long hair.  This thing shortens the time by a great deal and it is very easy to use!  I did not have any problems with it being hot or uncomfortable at all.  I love the little case it comes in it makes it super easy to take with you when traveling!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have a standard sized blow drier, but the hose on this is way too small to get it to fit around the nozzle of the blow drier. If you hold it or tape it on, the rest of it works great.</li>
            <li> I needed it for large velcro curlers and there wasn&#x27;t enough room for air circulation. Each time I tried using it, I cooked the crap out of the hair at the base of my neck where the air comes in and the rest of my head stayed damp even running it for an entire hour. Unless your head is the size of a cantaloupe or smaller, you may run into the same problem.</li>
            <li> I like the idea  of this product.  It is compact and folds into a little travel pouch which comes with it.  The only problem is that the hose that needs to connect to the hairdryer is so small, that it won&#x27;t fit over my hair dryer.  For this product to work for me, I have to now go out and purchase another hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the company should make the connection part adjustable, perhaps using Velcro or another method to tighten, instead of the elastic that it currently uses.  This would prevent frustration on their customers part.</li>
            <li> It works fine, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do the best job, not like a traditional hooded dryer. I think because the instructions say use on warm and not hot so it&#x27;s takes much longer and I don&#x27;t have the time. It&#x27;s good for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> This thing is brilliant. First off, it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Next, it takes up no room whatsoever in the bathroom.  And most importantly, it works perfectly! I&#x27;ve used it over Velcro rollers, over pin curls, and for deep conditioning treatments. I&#x27;ve used it on the low heat setting and I&#x27;ve used it on the cool setting to set in curls.  Yes, you look absolutely ridiculous and you pray that the doorbell doesn&#x27;t ring while you&#x27;re doing it but it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is a great softhood bonnet dryer attachment.  I have long thick hair and the curls stay in.  Dries hair quickly evenly.  Well made with a roomy pouch that I also store my hand creme in while waiting for my hair to dry.  Good quality.  Fits on the nozzle of my hair dryer.  Is sturdy and storable.  I would definitely recommend this and would re-order it!  5 stars and thank you!</li>
            <li> Stays attached to dryer and drawstring and chin strap keeps hood on.</li>
            <li> Works great. It was easy to attach to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Luv this thing. Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient hair dryer ever. I&#x27;m actually aitting n bed watching a movie, doing a deep conditioning treatment as I write this. I&#x27;ve tried other tyed of &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34; dryers but I found that they were either too bulky, got too hot, or too uncomfortable to sit under. But this one is easy to travel with and store and from what i can tell I&#x27;m getting great heat distribution all over my head too. I wish I had bought 2 instead instead of just one. But my only problem is that I ordered pink and received black.  So I had to deduct a star for that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love it !</li>
            <li> Not for people with thick long hair. Drying takes all day</li>
            <li> As described , very nice</li>
            <li> I have a hard bonnet hair dryer that I&#x27;ve had for years. I purchased this hair dryer because I wanted something that allowed for more flexibility in moving around while my hair is drying. With my hard bonnet hair dryer it has to be sitting on a flat surface at the prefect height or I have to add pillows (when the chair is too short) or find a higher surface (when the chair is too hair). I also have to sit in that one spot. This dryer is much better because I&#x27;m able to sit on my couch and comfortably watch TV while my hair is drying. It&#x27;s definitely a big convenience not having to be contained to some weird location in my apartment that has a flat surface to sit my hair dryer. I&#x27;m going to give it four stars because it does have some hot spots. It seems like the heat is highly concentrated at the back of my neck where the tube meets the bonnet. Due to this it sometimes gets a little too hot for me and I have to take a break and adjust. Other than that I&#x27;ve had no issues. This dryer definitely gets the job done and it&#x27;s much more convenient than my hard bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer. was really difficult to keep placed on head</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Its a little hard to get the end over the blow dryer but I imagine that is that seals it so tight!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with Curlformers, but I haven&#x27;t bought them yet. I still use this to deep condition my hair and it does an okay job. The setting on the dryer is relatively low but it is enough to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap. I am able to watch youtube while deep conditioning and the hot air is not particularly concentrated to one are like my steamer. I will take this if I have to travel and need a bonnet since its very small and the accompanying pouch is adorable.</li>
            <li> I works well as a conditioning cap I also have very thick hair so I don&#x27;t ex[ect that it will dry my hair more than serving as a steaming treatment.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, convenient.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely fashion! I was super excited to try this product because I am NOT a fan of overhead dryers. This product does take the heat out of being tortured under those dryers. Because I have locs, the drying time is the same (more than 30 minutes to a hour or so): however, I rather sit under this than an overhead dryer. Because other viewers commented about the hot ears, I simply took my ears out from under the curl former and I was fine. I do not use the chin strap often because the pull string keeps it in place. There is a small escape of air where the pull string tightens but I do not mind that; I just tighten it tighter. I would recommend this for setting curls and not so much for drying long hair as if you were using a hand dryer. My hair is medium length and found that my ends did not dry when I bunched it up under the curl former; however, my roots were dry. I will use this product again as I like that it relieves the scorching heat that comes with using an overhead dryer; however, I only see myself using this to set curls or for hot oil treatments!</li>
            <li> This product was a great buy.  Easy to use and easy storage.</li>
            <li> Good for drying and conditioning.  This is the first one I have that actually stays on!</li>
            <li> No regrets on this one!</li>
            <li> This is a prefect alternative to having those big hooded dryers. It fit perfectly with my dryer, and although I feel my dryer is much weaker than other brands, it does an excellent job in low setting in combination with this bonnet. My hair is very curly and it gets frizzy quickly if I use the hand held dryer to dry after shower, but with this it is similar to using a diffuser but  it does your entire head at once. I use this bonnet to dry my hair after a shower before I straighten with flat iron, I get smoother results than if I brush it and dry with hand dryer. I would recommend this item, it is nicely made, good material and handy pouch for storage included.</li>
            <li> I love this! It makes styling my hair a snap after washing. Mine came with no issues. It fits my Conair nozzle perfectly and also I have no issues with non-heating. My hair was dry in no time and the curls were beautiful. If it fits my head with space I&#x27;m sure it will fit anyone else&#x27;s head even with rollers, curlformers or whatever else. This saved me a ton of money and works great! I highly recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Fit over 2 inch Velcro rollers with no problem and freed my hands up so I could multi task. Fits nicely on my conair infinity pro dryer.</li>
            <li> For the price this a great soft bonnet. It will attach to .ost hair dryers. I&#x27;ve used it mostly for deep conditioning treatments, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Great even with recommended use of low heat. Quiet, easy to pack for travel. Better than expected and it came early!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Had no problems fitting over the nozzle of the blow dryer. Does not get too hot.  Great addition to my portable kit!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed (I&#x27;m actually using it right now, which reminded me that I needed to write a review!).  It is true that the heat distribution isn&#x27;t great, so I just turn it every 5-10 minutes so a different part of my head is getting most of the heat.  How long it will take really depends on your hair--mine is fine and takes forever to dry so usually I&#x27;m looking at 45min to an hour.  But that&#x27;s way better than 6-8 hours!  Really good value.</li>
            <li> Pretty cute!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what works best for me in terms of the heat. It gets very hot even on the lower setting. So I&#x27;ve been alternating between low and cool every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use and a space saver not like my hooded dryer</li>
            <li> Love this I had purchased two and they arrived right on time. It dries your hair pretty good. Plus I didn&#x27;t want to spend like eighty dollars on a hooded dryer. When this one was cheaper and easy to use. All you do is attach the end to the hair dryer. Attaching the bonnet to the hair dryer can be quite difficult but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> I was not able too use this product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! It comes with its own little pouch - good for traveling! There was minimum&lt;br /&gt;heat loss at the junction with the toggle. The bonnet fit perfectly over my 3&amp;#34; jumbo curlers&lt;br /&gt;(those purple ones). The elastic band fit on my blow dryer without falling off! I, have no&lt;br /&gt;complaints</li>
            <li> I used this saturday and LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! It was hard to get the bonnet attached however my 13 year old made it happen</li>
            <li> Easily used and portable it is an amazing product and gets the job done. It is definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it for travel very compact.  I suggest you have a hand held dryer with a low heat setting as it can get very hot.  I have been very pleased with the dryer and the price.</li>
            <li> I think the string to mine is broken.  Its too difficult to secure so i spend most of the drying time trying to keep the hot air off of my skin.  It also is very hot, follow the instructions and only use the low setting.</li>
            <li> This thing DID NOT want to stay on my head. The pressure of my blow-dryer set on low was way too much for this flimsy cap. I had to return it. Im still awaiting on a refund from amazon! This was absolutely a disaster.</li>
            <li> Im actually under it right now it&#x27;s pretty cool does the job in the convenience of ur home.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to. LOL. The first two times I tried to use it this thing kept blowing off my head. It kind of freaked me out, but with a little help and a lot of pulling it tighter I was able to use it without it successfully flying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this bonnet is that it is easier than trying to sit under the hair dryer due to space and other setup issues. It works well for deep conditioning which is all I have used it for so far, but probably works well for roller setting too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun trying to keep it on your head ;).</li>
            <li> I tried to use these on my locs and they would NOT dry. I had to end up drying them my hand. I will probably never use it again. I don&#x27;t recommend for think hair.</li>
            <li> This product was cheaply made and did not fit my hair dryer. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a blow dryer with a nozzle that this fits properly. I have to rig a rubber band to get it to stay attached. Also, the drawing allows to much air to escape. Good idea but needs improvement!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this really works. It fits perfectly over my blow dryer and I use for deep conditioning. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a genius way to get my daughter&#x27;s hair curly before school each morning. It would make sleeping in rollers unnecessary. Woo hoo! Unfortunately, with it having to dry on low heat, it simply takes way too long to dry. Plus, she looked and felt absolutely ridiculous! It pretty much fits just like pictured - no problem getting it over a headful of Curlformers - but the dry time makes this method unacceptable for us.</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp; Convenient...</li>
            <li> Even if I put it on the lowest heat setting. Still burns my ears. Chin strap is also really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My wife is Domincan and the hair setting is quite a process.  This did the trick, quick and easy and very affordable.</li>
            <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTACH TO THE DRYER AND CAN QUICKLY BURN YOUR HEAD, HAVE TO USE IT ON LOW HEAT</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly. I no longer have to sit under a hot dryer!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with this, it was clumsy to use and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair. It was a pain having to hold the dryer, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help speed up my hair drying process since I usually let me hair air dry. It has been great! No more leaving with a wet head. I still haven&#x27;t used it with rollers/curl formers but I am sure it would be even better for that purpose. My curls look just as great using this instead of air drying, and I only use it for 15-20 minutes while I put my make up</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry because you can only keep the dryer on low setting.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot in the back, too hot, and not enough air reaches the front.  It took so much longer to dry my hair than I was willing to wait.  An hour and my hair was still wet in places.  I have very fine thin hair so I can&#x27;t imagine it would work all that well with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to put over dryer nozzle.  Seems like the air does not circulate to the front as well as in the back where hair easily dries.</li>
            <li> Overheated and burned a whole through the material and through the couch. Would NOT recommend</li>
            <li> Love it!  Gets really hot which makes the time spent shorter to get the hair dry.  Great bargain for the price</li>
            <li> Although the description of the hood says It will fit any hair dryer, it did not fit mine. I had to buy a new dryer.  Furthermore, it it definitely  not meant to be used with loose hair - ony for  use with curlers.  It does not do an adequate job on my loose hair. I was excited about this urchse thinking it would free my hands  while I put on my makeup. I&#x27;m disappointed that  it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like the portability of this bonnet hair dryer but even on low heat, my whole head was HOT. I mean, uncomfortable, almost sweltering hot. Is it just me?</li>
            <li> The heat did not distribute well enough to all parts of my hair, and I could hardly feel the heat at all</li>
            <li> I finally tried this and I was unhappy with the results. After almost 3hrs of being on this on and off because I didn&#x27;t want my dryer to give out. This did not do any justice to my hair. I was actually better of just blow drying and using my straightner . Was excited to use because of the good reviews but did not work with my thick ,long hair. Will need to buy a regular hair dryer hood.</li>
            <li> Good item, a little too small for my head with all the curlers. But otherwise great!</li>
            <li> Love this! I quit using my curling iron to curl my hair and switched to using spiral foam rollers, which I love. Prior to getting this, I would either have to sleep in the rollers, which is incredibly uncomfortable. Now, I can get out of the shower, walk my dog or do things around the house until my hair is the right about of damp to put the rollers in, and then stick this on my head and I have amazing damage-free curls in around 30 minutes. I also use this after I put conditioning treatment such as cholesterol on my hair. I was looking into buying a hood dryer for my room, which is expensive and very bulky, and I am so glad I found out about these! It works just as well as a hood dryer and it fits most blow dryers. It&#x27;s also extremely portable, it rolls up small and came with a bag to put it in and barely takes up any space in my suitcase when I travel. Plus, this is very cheap! What an awesome hair hack!</li>
            <li> Gf uses it regularly and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Very Useful for college girl with small space and smaller budget!</li>
            <li> I bought this to dry my curly hair without touching it while it was drying.  First I tried upside down and my hair just pooled at the bottom and was sopping wet.  I then flipped my hair right side up and the cap kept sliding down my face.  If I hold it in place and dry it for about 15 minutes longer than it usually takes me, it does what I wanted it to do.  It needs a better staying mechanism though.  And it would be nice if the air came from the top of the cap, too, so I could actually dry it upside down for oomph.</li>
            <li> This definitely gets the job done when you&#x27;re traveling and can&#x27;t carry your hard-hat dryer with you! This attachment fit on my blow dryer and head perfectly with any hiccups.</li>
            <li> Fits great on my hairdryer and I&#x27;m using it with my Curly Girl Book and loving my hair!</li>
            <li> Had to cut to fit my weird hairdryer but it works great!</li>
            <li> Now this is a working improvised steamer. I had a lot of annoying experiences with cheapies that gets blown away once I use my hair blower with it. This is it! SO worth the money! Should&#x27;ve gotten this sooner. No I learned not to buy cheapies anymore.</li>
            <li> I planned to use this product for my deep conditioners and drying my roller sets. I have never used a soft hood attachment before so I was unsure of what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was packaged well and I like that it comes with a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was EXTREMELY difficult to get it on to my Conair hair dryer. After much struggling, I was able to attach it but the pull string didn&#x27;t seem to secure it sufficiently onto my head.. A tiny amount of air escaped through my entire drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I won&#x27;t return it and I will give it another try but I can only give it three stars. Some minor improvements could make this product excellent.</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair and put up my makeup hands-free with this. It&#x27;s great. The pink is extra cute.</li>
            <li> Love this handy dryer cap. Set the blow dryer on low put my make up on. Time saving compact little zipper pouch to store couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a great product.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought several  hood attachments for blow dryers. The usual problems of tearing because its vinyl, adjusting to close (create a snug fit) a problem, or the actual hood blowing off my head because of the force of the dyer always made these gadgets cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is very impressive the extended hose does not crinkle so the warm/hot air is not interrupted. You can rest your blow dryer down and use both your hands to type like what I am doing now :-). The fabric (not sure what it is) does not melt or tear. The elasticized end makes it fit almost any blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durting operation even on high and the hottest setting the hood stays in place with zero interruption of hot air to my head. I bought two of these because I have two homes. I plan to buy two more just in case or if the manufacturer should stop making these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way my hair dried within 45-50 mins same time under a hairdresser&#x27;s dryer. My hair is very thick and past my shoulder blades so is quite long. I am black and my hair was rolled in two inch rollers, where my hair was wrapped around nine times. My hair came out beautiful a mass of controllable curls and was completely dried. A great buy.</li>
            <li> although I have not tried but very good material, solid and seems to resist .</li>
            <li> This looks downright hideous when in use, but it does the job I was hoping for.  I have very fine hair and after much trial and error I&#x27;ve found the best way to style it on hair-washing days is to blow it dry (without this cap), then put it in velcro hair rollers, spritz the rollers lightly with water, then sit under this contraption for about 20 minutes, switching between air and medium heat.  (I read my e-mail or a Kindle book, etc. while under what I have come to jokingly call my &amp;#34;Bonnet of Beauty&amp;#34;)  My hair is tame and curled and the curls stay in.  On non-hair washing days, I just put my hair up in the rollers, spritz and dry with the bonnet.  I also have a very large head (23&amp;#34;) and I was worried that my head would not fit into a hatbox/hard shell type hair dryer with hair rollers in. There&#x27;s plenty of room for my giant head and curlers with this.</li>
            <li> This has cut my deep conditioning time down to just 15 mins but results of overnight conditioning!!!!! love it</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I did try to keep it on for 30 minutes and still my hair was barely dry.</li>
            <li> You have to play around with it in order to dry hair completely well at least in my case because I have a lot of hair. It dose it&#x27;s job so 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> You look absolutely ridiculous and feel ridiculous too, it does leak air by where the drawstring is. I had is on for a while and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, I would probably use this once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li> Love this! Very comfortable and practical, but st of all at good price.</li>
            <li> Suprise me, works great</li>
            <li> Good for hot oil treatments, conditioners and curl formers</li>
            <li> Works great. Faster drying</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to pack.  Most hotels have hair dryers that can be attached to the hood hose.  If I have to move around, the hose easily comes off.</li>
            <li> arrived today...looks decent. i will be using it for my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> This product is great to use on roller sets. I used it on my 2 1/2 year old on a low setting while she played on my iPad and she was very content with it on her head. I also like that this product can fit a child&#x27;s head or an adult&#x27;s. You simply adjust the fit.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that this cap easily fit over large velcro rollers, and it could easily stand higher heat (from my dryer&#x27;s low setting) than I could, so I had to hit the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button on the blow dryer for comfort quite a few times. It seems to be made with care, of quality materials, and the zipper pouch makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day--fabulous! I&#x27;ve recently started playing with rollers to either straighten or volumize my hair so I don&#x27;t have to either have crappy hair every day or damaged hair. The only thing was that after 40 min, my hair still wasn&#x27;t dry. My hair is fairly long, however, and I am pretty sure I can rectify this by putting slightly less hair in each roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the heat tends to work more the bottom-back, since that&#x27;s where the hose feeds into, so I turned it upside-down for 10 min so that the top-front could get more heat. I did NOT think the sound or the heat was unbearable--it was all very comfortable. I also was bummed when I found that the hose was just a bit too small for my dryer, but I just made a couple of slits with scissors and pulled it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this is sure to be a good laugh for any partners/roommates/children/boyfriends/relatives who live with you! It looks ridiculous, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I saw reviews on YouTube of how great this was, so i purchased it on amazon. After spending one hour and 10 minutes drying my hair, it was no dryer than when I started.  Trying to keep the blow dryer attached was challenging. It&#x27;s too awkward to use.  I used it once and tossed it under my vanity with all the other useless junk.  And went back to my hood dryer. 30-40 minutes and im done. I do not recommend this product.  Save your money.  I would rate it zero if I could.</li>
            <li> I bought this in liue of dropping a lot of money on a hood dryer. This is okay for the price. My hair took a really long time to dry but I also have thick hair so it could have just been me. The elastic around the end of the hose is REALLY tight. It actually took me and another person holding the hood while I attached the dryer to it. But once it was on it held nicely. The strap on the hood is a bit cumbersome and itchy so I would suggest making sure you get the drawstring tight and then using the lower snaps on the strap to give yourself a little room to move around.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product sometime ago for my wife and she loved it. She has been using it since then and she hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I can wrap my hair in curlers, but this on and dry my hair while I put make-up on. Sold.&lt;br /&gt;Use on lowest heat or no hear setting.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair without me having to blow dry it so that was good. My only issue is that I had to struggle to fit the opening of the Softhood around my dryer.</li>
            <li> it great as I am writing I&#x27;m in the bed and my hair is drying. The end was a little too small to go over the end of my dryer so I did have to cut that before I could use it but it still has stayed put so far.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that it supposed to be used with low heat only. I don&#x27;t blow dry often and when I do, I need to use high heat so that was a bit disappointing. Other than that, it is nice and compact and it does dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this about once every week and she loves it. It&#x27;s easy to travel with and store and it gets the job done very efficiently.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work what so ever, I spend an hour using it with no luck</li>
            <li> I use this for when I dye my hair with henna, or apply conditioning masks. It really makes the heating process so much easier! I can sit and watch TV while I dry my hair, work on the laptop, etc. I saw some people had trouble fitting it on their dryer, but it fit mine no problem. I found the chin strap to be annoying, so I didn&#x27;t use it. I also had to re-position the hood throughout the process so that heat was evenly distributed to my hair, but that&#x27;s still so much better than holding up a hair dryer. Some commented that it gets hot -- its best to use a hair dryer with a warm setting as well so you can switch between the two if needed. I could also see this being useful when putting your hair in velcro rollers. I tried using it to dry my curly hair by just sticking the hair in there, but that didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this item is very useful.  Fixes perfectly on head due to it&#x27;s adjustable fixtures.  It works effortlessly with almost any kind of hand dryer and doesn&#x27;t take too long to warm up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much. More effective just blasting my hair to set it.</li>
            <li> Works great great price</li>
            <li> All this does is blow air at your nape/neck . The airflow is really strong at the bottom but at the sides and top you can barely feel any air coming out.. I highly doubt this successfully dries hair. Also...since this mostly blows air at your nape/neck, it is impossible to use this with any heat setting other than cold/cool air. Even the &#x27;low&#x27; heat setting felt like it was burning my neck/ears/face</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does! Awesome</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!! It&#x27;s so compact I can take it and use it anywhere and it&#x27;s not as annoying as sitting under a normal dryer. I recommend this to anyone who wants or needs a dryer. It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use and extremely durable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and always wait until the last minute to style your hair this will be your best friend. I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with completely ruining wet sets, twist out styles, etc because after one full night of uncomfortable sleep my hair still doesn&#x27;t fully DRY. I&#x27;m too cheap and don&#x27;t have the space for a pro hooded dryer.  I initially brought a gold n hot dryer attachment cap and had issues with the cap fitting rods/rollers as well as staying on and distributing heat well. I had almost given up on styling my own hair until I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more frustration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past three weeks I have pulled off curlformers, Bantu knots and a rod set. All previous fails with air drying have become success with this bonnet. I style my hair and sit under this for at least 1.5 hrs. It typically feels dry after an hour but I&#x27;m particularly cautious and go for the extra half. My hair has never looked better. I can get up early in the AM and gave my hair styled and ready for the night by the afternoon instead of waiting all night for a next day style. This attachment is large enough to fit all of the hair appendages I&#x27;ve tried this far. It&#x27;s also fairly quiet so I can use it and talk on the phone on an earpiece without major irritation to the other party. The days of of canceling plans because you hair ain&#x27;t done are over! Grab one of these at this very affordable price and wet, set, knot and curl to your hearts desire! Awesome product!! The packaging is nice and convenient as well and allows easy concealed storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I initially had issues with this product using a Conair 1875 dryer. On just the low setting, I experienced inconsistent heat, overheating and the dryer attachment did not easily fit. Since it was such a cheap dryer, I decided to upgrade and bought a Babyliss Pro Titanium blow dryer (2000 watt). Works with this product like a dream. Complete and even heat coverage with comfortable wear (only used on the low setting). My advice is if you initially have issues with this item, consider that your dryer might be the problem. Higher quality items yield high results.vice is if you initially have issues with this item, consider that your dryer might be the problem. Higher quality items yield high results.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly! The chin strap is essential.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. We did notice that the sleeve that attaches to the hairdryer has vent holes cut out of the plastic material it&#x27;s made of that will start to melt a little if you use it too long. It doesn&#x27;t take to high heat at the muzzle of the dryer after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is girlfriend approved!</li>
            <li> So Awesome!  Finally a way to straighten my hair without direct heat.  I wrapped my hair, put on a du rag and sat and relaxed with my kids for about 40 minutes (since I have thicker hair, it took longer to dry).  You have to make sure that your hair is completely dry or else you will end up with damp, frizzy hair.  I wish I had discovered this product earlier in life.  I would have had healthier, longer hair by now.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
