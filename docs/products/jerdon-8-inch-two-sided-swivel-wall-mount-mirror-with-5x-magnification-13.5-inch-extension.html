            <li>overall very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li>Great little handy mounted mirror.  </li>
            <li>I had a similar mirror in Satin Nickel before from LNT-brand (Linen And Things), and the mounting bracket fit this mirror as well, which was great.</li>
            <li>It was secure in its packaging.</li>
            <li>Solid   Well built  functional  attractive    </li>
            <li>This comes in useful so many times.</li>
            <li>After cleaning them out it moves freely.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>have it hung up all ready very easy</li>

            <li>It has been a fantastic purchase and the price was super for the quality.  </li>
            <li>I use the mirror for shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to move it in the right position.  </li>
            <li>every man deserves a shaving mirror right in the shower!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and very good quality.  </li>
            <li>I got them out, purchased heavy duty ones with flanges and was successful - for about a week when the weight and tension of extending it out [to see if any of my wrinkles magically disappeared]</li>
            <li>It is a good size, but I want to use it to cut my hair and I wear glasses, so I would like it to be bigger</li>
            <li>My husband took it apart and found it full of shavings.  </li>
            <li>The mirror itself is very nice, attractive - well made, solid and not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Great color to match the other oil rubbed bronze items in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had 10x magnification, but I knew it was 5x and went with it due to the great price.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a 3X would be better for me, but I just move back to see better.  </li>
            <li>A tremendous value at any price.  </li>
            <li>it looked so well designed, super polished....</li>
            <li>one may not have noticed before are very evident.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it up, sturdy thus far, and works great!</li>
            <li>Easy to mount; large; matches my oil rubbed bronze hardware.  </li>
            <li>super easy to mount and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a fine mirror that doesn&#x27;t swivel very well.</li>
            <li>I love how it was shipped super fast even if I didnt choose fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a great little mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to see my hair from the back and still be able to have both hands free.</li>
            <li>Am pleased with the performance so far</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, the color is exactly what I wanted and It makes putting on makeup sooooo much easier.  </li>
            <li>the right price, and no shipping.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is just right for us.  </li>
            <li>were located right where I didn&#x27;t want the mirror, but again - not the mirror&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li>It has 2 sides and the magnifying side is just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right also,</li>
            <li>Might be worth spending a little more for a better mirror.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price.</li>
            <li>The non-magnified side is great for using with a vanity mirror to check the back of your hair to make sure it&#x27;s not sticking out like alien hands.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Seller had fast shipping and product came exact as described!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The mirror construction is pretty stable and solid, with screws to tighten most joints if they get loosened over time.</li>
            <li>The LNT mirror had several holes for screws, making the mounting more stable.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My wife was against getting this at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and pivots so many different ways.</li>
            <li>Makes applying eye makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
            <li>I use it to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots when buzzing the back of my head.</li>
            <li>And now I have one just like the higher end hotels that we go to regularly  :)</li>
            <li>You can find free standing ones all day, but I wanted my counter clear.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a stud finder especially if the mirror will be moved around ALOT.</li>
            <li>so I could see a little better my finely coiffed hairdo without eyeglasses, but that&#x27;s my problem...</li>
            <li>You have it in other finishes, why not the ever popular Oil Bronze Finish?</li>
            <li>Seems just as good as much more expensive mirrors.  </li>
            <li>This Jerdon is heavy, folds easily and was easy to install.</li>
            <li>Mounted in the wooden side of an adjacent cabinet, it went up easily.  </li>
            <li>I got this mirror for my husband to use in a large shower, and he is please with the quality and appearance.</li>
            <li>The mirror swivels smoothly, hangs straight and has clear viewing on both the normal and magnifying sides.</li>
            <li>I didnt mount yet because I need to find out if my wall is secure enough to hold this mirror.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful when getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I find it so much easier to use putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>so I could see the whole backside of my head...</li>
            <li>but once she got it and used it she said this really helps speed up the application of her war paint (make-up).</li>
            <li>Very please.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>MAtches our bronze fixtures very well.</li>
            <li>VERY adjustable.</li>
            <li>When using the 5x side, there is way too much distortion in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Solid, secure.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, a must trying to do makeup with bifocals.</li>
            <li>it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>I love the finish, as it matches my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li>I considered other mirrors, including lighted ones, but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>Much more than any other mirror I have owned.  </li>
            <li>The extending arm mechanism on this mirror was crooked, so it did not extend smoothly, and screeched loudly.</li>
            <li>The main mirror attaches in seconds.</li>
            <li>Or too zoom in on my face with 5x magnification and look at all my facial features really closely, which is actually really useful when trying to shave blurry-eyed in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, it blends right in with our other bronze fixtures, magnifies really really big.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Came missing a screw, but I was able to replace it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most heavy duty</li>
            <li>Bought better wall plugs to hang it with the ones that come with the mirror where a little small and didn&#x27;t seem like they would hold it very securely.</li>
            <li>One advantage of getting a little &#x27;older&#x27; is your eyesight is affected which has an nice automatic &#x27;airbrush&#x27; effect on your face when you look in a regular mirror.  </li>
            <li>I needed one for the newly remodeled master suite.  </li>
            <li>and it is still in like new condition.  </li>
            <li>Just put up my new mirror.  </li>
            <li>2 years now and still functions and  looks like new.</li>
            <li>it matches all the finishes in my new bathroom and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install, wish arms were a little longer, I wanted to mount to the studs in the wall for the most security, but if the studs are 6\\&quot; too far away, you will still have to lean over your counter a little.</li>
            <li>very clear mirror.....</li>
            <li>Have had the first mirror for several years, and have noticed no rusting as yet.</li>
            <li>I put up my original LNT mirror with 3 screws and anchors in the bracket, and over 6 years of daily use it never moved or wobbled, not even a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Please so far!</li>
            <li>After years and years of using the magnified make-up mirrors in the higher end hotels, I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy one for our master bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Our light fixtures are centered between our double sinks which means one side of my face is always in shadow.  </li>
            <li>Clear.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought a couple of these so far.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend buying this product over the $150 versions in the same color.</li>
            <li>My husband had no trouble putting it up.</li>
            <li>to another home and getting a second one since I miss it so much.</li>
            <li>this will be MUCH easier on my back!</li>
            <li>The swing arm works perfectly, although the sturdyness of it is a little weak, but it&#x27;s just me using it, so I am careful with it.  </li>
            <li>Not an exact match to my bathroom fixtures that are oil brushed bronze, but it is only noticable on cloe inspection.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I have one of these in the main floor bath, in brushed nickel.  </li>
            <li>Had one exactly the same in my last house but had to leave it there.  </li>
            <li>We had to have a way to get close enough to the mirror to insert contact lenses in our new home that was built for people a foot taller than we are.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it may be the regular bronze color; however, this is the Dark Bronze and extends just as far as most other mirrors.</li>
            <li>Coloring was a major concern for me, as everything in our bathroom is bronze</li>
            <li>Right now, the swivel is really tight both on the mirror and arms.  </li>
            <li>After looking high and low decided to get the same one in an oil rubbed bronze finish.  </li>
            <li>It is not a smooth gliding system, and it comes loose from the wall easily.  </li>
            <li>Specifically, the ability to apply makeup without climbing on the counter, as the wall mirror is simply too far away.  </li>
            <li>The magnified side is barely magnified at all.</li>
            <li>A little stiff at the joints, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up over time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It looks great in my bathroom and as I am getting older</li>
            <li> The quality is great and fits in with my high end rubbed bronze fixtures.</li>
            <li> The oil rubbed bronze finish on this matched our other bathroom accessories perfectly and the price was much better than some others we looked at.</li>
            <li> This makes shaving incredibly more precise.</li>
            <li> Clear mirror, swivels easy, great bargain.</li>
            <li> The finish blends right in with my oil rubbed bronze faucet, and looks really nice.  </li>
            <li> The finish matches perfectly with the rest of the bathroom accessories which was the other reason I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> Installed easily.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to find oil rubbed bronze as you would think.</li>
            <li> Looks just as pictured, and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> My husband easily installed the mirror in my dressing room.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> I wish it extended out just a few more inches, but otherwise it&#x27;s great and looks like it was made to be in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> Easy to install and</li>
            <li> Mounted easily.</li>

            <li> EASY TO INSTALL.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount.</li>
            <li> bought the bronze color and is really nice as is opaque and kind of dark (looks very elegant)</li>
            <li> in all, this is a really nice mirror and anyone with more handy-woman saavy than I would have no problem hanging it right the first time!</li>
            <li> Well made, good grade of mirror, not hard to mount.  </li>
            <li> and this one works fine.</li>
            <li> This mirror works fine.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Mirror and magnification fine.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this tremendously.  </li>
            <li> overall very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li> Great little handy mounted mirror.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar mirror in Satin Nickel before from LNT-brand (Linen And Things), and the mounting bracket fit this mirror as well, which was great.</li>
            <li> It was secure in its packaging.</li>
            <li> Solid   Well built  functional  attractive    </li>
            <li> This comes in useful so many times.</li>
            <li> After cleaning them out it moves freely.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> have it hung up all ready very easy</li>
            <li> Very easy install-will not fog up and can see clearly!!!</li>
            <li> looks rich.</li>
            <li> It has been a fantastic purchase and the price was super for the quality.  </li>
            <li> I use the mirror for shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to move it in the right position.  </li>
            <li> every man deserves a shaving mirror right in the shower!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and very good quality.  </li>
            <li> I got them out, purchased heavy duty ones with flanges and was successful - for about a week when the weight and tension of extending it out [to see if any of my wrinkles magically disappeared]</li>
            <li> It is a good size, but I want to use it to cut my hair and I wear glasses, so I would like it to be bigger</li>
            <li> My husband took it apart and found it full of shavings.  </li>
            <li> The mirror itself is very nice, attractive - well made, solid and not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Great color to match the other oil rubbed bronze items in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had 10x magnification, but I knew it was 5x and went with it due to the great price.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a 3X would be better for me, but I just move back to see better.  </li>
            <li> A tremendous value at any price.  </li>
            <li> it looked so well designed, super polished....</li>
            <li> one may not have noticed before are very evident.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it up, sturdy thus far, and works great!</li>
            <li> Easy to mount; large; matches my oil rubbed bronze hardware.  </li>
            <li> super easy to mount and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a fine mirror that doesn&#x27;t swivel very well.</li>
            <li> I love how it was shipped super fast even if I didnt choose fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to see my hair from the back and still be able to have both hands free.</li>
            <li> Am pleased with the performance so far</li>
            <li> It was easy to install, the color is exactly what I wanted and It makes putting on makeup sooooo much easier.  </li>
            <li> the right price, and no shipping.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is just right for us.  </li>
            <li> were located right where I didn&#x27;t want the mirror, but again - not the mirror&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li> It has 2 sides and the magnifying side is just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right also,</li>
            <li> Might be worth spending a little more for a better mirror.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price.</li>
            <li> The non-magnified side is great for using with a vanity mirror to check the back of your hair to make sure it&#x27;s not sticking out like alien hands.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Seller had fast shipping and product came exact as described!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The mirror construction is pretty stable and solid, with screws to tighten most joints if they get loosened over time.</li>
            <li> The LNT mirror had several holes for screws, making the mounting more stable.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My wife was against getting this at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and pivots so many different ways.</li>
            <li> Makes applying eye makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
            <li> I use it to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots when buzzing the back of my head.</li>
            <li> And now I have one just like the higher end hotels that we go to regularly  :)</li>
            <li> You can find free standing ones all day, but I wanted my counter clear.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a stud finder especially if the mirror will be moved around ALOT.</li>
            <li> so I could see a little better my finely coiffed hairdo without eyeglasses, but that&#x27;s my problem...</li>
            <li> You have it in other finishes, why not the ever popular Oil Bronze Finish?</li>
            <li> Seems just as good as much more expensive mirrors.  </li>
            <li> This Jerdon is heavy, folds easily and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Mounted in the wooden side of an adjacent cabinet, it went up easily.  </li>
            <li> I got this mirror for my husband to use in a large shower, and he is please with the quality and appearance.</li>
            <li> The mirror swivels smoothly, hangs straight and has clear viewing on both the normal and magnifying sides.</li>
            <li> I didnt mount yet because I need to find out if my wall is secure enough to hold this mirror.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful when getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I find it so much easier to use putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> so I could see the whole backside of my head...</li>
            <li> but once she got it and used it she said this really helps speed up the application of her war paint (make-up).</li>
            <li> Very please.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> MAtches our bronze fixtures very well.</li>
            <li> VERY adjustable.</li>
            <li> When using the 5x side, there is way too much distortion in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Solid, secure.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, a must trying to do makeup with bifocals.</li>
            <li> it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the finish, as it matches my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li> I considered other mirrors, including lighted ones, but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> Much more than any other mirror I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The extending arm mechanism on this mirror was crooked, so it did not extend smoothly, and screeched loudly.</li>
            <li> The main mirror attaches in seconds.</li>
            <li> Or too zoom in on my face with 5x magnification and look at all my facial features really closely, which is actually really useful when trying to shave blurry-eyed in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, it blends right in with our other bronze fixtures, magnifies really really big.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Came missing a screw, but I was able to replace it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most heavy duty</li>
            <li> Bought better wall plugs to hang it with the ones that come with the mirror where a little small and didn&#x27;t seem like they would hold it very securely.</li>
            <li> One advantage of getting a little &#x27;older&#x27; is your eyesight is affected which has an nice automatic &#x27;airbrush&#x27; effect on your face when you look in a regular mirror.  </li>
            <li> I needed one for the newly remodeled master suite.  </li>
            <li> and it is still in like new condition.  </li>
            <li> Just put up my new mirror.  </li>
            <li> 2 years now and still functions and  looks like new.</li>
            <li> it matches all the finishes in my new bathroom and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install, wish arms were a little longer, I wanted to mount to the studs in the wall for the most security, but if the studs are 6\\&quot; too far away, you will still have to lean over your counter a little.</li>
            <li> very clear mirror.....</li>
            <li> Have had the first mirror for several years, and have noticed no rusting as yet.</li>
            <li> I put up my original LNT mirror with 3 screws and anchors in the bracket, and over 6 years of daily use it never moved or wobbled, not even a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Please so far!</li>
            <li> After years and years of using the magnified make-up mirrors in the higher end hotels, I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy one for our master bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Our light fixtures are centered between our double sinks which means one side of my face is always in shadow.  </li>
            <li> Clear.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought a couple of these so far.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend buying this product over the $150 versions in the same color.</li>
            <li> My husband had no trouble putting it up.</li>
            <li> to another home and getting a second one since I miss it so much.</li>
            <li> this will be MUCH easier on my back!</li>
            <li> The swing arm works perfectly, although the sturdyness of it is a little weak, but it&#x27;s just me using it, so I am careful with it.  </li>
            <li> Not an exact match to my bathroom fixtures that are oil brushed bronze, but it is only noticable on cloe inspection.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I have one of these in the main floor bath, in brushed nickel.  </li>
            <li> Had one exactly the same in my last house but had to leave it there.  </li>
            <li> We had to have a way to get close enough to the mirror to insert contact lenses in our new home that was built for people a foot taller than we are.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it may be the regular bronze color; however, this is the Dark Bronze and extends just as far as most other mirrors.</li>
            <li> Coloring was a major concern for me, as everything in our bathroom is bronze</li>
            <li> Right now, the swivel is really tight both on the mirror and arms.  </li>
            <li> After looking high and low decided to get the same one in an oil rubbed bronze finish.  </li>
            <li> It is not a smooth gliding system, and it comes loose from the wall easily.  </li>
            <li> Specifically, the ability to apply makeup without climbing on the counter, as the wall mirror is simply too far away.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side is barely magnified at all.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at the joints, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up over time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hear any bad words during installation, so it was probably pretty easy.</li>
            <li> IF the light is not right, it is hard to see one side of your face.</li>
            <li> Quality is adequate for my needs - only the half-circle of metal to which the mirror is mounted appears to be somewhat thin.  </li>
            <li> We kept putting off installing it as doing so would require a trip to the hardware store, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all-just more trouble than this homely, chintzy thing was worth.</li>
            <li> It swings flat when not required.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to install, just get the height and placement of the unit correct or you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
            <li> It has only two screws (top and bottom), so I am afraid that over time the mirror could wobble against the wall.</li>
            <li> pulled the upper screw and anchor loose.  </li>
            <li> Cheap product that I would never install in our home - almost false advertising as the bronze finish is very low class and the mechanics are very fragile and stiff.</li>
            <li> The place I had to mount the mirror puts it a little far away when I am putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I replaced the anchors that came with it because they had no flange so they screwed in right through the drywall and ended up dangling behind it with the screws attached.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it sagging or coming loose.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and way less expensive than ones I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
            <li> Simple mounting setup, took less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the length of the arm, I wish it was a little longer.</li>
            <li> The magnifying side is a little too up close and personal.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Once mounted its not very level.</li>
            <li> The bronze finish matched all my other fixtures, too.</li>
            <li> No problem with rust or screws not holding as stated by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> I did  not have any of the issues other reviewers had.</li>
            <li> I plan to order another one for my other bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and can not live with out it.  </li>
            <li> The down side, of course, is that the wrinkles and other imperfections</li>
            <li> , I might be a little easier on this product because I was worried about it breaking from the other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dark bronze (almost black) iron wall mirror</li>
            <li> This mirror has the small footprint I need in the limited space I have to attach it.  </li>
            <li> Ordered, spent extra for 1 day shipping--only to receive broken.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a slightly less magnification</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little stiff to shift around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been A little over a month since I bought it</li>
            <li> Took me a little getting use to the magnification.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because I read about some who were having trouble with the arm being too tight.</li>
            <li> Finish hard looking, cheap and ugly.</li>
            <li> I found this mirror on Amazon and it was significantly less expensive than similar items from other companies.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because I wanted a round wall mount in a bronze finish.  </li>
            <li> Fully extended, this puppy is not overly heavy.  </li>
            <li> , doubt was broken during shipment as it was packages in a larger, uncrushed box.  </li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ll mention is that it is heavy.  </li>
            <li> ,  now, after 2 weeks, it seems to be attached firmly with no wiggle (yet)</li>
            <li> The hardware is thin but sturdy enough, just don&#x27;t use it to do chin-ups</li>
            <li> The mirror attaches firmly to the wall</li>
            <li> Wall mount, oil-rubbed bronze magnifying mirrors are not easy to find.</li>
            <li> It was extremely tight when it was installed (I assume the manufacturer did that for shipping/install purposes), but my husband just adjusted the screw in the joint and no problem!</li>
            <li> I am not sure that the Jerdon bracket mounting will hold up as well.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has to do with the steam from shower or what.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, but I don&#x27;t like that it is hard to extend out.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the bronze finish,  </li>
            <li> However, use some common sense and toss the enclosed screws and wall mollys.  </li>
            <li> There are small screw-on bronze pieces that hide the screws!    </li>
            <li> Even with the arm closed to the wall, it&#x27;s awkward.  </li>
            <li> It did become stiff and finally unable to move.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to mount on the wall behind my Camera</li>
            <li> I was tired of leaning over the bathroom sink to put my make up on.  </li>
            <li> The instructions also seemed to be written wrong (aside from referring to parts that weren&#x27;t included).</li>
            <li> Very Sorry I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to turn.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t know about that until I had made holes in my wall and installed it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got one like a garage sale item. Scraches......</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought a couple of these so far.  They do just what you expect and hold-up well.  We&#x27;ve used one for a few years now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I love how it was shipped super fast even if I didnt choose fast delivery. It was secure in its packaging. I didnt mount yet because I need to find out if my wall is secure enough to hold this mirror. it is kind of heavy. overall very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li> Coloring was a major concern for me, as everything in our bathroom is bronze and I wanted a good match. I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful color, and the quality.</li>
            <li> Not an exact match to my bathroom fixtures that are oil brushed bronze, but it is only noticable on cloe inspection.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install and good price.</li>
            <li> This mirror is beautiful to look at on the outside, and so nice to see yourself on the inside with out looking all fuzzy and wierd looking.....very clear mirror.....nice quality.....worth the price. Arm extension is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because I wanted a round wall mount in a bronze finish.  I should have bought the Conair oval wall mount in bronze.  The Jerdon is squeaky and doesn&#x27;t move well.  I have tried loosening and tightening the screws, using WD-40, nothing works.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dark bronze (almost black) iron wall mirror and this one was beyond perfect. I was worried it may be the regular bronze color; however, this is the Dark Bronze and extends just as far as most other mirrors. Its very easy to assemble/mount too. I absolutely recommend buying this product over the $150 versions in the same color.</li>
            <li> The last thing I need for bath remodel. Best price anywhere! All the others I looked at were over $100.00. Finish matches perfect. Great quality.</li>
            <li> A very handy, useful addition to our bathroom.  Shipped on time.  Installed easily.</li>
            <li> A great mirror that mounts easily. A big help for someone who needs to see close up.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Didn&#x27;t want the bulkiness of a lighted mirror and the bronze finish is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have one of these in the main floor bath, in brushed nickel.  I needed one for the newly remodeled master suite.  After looking high and low decided to get the same one in an oil rubbed bronze finish.  I LOVE IT !!  Looked at so many others on line and in person - the lighted mirrors were just TOO BULKY for my taste.  The ease in installation and finished product is WONDERFUL !  I just kept coming back to this model !      You definitely will be happy with this model !!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for the perfect mirror with an oiled bronze finish. I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores. Amazon gave me the best price with FREE shipping! It arrived in only 4 days in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror to go with the oil rubbed bronze already in my bathroom.  I looks great, has a nice finish and does the job!  I Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product and it is what I wanted for the price, I like the length of the arm but it does seem to drop a bit when extended although not from the screws attached to the wall, The mirror already has some specks but aren&#x27;t noticeable up close.  good product not the best.</li>
            <li> Many of these mirrors cost more than three times what this one does.  I&#x27;m thrilled to find such a good value!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The mirror was easy to install and matches the rest of my  bronze bathroom beautifully.    Someone had commented the screws did not match the bronze.   There are small screw-on bronze pieces that hide the screws!    Would definitely buy another one if needed, for myself or  a gift.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, and just what I was looking for. Not as easy to find oil rubbed bronze as you would think. Looks just as pictured, and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> i bought this mirror to match my venetian bronze theme in the bathroom and it blends very nicely.  the mirror is great for putting on makep-up even though i dont have the best lighting.  i use the magnified side the most.  great value for your money.  i did not want to pay the extra money for a mirror with lighting in it and this one works fine.</li>
            <li> this is just the item i was searching for.  the right price, and no shipping.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this on the wall in my bathroom. It&#x27;s to see my hair from the back and still be able to have both hands free. I use the magnification side to put on eye makeup. I like this product and the 5X magnification. Greater magnification would be blurry for me. This wall mirror doesn&#x27;t pull in and out as easily as my last one. However, it&#x27;s quite manageable. The bronze color and size met my expectations. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> An excellent chioce.  Well made, good grade of mirror, not hard to mount.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The oiled bronze matches my faucet and decor.  I&#x27;m glad that I made the purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months and miss it when I travel.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror and the magnification is perfect. It was very easy to install, but came with silver screws, which look tacky. I&#x27;m going to try and find some to match.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  I use this everyday and can not live with out it.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it is still in like new condition.  A must have for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> The mirror is very attractive and works great.  I love the finish which matches my southwestern decor at my river house.  It shows no finger prints like chrome.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews stating there was problems with the swivel hinges but decided to order anyways.  With a level, stud finder and drill in hand, I believe I had this installed in about five minutes. Am pleased with the performance so far but I do have to say, I might be a little easier on this product because I was worried about it breaking from the other reviews I read. I love this mirror and would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror. it is the perfect size and color for our bathroom. My husband had no trouble putting it up. Very happy with the price/quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to mount on a wall in my make up area. It works great for what I need it for! The only thing I would change is the length of the arm, I wish it was a little longer.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, it blends right in with our other bronze fixtures, magnifies really really big.  Perhaps a 3X would be better for me, but I just move back to see better.  Clear mirror, swivels easy, great bargain.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just okay.  It serves the purpose, but I don&#x27;t like that it is hard to extend out.  It is not a smooth gliding system, and it comes loose from the wall easily.  I have to keep tightening the knobs that attach it to the wall braket.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for a wall mirror in the bronze, so I guess I got what I paid for!  Might be worth spending a little more for a better mirror.</li>
            <li> We had to have a way to get close enough to the mirror to insert contact lenses in our new home that was built for people a foot taller than we are.  I found this mirror on Amazon and it was significantly less expensive than similar items from other companies.  Quality is adequate for my needs - only the half-circle of metal to which the mirror is mounted appears to be somewhat thin.  Overall seems like a sturdy item.  Attractive and easy to mount.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Very attractive and looks great on my bathroom wall,  Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> This magnifying mirror is both attractive and a great value.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality, appearance, and function. My husband easily installed the mirror in my dressing room.</li>
            <li> This mirror works fine.  It brings into focus, without the magnifying side, what I need.  Specifically, the ability to apply makeup without climbing on the counter, as the wall mirror is simply too far away.  Mounted in the wooden side of an adjacent cabinet, it went up easily.  It swings flat when not required.  Shipment was fast.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> This mirror seems to be good quality, and was easy to install.  I now have two, with one in each bathroom, and have had no problems whatsoever.  Have had the first mirror for several years, and have noticed no rusting as yet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mirror!  It&#x27;s heavy and very good quality.  It was easy to install, too!  Thanks Amazon for a great product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an extension mirror that was inexpensive &amp; matched my faucets/hardware.  This fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to install &amp; the 5x magnification is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  I didn&#x27;t want the standard gold or silver.  This looks very nice in my bathroom and goes with my decor well.</li>
            <li> Solid   Well built  functional  attractive    Fully extended, this puppy is not overly heavy.  However, use some common sense and toss the enclosed screws and wall mollys.  Instead, drive two three inch screws through the drywall and into a wall stud...  NOW THAT&#x27;S a solid installation that will last for years.</li>
            <li> It works well make from ok parts no issues</li>
            <li> The ORB finish is nice, with some bronze showing through. The mirror construction is pretty stable and solid, with screws to tighten most joints if they get loosened over time. I had a similar mirror in Satin Nickel before from LNT-brand (Linen And Things), and the mounting bracket fit this mirror as well, which was great. I wish the mounting bracket that comes with this Jerdon mirror was better, though. It has only two screws (top and bottom), so I am afraid that over time the mirror could wobble against the wall. The LNT mirror had several holes for screws, making the mounting more stable. I put up my original LNT mirror with 3 screws and anchors in the bracket, and over 6 years of daily use it never moved or wobbled, not even a tiny bit. I am not sure that the Jerdon bracket mounting will hold up as well.</li>
            <li> Mounted it in the bathroom; it gives another &amp;#34;perspective&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At one point, I was convinced I&#x27;d never use a magnified mirror. After all, I&#x27;d just used the bathroom mirror since childhood. This makes shaving incredibly more precise. I no longer have any stray &amp;#34;loner&amp;#34; whiskers. I don&#x27;t use makeup; but, I&#x27;m told that it greatly facilitates that process as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The extending arm mechanism on this mirror was crooked, so it did not extend smoothly, and screeched loudly. Too bad I didn&#x27;t know about that until I had made holes in my wall and installed it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just right for us.  It is the perfect size and works well, even though it doesn&#x27;t come with a light.</li>
            <li> I love having this mirror in my bathroom.  It is very helpful when getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> Ordered, spent extra for 1 day shipping--only to receive broken.  Mirror/Glass cracked 3 ways.  My best guess it left the company this way, doubt was broken during shipment as it was packages in a larger, uncrushed box.  Returning...will try one more time from this co. to see if replacement better taken care of.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and way less expensive than ones I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
            <li> I love having this mirror in the bathroom. Now I don&#x27;t have to lean into the mirror to do my makeup, it swivels to where I need it and I find it so much easier to use putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> nice mirror, but one of the bolts that holds teh mirror around its rotating axis broke after 3 months of usage</li>
            <li> Wife likes the convenience of a magnified mirror on  the wall with which to apply her makeup.  This mirror is regular and 5X magnification.  She wishes it were stronger mag but accepts it as is.  Nice finish. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The mirror came in a nice bronze finish and matches the rest of the bronze elements in my bathroom. The magnified mirror is perfect for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were larger....It is a good size, but I want to use it to cut my hair and I wear glasses, so I would like it to be bigger so I could see the whole backside of my head...</li>
            <li> I love this mirror..  It was easy to install, the color is exactly what I wanted and It makes putting on makeup sooooo much easier.  My only complaint is that it is a little stiff to shift around.  However, that may improve with use.  I would definitely recommend this product and the price was excellent!</li>
            <li> My wife was against getting this at first but once she got it and used it she said this really helps speed up the application of her war paint (make-up).</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy mirror with easy-to-install instructions.  I installed in my guest bathroom and my guests love it.  The bronze finish matched all my other fixtures, too.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these mirrors. They are the very best quality avaliable.So happy they are avaliable in the bronze.</li>
            <li> It just what I was looking for. Thank you love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!! The finish is perfect matches my bathroom fixtures... and is a perfect addition for my makeup area! Very please. Fair price and great product paid less than 25.00 for this mirror and it looks like a 100 product very nice and easy to install! Seller had fast shipping and product came exact as described!</li>
            <li> The color matches my fixtures. Works good on wall mount. Bought better wall plugs to hang it with the ones that come with the mirror where a little small and didn&#x27;t seem like they would hold it very securely. Overall very happy. It&#x27;s been A little over a month since I bought it and it still looks good an works find.</li>
            <li> Great color, looks good in the bathroom. Only flaw is the mirror seems to be a bit distorted - maybe because of the curve of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice finish and perfect for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and swivels perfectly! The color is good and the mirror show EVERY thing!!! So happy with this mirror!</li>
            <li> I had a different wall-mounted makeup mirror for the last 10 years and I wish I had found something like this sooner. It&#x27;s sturdy and pivots so many different ways. It matches my oil rubbed bronze bath fixtures perfectly and looks great in my bathroom. It was a good find!</li>
            <li> Cheap product that I would never install in our home - almost false advertising as the bronze finish is very low class and the mechanics are very fragile and stiff.</li>
            <li> Must have for the bathroom. I use this mirror everyday! I love the finish and the style. This comes in useful so many times. I especially love the magnified side.</li>
            <li> A tremendous value at any price.  The mirror swivels smoothly, hangs straight and has clear viewing on both the normal and magnifying sides.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Looks nice and now I don&#x27;t know how I ever put on makeup without it.  The down side, of course, is that the wrinkles and other imperfections one may not have noticed before are very evident.  The 5X magnification is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great mirror! Makes applying eye makeup so much easier! I wish it extended out just a few more inches, but otherwise it&#x27;s great and looks like it was made to be in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> My husband says it was pain to install but it look great and I love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to install and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great product and as stated! We use this daily... a must for our Master Bath!</li>
            <li> Came missing a screw, but I was able to replace it. Other than that, it up, sturdy thus far, and works great!</li>
            <li> Lightweight and perfect and matches the fixtures in my master bath!</li>
            <li> Great product and easy purchase</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  I have enjoyed this tremendously.  I was completely impressed with the timing of getting my item.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Mounted easily. Love the antique bronze tone. Arrived in good timing &amp; in good condition.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  It has been a fantastic purchase and the price was super for the quality.  Would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to mount on the wall behind my Camera so I could see the LCD display (does not swivel).  It works great, looks great and was easy to install.  I also like that the swivel arm can basically have 2 different distances from source and the mirror has 2-D rotation.  Very Nice!</li>
            <li> Wow love it!!! Very easy install-will not fog up and can see clearly!!! Really love the bronze for the antique look!!</li>
            <li> Installed in bathroom four years ago.  Gets daily use.  No problem with rust or screws not holding as stated by other reviewers.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Nice, well- made  mirror for the price. Tried Conair and it fell apart on the wall! This Jerdon is heavy, folds easily and was easy to install. Wish it had a longer arm to reach farther but it works great otherwise!</li>
            <li> very nice mirror - would work better if I could ever get it hung on the wall</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my daughter&#x27;s bathroom, she love it.  I&#x27;m ordering one just like it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> One advantage of getting a little &#x27;older&#x27; is your eyesight is affected which has an nice automatic &#x27;airbrush&#x27; effect on your face when you look in a regular mirror.  Look into a 5X mirror however and prepare for a shock!  Of course I can&#x27;t blame the mirror for that, otherwise I&#x27;d give it only 1 star.  The mirror itself is very nice, attractive - well made, solid and not cheap at all.  One thing I&#x27;ll mention is that it is heavy.  I replaced the anchors that came with it because they had no flange so they screwed in right through the drywall and ended up dangling behind it with the screws attached.  I got them out, purchased heavy duty ones with flanges and was successful - for about a week when the weight and tension of extending it out [to see if any of my wrinkles magically disappeared] pulled the upper screw and anchor loose.  I decided it was time to find the studs in the wall.  I did this -they were located right where I didn&#x27;t want the mirror, but again - not the mirror&#x27;s fault,  now, after 2 weeks, it seems to be attached firmly with no wiggle (yet) and I have 2 gargantuous holes in the wall to patch, which I&#x27;ll get to after my facelift.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a really nice mirror and anyone with more handy-woman saavy than I would have no problem hanging it right the first time!</li>
            <li> Our light fixtures are centered between our double sinks which means one side of my face is always in shadow.  This mirror has the small footprint I need in the limited space I have to attach it.  It folds away very nicely and the magnification is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror.  It was easy to install and the oil rubbed bronze blends perfect with my bathroom fixtures.  For the money, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> What more can be said, it&#x27;s a mirror and it does what a mirror is supposed to do.  The hardware is thin but sturdy enough, just don&#x27;t use it to do chin-ups and you&#x27;ll be fine.  It is very easy to install, just get the height and placement of the unit correct or you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror.  Great color to match the other oil rubbed bronze items in my bathroom.  Exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> Mounted this to the wall in our re-modeled bathroom. The wife loves it, and it still looks great after 2 years of use!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  I would have paid double for the same quality at Lowe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Clear.</li>
            <li> every man deserves a shaving mirror right in the shower!</li>
            <li> Great little handy mounted mirror.  Kind of wish it had a light, but it still works great and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for what I needed it for. I did  not have any of the issues other reviewers had. It looks very nice for the price, it is quite stable and the magnifyer if great.</li>
            <li> The mirror goes perfectly with my updated bathroom</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror for the cost.  The finish blends right in with my oil rubbed bronze faucet, and looks really nice.  I plan to order another one for my other bathroom.  Highly recommend if you want a nice make up mirror that looks good with bronze decor.  The 5X magnification is perfect for makeup too -- not distorted, but enlarged enough to see good detail.</li>
            <li> Very good product and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the bronze color and is really nice as is opaque and kind of dark (looks very elegant)</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Takes up no counter space. It is mounted at the perfect height for me!</li>
            <li> As one ages, ones eyesight starts to deteriate somewhat and when My wife discovered this item in our &amp;#34;Medalion Hotel&amp;#34; room, she fell in Love with it. I managed to locate it on the internet and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> Very nice bronze mirror for shaving or makeup. Simple mounting setup, took less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror for my husband to use in a large shower, and he is please with the quality and appearance.</li>
            <li> Looks great in my bathroom, perfect for close-up makeup and to see the back of my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted. Took me a little getting use to the magnification.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a bathroom remodel and loved it.  Excellent extension range, good mirror quality.  Makes morning make up routine a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Move to another home and getting a second one since I miss it so much.</li>
            <li> A must have for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Just put up my new mirror.  It&#x27;s very flexible, easy to install, and the magnification is perfect.  I was thinking I&#x27;d have to pay a lot more for this type of mirror and took a chance on this one.  It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m buying another for the guest bathroom today.</li>
            <li> Excellent color I was looking for...bronze.</li>
            <li> Very nice...Great price...Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for. It has 2 sides and the magnifying side is just right. It is nice looking too and matches the rest of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I wish you had an 8X&#x27;S magnification in the oil rubbed bronze finish!!!!!  That&#x27;s the one I need.  You have it in other finishes, why not the ever popular Oil Bronze Finish?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine not having this</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived in a timely manner, as pictured.  The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I need this mirror to shave. works great</li>
            <li> The magnified side is barely magnified at all.</li>
            <li> love this for makeup applications!</li>
            <li> adjusts easily  love it</li>
            <li> This mirror is of great quality and it works perfectly.  I love the finish, as it matches my other bathroom fixtures.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas presents.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It only took 3 mins to mount on the wall.  He loves it.  It makes shaving in the morning a breeze.  He had one that had a stand &amp; hated bending to shave.  This gave him the ability to be at eye level without a problem.  The finish matches perfectly with the rest of the bathroom accessories which was the other reason I bought this one.  He couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the majotr department stores.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> love it it is perfect in every way, great price, fast ship, have it hung up all ready very easy</li>
            <li> 2 years now and still functions and  looks like new. Nice finish on this mirror. MAtches our bronze fixtures very well.</li>
            <li> Recently went on a trip to Mexico and our hotel room had one of these in the bathroom.  It was so convenient and made make-up application a breeze.  Came home, searched Amazon and bought this one. My husband just hung it up today.  Easy to do.  The bronze finish is really nice and rich looking.  Please so far!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most heavy duty but it works just fine and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Looks great, no issues, does its purpose.</li>
            <li> I got this for my master bathroom.  It&#x27;s easy to install and the 5X magnification side is great for putting on make-up or trying to find the eyelash stuck in your eye.  The non-magnified side is great for using with a vanity mirror to check the back of your hair to make sure it&#x27;s not sticking out like alien hands.</li>
            <li> This mirror couldn&#x27;t be easier to install.  Just mark two spots to drill holes and screw into the wall. The main mirror attaches in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had zero issues with this mirror. Installed easily and looks great on the wall. VERY adjustable. I considered other mirrors, including lighted ones, but I&#x27;m glad I got this one. Really good product. Only wish I had purchased it sooner!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and needed. It went up easily and has worked beautifully ever since. I was a little concerned because I read about some who were having trouble with the arm being too tight. It was extremely tight when it was installed (I assume the manufacturer did that for shipping/install purposes), but my husband just adjusted the screw in the joint and no problem! The finish is nice and the product is quality. For this price, I don&#x27;t think I could have done better. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> When using the 5x side, there is way too much distortion in the mirror.  Much more than any other mirror I have owned.  Very Sorry I purchased it.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I was looking for.  It was easy to hang and it goes flush against the wall.  I would not be without this.</li>
            <li> The mirrors were just what I wanted,  They work great for us,  I had a hard time finding the bronze finish,  When I saw these advertised I jumped at it.,  The price was right also,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one.  It&#x27;s very easy to install.  I like that I can swivel it to the angle that I need.</li>
            <li> It was perfect. Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Solid, secure. I use it to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots when buzzing the back of my head. Or too zoom in on my face with 5x magnification and look at all my facial features really closely, which is actually really useful when trying to shave blurry-eyed in the morning.</li>
            <li> The oil rubbed bronze finish on this matched our other bathroom accessories perfectly and the price was much better than some others we looked at.</li>
            <li> This is a fine mirror that doesn&#x27;t swivel very well. Very difficult to turn. Maybe needs WD40. I like the color.</li>
            <li> After years and years of using the magnified make-up mirrors in the higher end hotels, I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy one for our master bathroom.  I purchased one with the same bronze finish as our bathroom fixtures.  I did not purchase one with lights because that would have required some electrical work. I am totally happy with my purchase.  The swing arm works perfectly, although the sturdyness of it is a little weak, but it&#x27;s just me using it, so I am careful with it.  But for the price, I am satisfied.  And now I have one just like the higher end hotels that we go to regularly  :)</li>
            <li> Now I can fix the back of my hair without using hands!</li>
            <li> Worked out perfectly and family came in for the Holiday and suggested they want one now.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount; large; matches my oil rubbed bronze hardware.  Love it!</li>
            <li> We had one of these in silver for quite a while.  We re-did our bathroom with bronze fixtures, so we got the very same one in bronze.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> very nice color, easy to install, looks great in my bathroom</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at the joints, but I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up over time. All metal parts -- No plastic! Yay!!</li>
            <li> I am Satisfied with purchase,  it was a good value for the price. I would recommend it. But would have liked a quicker choice for delivery.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, just wish there was an extension for it.  The place I had to mount the mirror puts it a little far away when I am putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I use the mirror for shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to move it in the right position.  The 5x magnification lets me see everything on my face.  Great mirror!</li>
            <li> A well done product, no imperfections, just what you want to get.</li>
            <li> I searched for quite a while before I settled on this mirror, and it was an excellent choice! The bronze color is a perfect match for my bathroom, and something I was very surprised to be able to find. Magnification is excellent, and the size of the mirror is exactly what I was hoping for. I have been leaning over the sink to apply my makeup for years...this will be MUCH easier on my back! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this to mount in my bathroom and am impressed with the quality of construction.  It looks great, and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Good product. Pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Nice, looks great! Easy to install, wish arms were a little longer, I wanted to mount to the studs in the wall for the most security, but if the studs are 6\\&quot; too far away, you will still have to lean over your counter a little. My wife loves it though!</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect.  Had one exactly the same in my last house but had to leave it there.  The magnification is just right and the color matches perfectly to the rest of my decor.  I would definitely recommend it.  (Easy to put up too).</li>
            <li> Wall mount, oil-rubbed bronze magnifying mirrors are not easy to find. You can find free standing ones all day, but I wanted my counter clear. This one is beautiful. The hinges operate quite smoothly and it folds nicely against the wall.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, but wish I had gotten the one with the light around the mirror.IF the light is not right, it is hard to see one side of your face.</li>
            <li> I use two of these bracketing the vanity mirror to give myself a buzz cut once a month because here in the Great State of South Carolina hair and summers don&#x27;t go together. The magnifying side is a little too up close and personal. I would have preferred a slightly less magnification so I could see a little better my finely coiffed hairdo without eyeglasses, but that&#x27;s my problem...one of many...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find this a very good product once I find a place to put it.  Even with the arm closed to the wall, it&#x27;s awkward.  Not the manufactures fault, that&#x27;s how all of these types are made.  It&#x27;s sturdy, color is correct.  I like that it has the magnification side.  Right now, the swivel is really tight both on the mirror and arms.  This is good for now but we all know over time these things loosen over time.  We&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;ll be hanging it today.</li>
            <li> I was tired of leaning over the bathroom sink to put my make up on.  I wanted something that I could get up close and personal with.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the color of the metal.  Kind of has an antique look which I like.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  The best way to put my makeup on. A must buy.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! it matches all the finishes in my new bathroom and was packaged well.  Arrived intact and promptly.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love this! One of my best purchases. The quality is great and fits in with my high end rubbed bronze fixtures. The magnification is just what you need without being overkill. I can see my entire face while still viewing close enough to find tiny eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE this mirror!!!</li>
            <li> It looks great in my bathroom and as I am getting older I need both sides. My husband likes it too. Only thing, it is starting to squeak when we move it.Not sure if it has to do with the steam from shower or what.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT. IT GIVES YOU TWO SIDES. GREAT MAGINIFICATION. WORKS WELL. EASY TO INSTALL. HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Nicely built, looks nice, and easy to hang.</li>
            <li> Seems just as good as much more expensive mirrors.  It did become stiff and finally unable to move.  My husband took it apart and found it full of shavings.  After cleaning them out it moves freely.  Wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> Mirror and magnification fine. Mounting OK. Finish hard looking, cheap and ugly. But I needed a match with bronze Delta bathroom fixtures. Sort of matches, but quality? Oh well.</li>
            <li> it looked so well designed, super polished....the bronze was beautiful. looks rich. i love it  mounted.....super easy to mount and very sturdy. i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We updated our bathroom to bronze hardware and this swivel mirror is great. Easy to mount, magnification excellent, and beefy quality to it. Can&#x27;t find anything in stores like this.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> The instructions also seemed to be written wrong (aside from referring to parts that weren&#x27;t included). We kept putting off installing it as doing so would require a trip to the hardware store, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all-just more trouble than this homely, chintzy thing was worth. In the end, we donated it to charity.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised. I wish it had 10x magnification, but I knew it was 5x and went with it due to the great price. I didn&#x27;t hear any bad words during installation, so it was probably pretty easy. ;)</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes it. Be sure to use a stud finder especially if the mirror will be moved around ALOT. I would say which one, but its against the rules to advertise inside reviews. But i bought a real good one while shopping for this mirror. :)</li>
            <li> Well made. Well priced. Easy to mount. Absolutely, a must trying to do makeup with bifocals. Love the finish.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price, nothing exceptional.  Once mounted its not very level.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on my makeup before the contacts go in.  I wanted a bronze finish and this is a really nice color.  The mirror attaches firmly to the wall and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it sagging or coming loose.</li>
