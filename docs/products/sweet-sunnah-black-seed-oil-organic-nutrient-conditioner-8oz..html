            <li>It smells just as great as the shampoo does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I loved the way this product separated my curls.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It works well on textured, natural hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>My hair was very easy to comb I also like how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo first and my hair felt great.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma.</li>
            <li>I use the nouirshing oil from this same company and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but I do expect more from a conditioner, like to be able to get a comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was okay,</li>
            <li>I applied another conditioner and rinsed, and my hair felt much better.  </li>
            <li>Takes a bit of working with it to get the right amount and right time to leave on your hair, but it gives good results.  </li>
            <li>I have tightly coiled hair and my hair loved this product!!</li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo and black seed oil from sweet Sunnah perfect combo for hair growth.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s all natural and very healthy for your hair.</li>
            <li>I now use it in combination with a pure moisture conditioner and my results are much better.  </li>
            <li>I have had to go through medical treatments and lost a good portion of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great, light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t dull my hair.</li>
            <li>My  coils were soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend love this product it instantly tamed her split ins soon as she used it.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this conditioner, and the fact that it has no toxic ingredients (parabens, pthalates, sulfates, etc.), but I do not feel that it really conditions very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel that it conditions well.  </li>
            <li>I applied this and it took more than I expected to make my hair coated with it.</li>
            <li>I consider this product more of a treatment for my hair but definitely not a real conditioner..maybe not for relaxed hair anyway.</li>
            <li>all I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean and moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for five years and this is the first conditioner that worked for my hair.</li>
            <li>Before I began using this product I had soft shiny hair with no split ends</li>
            <li>Stripped my hair completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really starting to grow back fast, and healthier, and I believe it&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Really, just not worth the cost.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a less expensive more natural product comparable to Aveda products, but this was not the answer.</li>
            <li> I left it on about 20 minutes and after I rinsed, my hair felt dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been this hydrated in a long time.</li>
            <li> Going to dry again...</li>
            <li> my hair came out very DRY ...</li>
            <li> and now my hair is starting to look dull and dry, and then ends are starting to split.</li>
            <li> It looked shiny but had absolutely no slip.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The bottles are smaller, but I use very little on my medium-length hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in it than other conditions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Hair didn&#x27;t tangle like other conditioners do when massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li> I did buy this for the benefits of the black seed oil</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t want to use half the bottle</li>
            <li> had a hard time getting the comb thru it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
            <li> The smell is atrocious.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>

            <li> I use the nouirshing oil from this same company and have been very happy with it. I purchased the shampoo and it worked well on my hair. The conditioner I add to my sulfate shampoos and it reduces the stripping effect they can have on my hair. It smells just like oil.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this conditioner, and the fact that it has no toxic ingredients (parabens, pthalates, sulfates, etc.), but I do not feel that it really conditions very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did buy this for the benefits of the black seed oil but I do expect more from a conditioner, like to be able to get a comb through my hair.  I don&#x27;t really feel that it conditions well.  Sorry.</li>

            <li> Takes a bit of working with it to get the right amount and right time to leave on your hair, but it gives good results.  Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have had to go through medical treatments and lost a good portion of my hair. It&#x27;s really starting to grow back fast, and healthier, and I believe it&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for five years and this is the first conditioner that worked for my hair. I wish it came in a larger size!  My  coils were soft and easy to detangle. Buying again,</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo first and my hair felt great. I applied this and it took more than I expected to make my hair coated with it.

            <li> I just tried this for the first time today. A little goes a long way all I can say is WOW!!! amazed by results after one use so I can only imagine with continued use. Hair didn&#x27;t tangle like other conditioners do when massaging your scalp. The smell isn&#x27;t to bad either. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this hydrated in a long time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Giving it to the homeless shelter.Stripped my hair completely.</li>
