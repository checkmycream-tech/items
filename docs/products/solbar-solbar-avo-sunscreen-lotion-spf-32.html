            <li>it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly on the skin.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also very light).  </li>
            <li>My daughter who is 18 months has an allergic reaction to most sunscreens but not this.  </li>
            <li>Have used it many years.  </li>
            <li>I spend many hours outdoors and have not had issues with sun burn if I have this on.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>We have used this product for several years now and think it&#x27;s the best.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen; it gives great protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it and now both my mom and I enjoy it too!  </li>
            <li>You will love the creamy texture as it is somewhat moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist prescribed this sunscreen and I love it because it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>But overall a great value and product!</li>
            <li>This simply the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I like this the best in terms of (1) actual results on sunny outdoor days and (2) how easily and comfortably it goes on.  </li>
            <li>It protects very well - and I have fair skin-</li>
            <li>It goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, unoffensive smell, and lasts..</li>
            <li>Plus it does not have a strong smell or greasy feel.</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I immediately liked it for it&#x27;s fragrance-free, grease-free, sticky-free feel.  </li>
            <li>here Solbar works fine for me</li>
            <li>It was such a great beginning.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, odor free, and seems to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>The stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t buy it here, you have to special order it from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>More importantly, my highly allergic skin took to it well.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no excessive buildup when I apply makeup on top.</li>
            <li>We like the clear liquid better that the cream.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>Ordering another right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now, and so far, so good - no itchy, scaly, red bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>It works fabulous and doesn&#x27;t irriate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No weird sunscreen smell, either.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars, as I would LOVE to find such a product with a higher SPF, but have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I discovered this sunscreen about a year ago and have been glad to purchase it by mail-order, several bottles at a time, ever since.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to find a product for my 13 year old son that is extremely sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li>I play golf a lot and it is very sunny and hot</li>
            <li>Easy to use as a daily product, will not be greasy or stain clothes.</li>
            <li>and you DO NOT get that white zombie face thing that can come with some strong sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin and don&#x27;t care much for scented, sticky, pore-plugging types of sunscreen, then this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended that I use this and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect sunscreen if you have delicate skin, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I wish they would add a little zinc to it for better sun protection.  </li>
            <li>The only sunscreen I will use on my red hair grandchildren who otherwise would easily get sunburned.</li>
            <li>I live in florida</li>
            <li>Especially good for face neck and ears since its a little expensive...</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, not greasy, and</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the Blue Lizard for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable compred to other high-end sun screens.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Best sunscreen ever.  Does not irritate skin and you DO NOT get that white zombie face thing that can come with some strong sunscreens.  I am a very white person and I use every day under my makeup. (yes I use a a sunscreen and make up as the sunscreen in your makeup is not enough!!!)  I do put another coat on before I go out in the sun if it is later in the day and I put mine on in the morning.  I really like this.  It does burn if you get it in your eyes, but not like some of the others.  My dermatologist recommends this one and it is three dollars cheaper here than his office.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for several years including when I went on caribbean cruises and never got a sunburn.  My daughter who is 18 months has an allergic reaction to most sunscreens but not this.  It works fabulous and doesn&#x27;t irriate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have used it many years.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It was such a great beginning. But then it deteriorated into something totally unlikeable. Would not have started it if I had known. Totally overrated.</li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen all the time because of the immune suppressants i take due to a kidney transplant. Solbar does not feel heavy or sticky. No weird sunscreen smell, either.</li>
            <li> I started using this sunscreen after my father&#x27;s dermatologist told me that she uses it.  It is hard to find in the stores, so this time around I ordered it online and it was here in two days.  It disappears on the skin quickly, has no scent,  and is very effective.  I spend many hours outdoors and have not had issues with sun burn if I have this on.  I do notice it&#x27;s presence when I go to wash my face, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a product for my 13 year old son that is extremely sensitive to most products.  This one did not work.  I ended up buying the Blue Lizard for sensitive skin and I love it.  We&#x27;ll see if this works for another family member.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years on the recommendation of a dermatologist.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a scent to draw bugs.  It is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation also.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for several years now and think it&#x27;s the best.  We like the clear liquid better that the cream.  Seems to do an excellent job whether in florida, the islands in the winter or in the north during the summer months.  No oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, as recommended by Dermatologist.  I am a golfer and beach lover, and do not burn.</li>
            <li> Provides excellent sun protection. The only sunscreen I will use on my red hair grandchildren who otherwise would easily get sunburned.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen; it gives great protection from the sun. I use it over my moisturizer and under my makeup.  It feels creamy, but not sticky.  My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it and now both my mom and I enjoy it too!  It&#x27;s a safe product without fragrance and Pabas!</li>
            <li> prescribed by my doctor, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This was recommended long ago by our dermatologist and I have used it for at least 10 years.  I am very fair and I put this on under my makeup with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and years on my face every morning. I like that it&#x27;s very light so there&#x27;s no excessive buildup when I apply makeup on top.</li>
            <li> I play golf a lot and it is very sunny and hot here Solbar works fine for me</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermotologist and I wear it all the time.  Not greasy, odor free, and seems to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now, and so far, so good - no itchy, scaly, red bumps on my face.  Goes on clear, not greasy, and good base for make up (I use mineral powder).  I gave it 4 stars, as I would LOVE to find such a product with a higher SPF, but have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Of all of the facial moisturizing sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, this does not leave a milky white coating on my face.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this and it works very well.  We sat out at a concert last summer and I forgot my hat.  I didn&#x27;t even get pink!  This stuff really works.  You will love the creamy texture as it is somewhat moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started wearing sunscreen on my face daily and have tried about 10 different products.  I like this the best in terms of (1) actual results on sunny outdoor days and (2) how easily and comfortably it goes on.  (3) Price.  Its a little more expensive than most of the high volume commercial products but much less expensive than the high end niche products.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin (arms, hands (top), and ears) itch pretty badly if exposed to the sun for too long and breaks out in little bumps. I do not tan or burn. I itch. It&#x27;s very annoying but this sunscreen is perfect. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good sunscreen for a while now. I live in florida so I should wear sunscreen daily but haven&#x27;t because they all burn my face.. I put this on and it gave me no irritation!! Woohoo! Plus it does not have a strong smell or greasy feel. I think my search is finally over!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 12 years. Works well under make up. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is wonderful, non greasy, easy to apply, excellent protection, highly recommended this for any one looking for a good value</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this sunscreen and I love it because it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunscreen if you have delicate skin, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The way I discovered this sunscreen was from a sample at my dermatologist. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been buying this product online. It goes on very smoothly on the skin. No white, thick product. It protects very well - and I have fair skin- so I need all the protection I can get. Easy to use as a daily product, will not be greasy or stain clothes. I like this sunscreen a lot.</li>

Although the price may seem like a bit much, it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever come across in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and my dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me.  It protects and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I use it on my hands, arms and face.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it clogging my pores.  If you don&#x27;t buy it here, you have to special order it from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, much better than run of the mill sun screens.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is reasonable compred to other high-end sun screens. This product was recommended to us by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It goes on easily. it&#x27;s not greasy and it does not make my face all white.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I had been using Lamcome on my face and I think I became allergic to it.  Solbar is great for roseacea prone skin.  Ordering another right now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that makes your skin glow.  If you like a matte finish, you won&#x27;t like it.  I wish they would add a little zinc to it for better sun protection.  But overall a great value and product!</li>
            <li> This simply the best sunscreen I have ever used. Goes on easy, unoffensive smell, and lasts..Especially good for face neck and ears since its a little expensive...</li>
