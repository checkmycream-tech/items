            <li>what more do I want!!!!!!!     </li>
            <li>(Smelled delicious too!)</li>
            <li>Best home hair color</li>
            <li>The color is BEAUTIFUL too!!</li>
            <li>Great hair color!!  </li>
            <li>This works great!</li>
            <li>Even though I got something that was supposed to be great for your hair, after two uses my hair felt like straw.  </li>
            <li>Happy with this product, prompt delivery, will order again.</li>
            <li>Good color ,looks great, revitalizes your hair.</li>
            <li>Under the lights in one bathroom it looked a pleasant medium brown - fairly neutral with a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li>Loved the color.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great too in that it is not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or flattening like most.  </li>
            <li>Quite nice.</li>
            <li>My own hair, however, was not.  </li>
            <li>It really was gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>but it contains a much more damaging substitute.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair from strangers and my hairstylists.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this hair coloring company.</li>
            <li>Many brands are just as unsafe.  </li>
            <li>Great multi-dimension color (not flat matte color), leaves my rather fine hair with a bit more body and in 30 minutes perfectly covers my 90% white hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a safe over- the- counter color system yet, but the ammonia- free Ion brand from Sally&#x27;s keeps out parabens, ammonia &amp; PPDs.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased (no itchy scalp) with the results and found Naturtint&#x27;s website very informative with their FAQ&#x27;s, How to Apply and Our Models sections.</li>
            <li>- Condition was fine.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the redder colors, but now I just stick with the Light Chestnut color.  </li>
            <li>And the one thing that is really important to me is, integrity</li>
            <li>And it is natural &amp; good for the enviroment as well....</li>
            <li>This brand actually makes your hair feel MORE CONDITIONED than before you dye it!!</li>
            <li>So good to see Amazon carries this, because I use a popular color and it sells out quickly to my local natural food stores.</li>
            <li>Shiney, soft and rich!!</li>
            <li>Long lasting, and it makes your hair feel great!</li>
            <li>I tried this once before this purchase for the 1st time, I completely love how it covers, colors (natural looking color) &amp; leaves my hair</li>
            <li>I mix this with the 6N to get the right shade.</li>
            <li>as I really don&#x27;t like it!  </li>
            <li>I find that it also lasts a long time before a touch up is needed which is great &amp; economical in the long run.</li>
            <li>The safest over-the-counter at- home hair color I&#x27;ve found so far is Ion Ammonia-Free &amp; PPD- Free hair colors and developers.  </li>
            <li>so I am able to split the contents and make each box last for two hair colorings.</li>
            <li>I used 70% Naturtint 5N (Light Chestnut Brown) with 30% 5G (Golden Chestnut Brown) on my fine light-medium brown hair with golden highlights and a few greys.  </li>
            <li>Ion&#x27;s 18v didn&#x27;t lift at all, so it&#x27;s probably only good for deposit only.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s a very nice chestnut color without all the red tinge that my hair used to pick up from other haircolor brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very true to the picture, covered my grey and is more natural than the regular salon stuff.</li>
            <li>It seems that the whole Naturtint brown range carry this risk of redness.  </li>
            <li>I have very stubborn gray hair and this product did not cover them well.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years as I gave up on many other name brands that I have used throughout my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>After using other brands her hair became very brittle and dry, so I was on a look for a more natural alternative that would hold but not damage her hair any more.</li>
            <li>I use one box on my long hair and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, there appear to be no truly neutral or golden brown shades available (as at mid-2011), though perhaps they do turn out that way on some people(?).</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair color at a natural food store,  (for much higher cost than the price this carrier shows).  </li>
            <li>Well as far as coming close to my own natural color, it sure did, and that is a first for me; usually I get red  tones resulting from the other products, (which I do not like at all).  </li>
            <li>I started using it a year back for my very long hair &amp; have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the same gripe I&#x27;ve had since I started coloring my hair, using other brands as well); my hair tends to be oily, and I must shampoo it more often if I use a gentle shampoo, I would prefer not to because as with any color, shampoo can strip the color prematurely.  </li>
            <li>It covers my gray hair beautifully, and there is a small bottle of conditioner included, it makes your hair very soft, not feeling like dried straw like some products do.  </li>
            <li>It covers the gray and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I loved it from the moment I applied it; no awful smell, it did drip a little, but no more than any other hair color brand does.  </li>
            <li>oh so soft &amp; silky!</li>
            <li>No smell, easy to use, green technology</li>
            <li>To resolve that, I purchase the \\&quot;MULTIPLIER\\&quot; conditioner separately and just mix the shampoo with a clear clarifying shampoo to extend it.  </li>
            <li>I also use Natural chestnut color 4N</li>
            <li>So far, this is it.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels and look alive again and the color holds well.</li>
            <li>No heavy metals.</li>
            <li>, it has to look as close to my natural hair color as it can.  </li>
            <li>When I first started coloring my hair, I just went to the local big box store and bought one of the well known brands.  </li>
            <li>- Grey coverage was reasonable.</li>
            <li>My hair feels well conditioned, full and fluffy after I use this.  </li>
            <li>You really need to use a gentle shampoo though, as with any hair color, a harsh detergent shampoo will remove it sooner; but even with that, the ends of my hair, have not faded at all.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thick and just touches the shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The price is usually a little high, but I am not a person that goes to the salon all of the time, so it really isn&#x27;t so unreasonable under those circumstances.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, the blonde natural bristle brush with which I applied it turned an absolutely glorious colour - a rich and dimensional very dark brown with chocolate and gold highlights, and no red.  </li>
            <li>Not brilliant, but OK.  </li>
            <li>; when there is less than a certain amount in there?</li>

            <li> ; when there is less than a certain amount in there?</li>
            <li> I could not live with the redness and one week later ended up using Tints of Nature 4N (Medium Brown) to try to cover it.  </li>
            <li> BUT in the other bathroom and under various other lighting conditions my hair had an obvious red shine.  </li>
            <li> I recomment this product, but if your hair is long, purchase a separate bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair felt extremely dry after I colored it</li>
            <li> This brand does not burn your skin or dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li> This produced a dark brown result and did succeed in subduing the red by about 70%.</li>
            <li> That is, not copper, not chestnut, certainly not \\&quot;golden\\&quot; - any of which would have been OK - but RED, of the &#x27;bad hair dye&#x27; ilk.  </li>
            <li> And, the gray roots around my temples came back less than 1 week after I colored it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every imaginable colorant from over-the-counter brands to various salons over the past 20 years, and this is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the little packet of shampoo and conditioner that comes with it has \\&quot;shrunk\\&quot; over the years and even with my hair, it is not enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> With other hair coloring products, the smell always gives me a headache while coloring my hair, and makes my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have alot of gray and this product covers it extremely well.</li>
            <li> The monthly) salon visits were getting expensive (my hair grows fast)</li>
            <li> Has lasted at least 4 weeks on my 80% grey head!!</li>
            <li> It also lasts 3 times longer than any other brand I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Yes, the main dangerous chemicals that I recognize in this color product is PPDs, Resorcinols &amp; Ammonia.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Brands that eliminate ammonia usually add MEAs in its place.  </li>
            <li> it was so thin it just dripped off my hair.</li>
            <li> and it was breaking off like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;d be afraid to use anything else.</li>
            <li> These are dangerous chemicals to be putting on your skin/ scalp.</li>
            <li> and they are just as laden w/ dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner that came with it was worthless...</li>

            <li> I started using it a year back for my very long hair &amp; have fallen in love with it. I keep it on for 30 min.&amp; I am done for 15-20days.  No smell, easy to use, green technology what more do I want!!!!!!!     I also use Natural chestnut color 4N</li>
            <li> I used 70% Naturtint 5N (Light Chestnut Brown) with 30% 5G (Golden Chestnut Brown) on my fine light-medium brown hair with golden highlights and a few greys.  Results:  - Condition was fine.  - Grey coverage was reasonable. Not brilliant, but OK.  - Colour was a mixed issue.  Under the lights in one bathroom it looked a pleasant medium brown - fairly neutral with a hint of warmth. Quite nice. BUT in the other bathroom and under various other lighting conditions my hair had an obvious red shine.  That is, not copper, not chestnut, certainly not \\&quot;golden\\&quot; - any of which would have been OK - but RED, of the &#x27;bad hair dye&#x27; ilk.  Oddly, the blonde natural bristle brush with which I applied it turned an absolutely glorious colour - a rich and dimensional very dark brown with chocolate and gold highlights, and no red.  Go figure!  Goes to show how differently various hair types can take colour.  It really was gorgeous!  My own hair, however, was not.  I could not live with the redness and one week later ended up using Tints of Nature 4N (Medium Brown) to try to cover it.  This produced a dark brown result and did succeed in subduing the red by about 70%. (Smelled delicious too!) Hopefully the remaining red will eventually wash out(?) as I really don&#x27;t like it!  It seems that the whole Naturtint brown range carry this risk of redness.  Oddly, there appear to be no truly neutral or golden brown shades available (as at mid-2011), though perhaps they do turn out that way on some people(?).</li>
            <li> My hair felt extremely dry after I colored it and it was breaking off like crazy. The conditioner that came with it was worthless...it was so thin it just dripped off my hair. And, the gray roots around my temples came back less than 1 week after I colored it. Don&#x27;t be fooled this may be ammonia-free but it contains a much more damaging substitute.</li>
            <li> I buy this one for my mom. After using other brands her hair became very brittle and dry, so I was on a look for a more natural alternative that would hold but not damage her hair any more. So far, this is it. Her hair feels and look alive again and the color holds well.</li>
            <li> I tried this once before this purchase for the 1st time, I completely love how it covers, colors (natural looking color) &amp; leaves my hair oh so soft &amp; silky! And it is natural &amp; good for the enviroment as well.... Both times I purchased Lt. Chestnut Brown (5N) &amp; it&#x27;s a very nice chestnut color without all the red tinge that my hair used to pick up from other haircolor brands. I find that it also lasts a long time before a touch up is needed which is great &amp; economical in the long run. I will continue to purchase &amp; use this haircolor in the future. I hope Amazon continues to carry it!</li>
            <li> Loved the color. Has lasted at least 4 weeks on my 80% grey head!! I will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Best home hair color I have ever found. No heavy metals.</li>
            <li> When I first started coloring my hair, I just went to the local big box store and bought one of the well known brands.  Even though I got something that was supposed to be great for your hair, after two uses my hair felt like straw.  A coworker turned me on to this brand and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!!  I get so many compliments on my hair from strangers and my hairstylists.  Does not cause damage and my hair is softer after I use it.  I use one box on my long hair and it works fine.  I used to use the redder colors, but now I just stick with the Light Chestnut color.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair color at a natural food store,  (for much higher cost than the price this carrier shows).

So good to see Amazon carries this, because I use a popular color and it sells out quickly to my local natural food stores.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and as described.</li>
            <li> I have tried every imaginable colorant from over-the-counter brands to various salons over the past 20 years, and this is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  It covers the gray and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair coloring company. With other hair coloring products, the smell always gives me a headache while coloring my hair, and makes my scalp itch. With this company&#x27;s product, I had no reaction what so ever. I will always use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years as I gave up on many other name brands that I have used throughout my lifetime.  This brand actually makes your hair feel MORE CONDITIONED than before you dye it!! This brand does not burn your skin or dry out your hair.  My hair feels well conditioned, full and fluffy after I use this.  My hair is fine and thick and just touches the shoulders.  My only complaint is that the little packet of shampoo and conditioner that comes with it has \\&quot;shrunk\\&quot; over the years and even with my hair, it is not enough to do the job.  Hair color, yes.  Shampoo and Conditioner, no.  To resolve that, I purchase the \\&quot;MULTIPLIER\\&quot; conditioner separately and just mix the shampoo with a clear clarifying shampoo to extend it.  The conditioner is great too in that it is not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or flattening like most.  I recomment this product, but if your hair is long, purchase a separate bottle of conditioner. Hope this helps!! OH!!! The color is BEAUTIFUL too!! Shiney, soft and rich!! It also lasts 3 times longer than any other brand I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Great hair color!!  Works well...does not damage hair...</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn gray hair and this product did not cover them well.</li>
            <li> This works great! I mix this with the 6N to get the right shade. It&#x27;s very true to the picture, covered my grey and is more natural than the regular salon stuff. I do still smell a hint of ammonia in this stuff, though, so am thinking they are allowed to say &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34; when there is less than a certain amount in there? Not sure. But something still had a bit of that smell.</li>
            <li> Good color ,looks great, revitalizes your hair. I&amp;#34;d be afraid to use anything else. Long lasting, and it makes your hair feel great!</li>
            <li> Yes, the main dangerous chemicals that I recognize in this color product is PPDs, Resorcinols &amp; Ammonia.  These are dangerous chemicals to be putting on your skin/ scalp. I would never use this product. The safest over-the-counter at- home hair color I&#x27;ve found so far is Ion Ammonia-Free &amp; PPD- Free hair colors and developers.  Ion comes in semi, demi &amp; permanant. The Ammonia-free line of Ion Developers are also Paraben-Free! I have reviews written on Ion color &amp; developers- I&#x27;ve used them all, even their products w/ low ammonia and parabens. Any ammonia in a hair color gives me an allergic reaction. Ion&#x27;s 18v didn&#x27;t lift at all, so it&#x27;s probably only good for deposit only.  I&#x27;ve also purchased Paul Mitchell salon brand color &amp; developer (will be returning) and they are just as laden w/ dangerous chemicals.  Many brands are just as unsafe.  Brands that eliminate ammonia usually add MEAs in its place.  I haven&#x27;t found a safe over- the- counter color system yet, but the ammonia- free Ion brand from Sally&#x27;s keeps out parabens, ammonia &amp; PPDs.

            <li> I have been buying and using Naturtint for over a year now.  I have alot of gray and this product covers it extremely well. The monthly) salon visits were getting expensive (my hair grows fast) and since I&#x27;m retired I am watching my budget.  I also wanted to get away from the peroxide based hair products that my salon was using that made my scalp burn and itch during the entire time it was processing.  I am very pleased (no itchy scalp) with the results and found Naturtint&#x27;s website very informative with their FAQ&#x27;s, How to Apply and Our Models sections. I am currently combining 2 oz of the Naturtint 5N and 5G for medium brown with reddish gold highlights. My hair is medium length so I am able to split the contents and make each box last for two hair colorings.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product, prompt delivery, will order again.</li>
            <li> Great multi-dimension color (not flat matte color), leaves my rather fine hair with a bit more body and in 30 minutes perfectly covers my 90% white hair.</li>
