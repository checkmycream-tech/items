            <li>they should have packed it better.</li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed so it may work better with relaxed hair than virgin hair.</li>
            <li>Great in natural hair. !</li>
            <li>Works great, but effect does not last all day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Hicks smooth edges for about 6 months now,  it consistently keeps my edges smooth even through the hot DC summers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your edges will be straight and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>Havent found anything that works better on natural hair.</li>
            <li>My edges looks freshly relaxed without any flakes, or gummy look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It really hold down my hair and gives it a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love, Tried other edge controllers and they didn&#x27;t last a hour, then turned hair</li>
            <li>Its better to buy it from here at a 2 pack ...if you buy it seperate it will cost double.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist, and I use hicks daily my clients and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the dust and dirt that some of the other products tend to hold in your hair.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have ordered two more, one for my self as a back up, and one for my daughter</li>
            <li>I have not had a relaxer for 4 months and it lays my edges down nicely.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>, she loves it too, it really holds down our edges nicely.</li>
            <li>It certainly does the job</li>
            <li>thanks b</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on relaxed edges but tends to get greasy after its set on hair for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I notice even better results when my hair is slightly damp and it has helped my edges to grow as well.  </li>
            <li>Great product for laying down African American textured hair!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>white.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple applications take a wet towel and clean your edges then apply again.</li>
            <li>It holds natural hair as well and doesn&#x27;t curl up a as quick as other edge controllers.</li>
            <li>The pomade of choice for my 4a natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair and after washing my hair, I used this product to put my hair in a bun</li>
            <li>My hair stayed soft &amp; the bun lasted for a week.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that the texture and appearance is totally different from the previous ones purchased not through Amazon which is most likely why it does not slick or straighten my edges which is the desired result.</li>
            <li>I love this Pomade, it does what it says, however it will look a little ashy or white when I use it the second or third day</li>
            <li>This is the only product that works quick when applied and last longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Be careful of using too much product.</li>
            <li>It REALLY holds down</li>

            <li> I wanted to look for this because other gels cake up and this one is really hard to find, but once again Amazon comes through.  </li>
            <li> No strong odors from this product &amp; no flaky build up.</li>
            <li> No better than what is already at Walmart and beauty supply stores.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to slick my edges.</li>
            <li> This holds edges DOWN!!!  </li>
            <li> one of the containers was broken when i received it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but to me</li>
            <li> but I eas not expecting it to be an oil base.</li>

            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for edges.  I have not had a relaxer for 4 months and it lays my edges down nicely. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hicks smooth edges for about 6 months now,  it consistently keeps my edges smooth even through the hot DC summers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the only edge control product that does not leave a cakey white residue after I use it. I have purchased this for my niece you loves it as well. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It REALLY holds down stubburn edges</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and naturally curly -I have used product for over 5 years and it beats all other holding gels</li>
            <li> Ordered this edge control on a Thursday and received it Friday morning. The only edge control I&#x27;ll use for my edges!</li>
            <li> Had it applied to my hair at a hair show so I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have natural 3c/4a hair and after washing my hair, I used this product to put my hair in a bun and my hair looked like I had a relaxer!

            <li> I like this stuff, even though it does not last all day for me.</li>
            <li> I been using this for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> love the product! one of the containers was broken when i received it...they should have packed it better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to look for this because other gels cake up and this one is really hard to find, but once again Amazon comes through.  I found this and had to get a couple of them.  I got them in just days after I ordered them.  Thanks Amazon.  Excellent product and delivery service.</li>
            <li> This Best at temp straighten and holding ! A must have for styling! I use this daily on my hair as well as my daughters</li>
            <li> Great product! Not very oily like other brands.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver for my edges....wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Tames edges without flaking or residue. I am a repeat customer of this product and highly recommend this wonderful hair care item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now. It&#x27;s expensive but to me it&#x27;s worth it. I like buying 2 at a time since I use it every day. This is the only product that works quick when applied and last longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is relaxed so it may work better with relaxed hair than virgin hair. But even with relaxed hair not all edgers work. Now I only use it for my front edges. I do not use it for upsweep hair styles. You will need a stronger gel for that. In my opinion, if you just want your edges to look smoother when you pull your hair back in a ponytail, then this product will do the job. Your edges will be straight and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past, but Edges does it for me. My edges lay down and stays for an entire day. Another benefit is that it smells and feels good.</li>
            <li> Great product for laying down African American textured hair!! It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Works really well on relaxed edges but tends to get greasy after its set on hair for awhile.  It holds natural hair as well and doesn&#x27;t curl up a as quick as other edge controllers. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this Pomade, it does what it says, however it will look a little ashy or white when I use it the second or third day, I just wet  a.wash cloth with warm water and wipe around my hair line in the front where I used the product and then reapply it. That way I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair too often. I like it so much that I have ordered two more, one for my self as a back up, and one for my daughter, she loves it too, it really holds down our edges nicely. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using this on her hair. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the dust and dirt that some of the other products tend to hold in your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product to slick my edges. This was my go to product for over four years. I have coarse, thick hair (not chemically straightened) and this product usually does wonders in slicking my edges without the need of heat application. However, I noticed that the texture and appearance is totally different from the previous ones purchased not through Amazon which is most likely why it does not slick or straighten my edges which is the desired result. I tend to get undesired results with every application (e.g., white flaky build up and coarse edges). I am truly upset that I have two containers of this product that do not work. I will not be purchasing again. I would love to hear others&#x27; comments about this product and whether or not they share my experience!</li>
