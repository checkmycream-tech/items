            <li> Many people have complained of this being to dark?</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, both positive and negative and purchased it anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only downside is after several hours I&#x27;m a little oily/shiny</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts.</li>
            <li> you should buy it its so essy to apply and  little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Matte It last long going on very small</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this at first, but i decided if it didn&#x27;t work than</li>
            <li> I seen the other reviews about this bronzer being dark.</li>
            <li> and I was worried to be too dark bcoz</li>
            <li> It is not as dark as it appears on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is superr dark.</li>
            <li> so I think this bronzer is kinda orange for me, but just a little bit.</li>
            <li> it is very dark pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was browsing for matte bronzers a few days ago and came accross</li>
            <li> Makes you look few shades darker but its not one of those caked on feeling/looking bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I hate the shimmery stuff because it makes you look a little trashy under direct sunlight, a matte finish definitely gives you a classier look than shimmery bronzer would.</li>
            <li> Im very pale and this worked for me</li>
            <li> but I was wrong..</li>

            <li> New favorite! I&#x27;ve been searching for a good bronzer and this is it! It blends like a dream, doesn&#x27;t make me muddy, and lasts all day. This can be used as a contour and a bronzer. My skin is a pale tan color and deep is a great shade for me. Nyx rocks!!</li>
            <li> I seriously love it.. and I was worried to be too dark bcoz I&#x27;m medium skin tone but I was wrong.. it&#x27;s really good. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it gets too powdery when you swipe the brush in it.</li>
            <li> Love the matte bronzers, and this one is no different.  It is buildable, and blends very well.  I am a matte bronzer girl, shimmer doesn&#x27;t look good on women over 40, in my opinion.  This one is very blendable and smooth.  Would recommend to matte lovers.</li>

            <li> Matte indeed! I&#x27;m Asian with tan skin, and this shade works well for me, it blends right with my skin tone and it looks natural. My boyfriend thought I lost weight on my face because I used this to contour my cheekbone. Haha. So worth the money, definitely recommend. I hate the shimmery stuff because it makes you look a little trashy under direct sunlight, a matte finish definitely gives you a classier look than shimmery bronzer would.</li>
