            <li> I use this almost every day and have for several years. I don&#x27;t like using a lot of chemicals on my body- especially the ones I can&#x27;t pronounce.  This product is NOT an anti-perspirant and there is a difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant.  The latter stops sweating or nearly stops it but a deodorant stops it from smelling unpleasant.  The only time I use an antiperspirant is for something very stressful on a warm day in a social situation where my nerves my be shot.  Every other day, Dermalogica Control Deodorant is completely adequate for my needs even through the summer.  It has a light pleasant scent, goes on clear, has not stained my clothing, and I&#x27;ve been pleased to say it lasts a very long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day for years and I&#x27;m only halfway through my second purchase. That&#x27;s economical to me.</li>
            <li> OK, but not great. There are better products available, but nothing wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever!  Good for dark pigmented skin tone and sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> Love this product and continue to use it as it does not have the chemicals that regular over the counter products use, such a aluminum.</li>
            <li> If avoiding aluminum AND performance is what you&#x27;re after, this deodorant is for you.  While it IS expensive, it will last a while, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a deodorant that would not melt while in my workout bag, sitting in my car in the hot sun.  Other stick types melt and make a mess.  This doesnt, I just keep the plastic cover over the product and then screw the lid on tight and it is completely intact when I take it out.  The other plus is as stated in other reviews, doesn&#x27;t irritate and smells good (I think so).</li>
            <li> I went to a spa at a Sandals resort and was given this as my free gift....at first I was like \\&quot;Oh joy, deodorant\\&quot;, but then I decided to try it. I was amazed! All my life I would get underarm smell in hot weather. No deodorant worked and I tried a ton!This is the only one that has ever eliminated the smell! I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who has tried everything else.The smell is just ok, so I usually  put a pretty smelling deodarant on over it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Even Vichy (sensitive) deodorant after few days makes me itch like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a while now and i love that it does irritate my skin. The fragrance is mild (i don&#x27;t like strong fragrance because it starts to smell bad after a while) which for me is great.&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant itself is a clear gel like substance. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;After a long day you may need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Smells clean without being overpowering. Leaves no residue or powder. Small, compact form factor. Have tried several other deodorants before settling on this one.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best deodorant available.  In an effort to avoid antiperspirant, I found this alternative years ago and have never looked back.  It does make you a little vulnerable to the &amp;#34;pit out&amp;#34; but not nearly as much as other all natural deodorants.  Dermalogica really figured it out and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no rash, smells great, and it smells great, what I really like is that is smells great, but if there was one thing you should know, it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is by far thee best deoderant I have used. I&#x27;ve been looking for a deoderant without the aluminum in it, but there aren&#x27;t very many out there that truly do &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; contain the &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34;... I also enjoy the scent. It&#x27;s really pleasant, not too over powering.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love how this product works for me, even when I&#x27;m active and moving around.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant for two reasons - first, because I hate the idea of the aluminum and other chemicals in traditional deodorant, and second, because I have extremely sensitive skin and traditional deodorant was causing my skin to peel and become irritated. I was very concerned about spending so much for a single stick of deodorant, but so far I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I&#x27;ve done several hard core workouts with this deodorant and had no issues with body odor. My only small negative is that the scent seems masculine to me, but it&#x27;s a small drawback, considering I&#x27;m not lathered in aluminum and my skin is no longer peeling! It&#x27;s effective and I will continue using it for as long as I can get my hands on it!</li>
            <li> it is good at home but if you travel be carful it melts all over your other products.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY clear deodorant I can use...I am allergic to all the others.  Works great and easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to reapply if I get sweaty. Since this has no anti-perspirant function I still sweat which then brings on the need for a reapplication before the day is over. I also find that it doesn&#x27;t last me through the day though I wonder if it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t slather it on. It&#x27;s a mild inconvenience that I tolerate because I&#x27;d rather not use something toxic on my body. It seems to last a while, offsetting the high price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.  I really like the smell, and it is gentle on skin.  I have a high-demand job where I tend to sweat a lot, and this just didn&#x27;t hold up.  I tried applying it both at bedtime and in the morning, but I was still stinky at work, and I don&#x27;t have time to be re-applying this multiple times during the work day.</li>
            <li> Very pricey deodorant however since I am allergic to the aluminium in most deodorants decided to spend the cash and try this product.  Love the scent and I believe it will last a long time so in my case it is probably worth the investment however for a heavy deodorant user -  you may be better off with a lower cost aluminium free product.  I have not had any allergies using this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, more expensive than some deodorants but lasts a really long time and when I&#x27;m under pressure I don&#x27;t smell like a sweat hog.</li>
