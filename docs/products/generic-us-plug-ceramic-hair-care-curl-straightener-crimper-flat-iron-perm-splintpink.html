            <li>The size makes it really super convenient for on the go!</li>
            <li>But it was really cheap</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t really work because of the catching of hair.</li>
            <li>Well they get pretty hot which is good.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is perfect for short hair like mine and my daughters</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you have a small spot of hair to straighten, but not for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and facile, shows the incomparable and elaborate quality is on the side of the package.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m often in a hurry and can use one that heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick</li>
            <li>The plates get very hot and there is no heat control either.</li>
            <li>but it does get very hot</li>
            <li>I think its a pretty good deal for a low price</li>
            <li>Since my  hair is mostly straight anyway, its going to be just fine for me.</li>
            <li>because if its small size, item great for travel and will not take a lot of space.</li>
            <li>Its also not pink, more of a purple color.</li>
            <li>This straightener works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the hot plates do not touch when pressed together</li>
            <li>And Two, there&#x27;s nothing on it to tell you how hot it is.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with the item and would order again.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair it gets extremely hot maybe even hot enought to get a third degree burn ok not that hot</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work, I plugged it in and it got hot for about 15 minutes and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li>But overall it worked pretty good for only $5.</li>
            <li>okay, The plates only touch at the very end and</li>
            <li>but it heats up pretty fast, says 100 - 200 c on the package.</li>
            <li>: doesn&#x27;t straighten all the way, REALLY HOT, and when you are using it you are to keep your fingers at the VERY bottom</li>
            <li>works really good for a small straightener</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too smart when I selected this.  </li>
            <li>This is not the straighter for you if you are doing your whole head.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat/already straight hair</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>It works great for thin hair</li>
            <li>or else you will get burned easily, cord is not that long</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly, and although the plates are small they are perfect for bangs and shorter hair, and would work for longer, thicker hair in a pinch, although I don&#x27;t recommend it for very curly or very thick hair because of the amount of time it would take.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast definitely keep away from children because my daughter thinks its a toy and goes to grab it off my vanity every time I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Gets hot enough but doesn&#x27;t close tightly enough for fine hair.</li>
            <li>, if you like your hair extra straight like me then this product is for you!!</li>
            <li>I noticed that the plates didn&#x27;t align when I first opened it, but that didn&#x27;t phase me, no big deal.</li>
            <li>and it heats up just like my old full-sized straightener that just died!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>: small, cute color, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>had expected a full size object</li>
            <li>I think this can only straight up my babys hair</li>
            <li>and I do not blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>If you have medium or thick hair this would work fine..</li>
            <li>When they say its travel size, they mean it can fit in your jacket pocket.</li>
            <li>Super small.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m disappointed because what sold me on this item is the great reviews it had....</li>
            <li>the flat iron is much smaller than expected but does work on my fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li>It took me much longer than usual to straighten hair because it was smaller than normal size flat iron but worked.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> ; is about 4 inches long would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> About a quarter inch wide and 4-5 inches long.</li>
            <li> i ordered pink, NOT PURPLE</li>
            <li> then we expected it to be its travel sized</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glide like my other hair straighteners do.</li>
            <li> If the color is a factor the color choices include purple, pink, black and tan.</li>
            <li> I have to like sit on the ground and hunch down</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for,and while small and harder to work with on a lot of hair,this straightener does the job.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It has no instruction for use and no light to show it is on</li>
            <li> It is small, as it says in the description, but that&#x27;s what I wanted for travel and touch ups.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> The part about this product that sucks is when I tried straightening my hair</li>
            <li> but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with thick hair unless you want to stand there for weeks trying to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed when i got this because of two things, One, the cord is way way to short!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is broken, and it was made broken to begin with</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the product, but once used it I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another hair straightener again</li>
            <li> it felt like it was pulling my hair and was painful.</li>
            <li> It was broken and in terrible shape to be called an iron.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use. Works well.</li>
            <li> I think this can only straight up my babys hair 😕👎👶</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap. I noticed that the plates didn&#x27;t align when I first opened it, but that didn&#x27;t phase me, no big deal. Then I went to use it and the plug in barley fits correctly, it was kind of flimsy, but..no big deal. The part about this product that sucks is when I tried straightening my hair it felt like it was pulling my hair and was painful. It didn&#x27;t glide like my other hair straighteners do. So this product is a no go. But it was really cheap and I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping so I&#x27;ll just take it as a loss.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless your doing a barbies hair.</li>
            <li> Super small.  Not so great</li>
            <li> Well they get pretty hot which is good. They are teeny tiny though. About a quarter inch wide and 4-5 inches long. This is not the straighter for you if you are doing your whole head. I just do my bangs so it works. But I thought it would be larger, its not. When they say its travel size, they mean it can fit in your jacket pocket. This is perfect if you have a small spot of hair to straighten, but not for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> the flat iron is much smaller than expected but does work on my fairly straight hair. I used it to straighten my bangs and it did a good job on my bangs. because if its small size, item great for travel and will not take a lot of space. Great to take if you want to do touch up before going out or after working out at a gym. It does not take long to heat up. It took me much longer than usual to straighten hair because it was smaller than normal size flat iron but worked. Yes it does not have a button to turn on or off but I don&#x27;t mind unplugging item. I cannot comment on how well it works on curly hair. I have somewhat/already straight hair and I do not blow dry my hair straight. I rely on iron for touch ups so this iron works well on me.  I recommend for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Well, its definitly tiny. Its also not pink, more of a purple color. Heats up fast and is perfect for short hair like mine and my daughters</li>
            <li> It works okay, The plates only touch at the very end and the plastic surrounding them catch hair and tug. The plates get very hot and there is no heat control either. I bought it to fix my bangs in the morning but it won&#x27;t really work because of the catching of hair.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the product, but once used it I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another hair straightener again it also straightened my roots vey well and they don&#x27;t look like somebody scared me anymore, if you like your hair extra straight like me then this product is for you!!</li>
            <li> This straightener was way smaller than I expected or needed (my hair is waist length) but I tried it anyway and it heats up just like my old full-sized straightener that just died! Since my  hair is mostly straight anyway, its going to be just fine for me. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money I wasn&#x27;t too smart when I selected this.  look at the prongs closely and its not ul listed</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for,and while small and harder to work with on a lot of hair,this straightener does the job.</li>
            <li> Wonderful love it useful handy!!!! Practical  pretty color!!!</li>
            <li> This straightener works exactly as described. It is small, as it says in the description, but that&#x27;s what I wanted for travel and touch ups. It gets hot quickly, and although the plates are small they are perfect for bangs and shorter hair, and would work for longer, thicker hair in a pinch, although I don&#x27;t recommend it for very curly or very thick hair because of the amount of time it would take. I bought this to keep in my purse for touch ups and travel and it is perfect for that, a great value and very useful to have on the go!</li>
            <li> Had no protector to grab for your fingers.</li>
            <li> This product is just fair to me. It has no instruction for use and no light to show it is on or not.heat was an issue with me.</li>
            <li> Gets hot enough but doesn&#x27;t close tightly enough for fine hair. Fast shipping and good price. If you have medium or thick hair this would work fine..</li>
            <li> -it looks completely different than the picture and description&lt;br /&gt;- it is broken, and it was made broken to begin with, the mail didnt do this.&lt;br /&gt;- i ordered pink, NOT PURPLE&lt;br /&gt;- the hot plates do not touch when pressed together</li>
            <li> It is no longer than 6 inches and the plug will not stay in the wall. the cord is too short to work with. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed when i got this because of two things, One, the cord is way way to short!!!!! WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! like, what? Why would the cord be so short? I have to like sit on the ground and hunch down so i wasn&#x27;t happy about that at all. And Two, there&#x27;s nothing on it to tell you how hot it is. But overall it worked pretty good for only $5. But i don&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone and i&#x27;m disappointed because what sold me on this item is the great reviews it had.... I give this thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a no star it came out for like if it was for your eyelashes it&#x27;s so small and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small yes but it heats up pretty fast, says 100 - 200 c on the package. The size makes it really super convenient for on the go! It&#x27;s natural and facile, shows the incomparable and elaborate quality is on the side of the package. It got here ahead of schedule and I&#x27;m amazed the care that went into the packing. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs one at home or for traveling, I considered the reviews that say it&#x27;s too small or too hot but that is a plus because I&#x27;m often in a hurry and can use one that heats up quickly. Really a good item I can tuck it in my purse and take it anywhere. If the color is a factor the color choices include purple, pink, black and tan. Really nice, really good selection. Overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with the item and would order again. Get here in perfect condition, it&#x27;s great to have this to use.</li>
            <li> It was broken and in terrible shape to be called an iron. I bought this a while back months ago and I still don&#x27;t even use it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair it gets extremely hot maybe even hot enought to get a third degree burn ok not that hot but it does get very hot it might even burn your hair  This so called  &amp;#34;flatlining iron&amp;#34; is about 4 inches long would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast definitely keep away from children because my daughter thinks its a toy and goes to grab it off my vanity every time I&#x27;m using. It works great for thin hair but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with thick hair unless you want to stand there for weeks trying to straighten your hair. But very handy when traveling it fits in your purse so its good for touch ups as well.</li>
            <li> Got here And is great works as good as a large flat iron...I think its a pretty good deal for a low price</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It doesn&#x27;t work, I plugged it in and it got hot for about 15 minutes and hasn&#x27;t worked since. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> was smaller then we expected it to be its travel sized had expected a full size object but it does work well</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s great! It heats up super quick</li>
            <li> works really good for a small straightener</li>
            <li> Hmmm...I guess:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: small, cute color, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t straighten all the way, REALLY HOT, and when you are using it you are to keep your fingers at the VERY bottom or else you will get burned easily, cord is not that long</li>
