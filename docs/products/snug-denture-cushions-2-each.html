            <li>Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li>both say the Snugs are the best thing they&#x27;ve ever found, and wish they&#x27;d have discovered them years ago.</li>
            <li>I have been using snug denture pads for quite a while best thing I have found on the market great had to get in Australia</li>
            <li>I am very glad I ,thanx!</li>
            <li>This product is great for the lower dentures.</li>
            <li>Great thing to have around.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>it just floated in between... making me feel like my denture could fly out of my mouth at any time.</li>
            <li>Price is fair.  </li>
            <li>The order arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Still a good product in a pinch.</li>
            <li>We use it with the aid of a hair dryer warming snug &amp; denture to make perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>what nice idea</li>
            <li>The best product I have brought that keeps my dentures soft and stops my gums from getting sore.</li>
            <li>Snug has given my dentures more time before needing relining - a costly item.  </li>
            <li>the cost is sometimes more than we can afford at the time.  </li>
            <li>This product helps with that time and gives you the comfort to continue until you might better afford the denture repair.  </li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if I could figure out an easier and better way of trimming them.</li>
            <li>but they work better than all the goop in tubes you can buy.</li>
            <li>It makes lose fitting dentures fit better.</li>
            <li>This cushion is very comfortable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so your dentures fit better before trying this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good substitute for glue and lasts much longer,therefore saving money.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Snug is the best, for partial or full dentures.</li>
            <li>After you cut them to fit your dentures.</li>
            <li>You will have to cut to make the liners fit.  </li>
            <li>Just cut it to fit your dentures.  </li>
            <li>I cut these to fit my lower denture and followed the directions to the T ...</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!!!</li>
            <li>All you need to do is take them out of your mouth and clean them in lukewarm water with denture cleanser for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think I like this better than Ezo.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve still got all my teeth.</li>
            <li>This helps those socks fit right.</li>
            <li>Snug Denture Cushions help loose false teeth fit better, the cushion is soft so no blisters, easy to apply and won&#x27;t fall out, they conform to your mouth for a great fit, Smile, laugh and eat anything, they are the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick to arrive.</li>
            <li>Received all 6 boxes and love the natural fit.</li>
            <li>I coundnt find EZOS  cushions, however his product is far better at making my dentures fit.  </li>
            <li>I sent them an assortment of powders, reliners, cushions and whatnot, and the very first thing they tried was these, Snug denture cushions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No irritation to the gums and no unpleasant taste or ooze.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with no messy glue in your mouth and holds dentures secure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, they threw out the packaging for that box of denture products, because once they tried the Snugs they&#x27;re done looking, but can&#x27;t return over a hundred bucks worth of stuff</li>
            <li>If you take the time it works out ok but have found other prodocts that work better.</li>
            <li>If you work it right 1 square will make 2 lower liners.   </li>
            <li>Price was right for 6 boxes I guess.  </li>
            <li>they are soft and after getting them cut to the right size it was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>They are the right product - but 1 box was not enough and it sounds like 6 boxes was too many.  </li>
            <li>yes I did this rating I recommend it to anyone who has problems with their dentures,also I like snug very much</li>
            <li>It  will be cheaper , since  these cost so much!</li>
            <li>Snugs will last  longer and feel better.</li>
            <li>the snug cushions are exactly what I wanted  </li>
            <li>Each liner will last for a month or so but you must keep them and your mouth very clean to get this amount of use.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Thanks  Betty</li>
            <li>These Snug Denture Cushions don&#x27;t provide as much cushion as I need.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help with loose dentures; most are sticky or messy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed high acid foods and alcohol seem to soften the Snugs a bit.  </li>
            <li>Your dentures must be sparkling clean and bone dry.</li>
            <li>You may need to trim a bit more after wearing for a few hours.</li>
            <li>However, on the back edge it has to be trimmed right on the edge</li>
            <li>The first problem is you only get two in a box.  </li>
            <li>I just put one in my lower denture for the first time, and I left the overlap as directed.</li>
            <li>Snag it soft and pliable and fills in all the gabs.</li>
            <li>My lower dentures feel much better with snug, you can keep snug attached to your lower dentures for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I needed them for my lower dentures, but after a short time they loosened up i have to put paste on top to get them to stay for yet another few hours.</li>
            <li>Snugs stick to their dentures like glue, and also stick to their gums just dandy (something the Ezo&#x27;s didn&#x27;t, apparently).</li>
            <li>These are not meant to be a permanent solution for poor fitting dentures, but can help you get along until you can get to the dentist.</li>
            <li>It never got soft enough to form to my upper plate.</li>
            <li>It worked ok but a little hard to cut and apply to bottom denture.</li>

            <li> solved my ill fitting denture problems-was either this or a new set-too bad they arnt sold in canadian pharmacies any more</li>
            <li> Should be used only long enough to see your dentist for denture adjustment.</li>
            <li> Product is Much thinner than when I ordered it in the past.</li>
            <li> and it feels like it might be coming loose in the back.</li>
            <li> It does not actually stick to dentures as advertized, even though I used a hair dryer to dry my dentures it still was loose.  </li>
            <li> Even though I know you should pay to have them relined when they become loose</li>
            <li> and it was like pushing a piece of loose, rough felt in between me and my dentures.</li>
            <li> When you apply the liner follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be embarrassed anymore by slipping dentures, get some snug dental cushions.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I really expected.</li>
            <li> Product not available locally here at home.</li>
            <li> I tried other products for loose dentures.</li>
            <li> They can be a little tricky to get in place</li>
            <li> Also, after just a few hours in my mouth I was having to pull them out and take out the debri foods around the edges.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the current quality.</li>
            <li> It did not secure to my mouth or to the denture...</li>
            <li> I hated them all, some were sticky, others very messy, most just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> My mother said she&#x27;s always had the problem of having to readjust her lowers after every few bites of food, but no more, because the Snugs stay in place</li>
            <li> Once you start chewing the snug squeezes out the back of your denture into your throat making it difficult to swallow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ezo Denture Cushions in the past and they are unavailable everywhere</li>
            <li> I would recomend Snug to anyone who suffers from loose dentures,  I have used it for years after trying other brands</li>
            <li> Too hard to use&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> This item is poorly advertized.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product to my knowledge.</li>
            <li> Just the thing for dentures that are slightly uncomfortable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of years. I love them! I tried other products for loose dentures. I hated them all, some were sticky, others very messy, most just didn&#x27;t do the job. Snug has given my dentures more time before needing relining - a costly item.  TIPS: Each liner will last for a month or so but you must keep them and your mouth very clean to get this amount of use. Removing your dentures at night will extend the life of the liners. When you apply the liner follow directions carefully. Your dentures must be sparkling clean and bone dry. You may need to trim a bit more after wearing for a few hours. This will vary from person to person. I&#x27;ve noticed high acid foods and alcohol seem to soften the Snugs a bit.  These are not meant to be a permanent solution for poor fitting dentures, but can help you get along until you can get to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my elderly mom.  She uses it and likes it alot.  Price is fair.  Shipment was quick to arrive.</li>
            <li> Snug Denture Cushions help loose false teeth fit better, the cushion is soft so no blisters, easy to apply and won&#x27;t fall out, they conform to your mouth for a great fit, Smile, laugh and eat anything, they are the best on the market. Don&#x27;t be embarrassed anymore by slipping dentures, get some snug dental cushions.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the lower dentures. It makes lose fitting dentures fit better. If you work it right 1 square will make 2 lower liners.   Snag it soft and pliable and fills in all the gabs. Great thing to have around.  My dentist said that lower dentures are like putting socks on a rooster. This helps those socks fit right.</li>
            <li> purchased snugs for my father-in-law at his request.  The order arrived on time and in good condition.  My father-in-law is very happy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The best product I have brought that keeps my dentures soft and stops my gums from getting sore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these personally, but we bought them for an elderly relative.  They are the right product - but 1 box was not enough and it sounds like 6 boxes was too many.  What can you do?  Price was right for 6 boxes I guess.  Nothing wrong with the product to my knowledge.</li>
            <li> yes I did this rating I recommend it to anyone who has problems with their dentures,also I like snug very much</li>
            <li> This item is poorly advertized.  I was looking for something I could change daily, not otherwise.  It does not actually stick to dentures as advertized, even though I used a hair dryer to dry my dentures it still was loose.  Also, after just a few hours in my mouth I was having to pull them out and take out the debri foods around the edges.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product is Much thinner than when I ordered it in the past. I Need to use 2 cushions for comfort. Not happy with the current quality.</li>
            <li> not what I thought they would be</li>
            <li> great product. I buy these for my 95 yo mother. This is the only ones she can use.</li>
            <li> My lower dentures feel much better with snug, you can keep snug attached to your lower dentures for at least 2 weeks. All you need to do is take them out of your mouth and clean them in lukewarm water with denture cleanser for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend snug for anyone with lower dentures, your mouth will feel fresher with snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre Thirkill&lt;br /&gt;Dugway Utah</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I would have hoped. Still a good product in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Received all 6 boxes and love the natural fit.</li>
            <li> Since i couldnt find ezocushions any where  in the world, believe me i have looked.  I tried these out of desperation. The first problem is you only get two in a box.  After you cut them to fit your dentures. Once you start chewing the snug squeezes out the back of your denture into your throat making it difficult to swallow.  Even though i take them out and keep trimming it.  I dont like  these but they will have to do till i get my dentures relined. It  will be cheaper , since  these cost so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using snug denture pads for quite a while best thing I have found on the market great had to get in Australia</li>
            <li> Used them before, couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else. A friend recommended I look on your site.I am very glad I ,thanx!</li>
            <li> I coundnt find EZOS  cushions, however his product is far better at making my dentures fit.  You will have to cut to make the liners fit.  Snugs will last  longer and feel better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay in place in the denture no matter what nice idea but it does not hold at all</li>
            <li> They are not the same quality as before. They start to split and tear apart. They cause sore spots on my gums.</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable and smooth.  No irritation to the gums and no unpleasant taste or ooze.  An added benefit is that they can last for days.  Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> Snug is the best, for partial or full dentures. We use it with the aid of a hair dryer warming snug &amp; denture to make perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help with loose dentures; most are sticky or messy.  Even though I know you should pay to have them relined when they become loose the cost is sometimes more than we can afford at the time.  This product helps with that time and gives you the comfort to continue until you might better afford the denture repair.  The biggest problem that I have had is finding this product.</li>
            <li> the snug cushions are exactly what I wanted  Thanks  Betty</li>
            <li> Sometimes my dentures irritate my gum&#x27;s. they are soft and after getting them cut to the right size it was easy to work with. Just cut it to fit your dentures.  I needed them for my lower dentures, but after a short time they loosened up i have to put paste on top to get them to stay for yet another few hours.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but a little hard to cut and apply to bottom denture. If you take the time it works out ok but have found other prodocts that work better.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I really expected. It never got soft enough to form to my upper plate. I did  not usse them</li>
            <li> I choose this when i could not get Ezo. I really think I like this better than Ezo. Yes I would tell someone else about this product.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if I could figure out an easier and better way of trimming them. I just put one in my lower denture for the first time, and I left the overlap as directed. However, on the back edge it has to be trimmed right on the edge and it feels like it might be coming loose in the back. If anyone has any hints they&#x27;ve discovered through use, please advise.</li>
            <li> Just the thing for dentures that are slightly uncomfortable.  I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!!! Too hard to use&lt;br /&gt;Did not stay in place&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again&lt;br /&gt;I would not give a star At all</li>
            <li> No good...fell apart in one day of usage.</li>
            <li> solved my ill fitting denture problems-was either this or a new set-too bad they arnt sold in canadian pharmacies any more</li>
            <li> My Aunt discovered these years ago when they used to sell them at Drug Emporium.  Now I buy them for family members because they work like they&#x27;re supposed to.  They can be a little tricky to get in place but they work better than all the goop in tubes you can buy.</li>
            <li> Product not available locally here at home. It is a good substitute for glue and lasts much longer,therefore saving money. Easy to use with no messy glue in your mouth and holds dentures secure. Should be used only long enough to see your dentist for denture adjustment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ezo Denture Cushions in the past and they are unavailable everywhere I&#x27;ve looked. These Snug Denture Cushions don&#x27;t provide as much cushion as I need.</li>
            <li> I cut these to fit my lower denture and followed the directions to the T ... and it was like pushing a piece of loose, rough felt in between me and my dentures. It did not secure to my mouth or to the denture... it just floated in between... making me feel like my denture could fly out of my mouth at any time. Save your money...get a reliner so your dentures fit better before trying this product. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve still got all my teeth. However, my 84-year-old mother and 82-year-old father have been using EZO cushions since the 1960&#x27;s, so when they couldn&#x27;t find them they asked my help in locating a replacement. I sent them an assortment of powders, reliners, cushions and whatnot, and the very first thing they tried was these, Snug denture cushions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they threw out the packaging for that box of denture products, because once they tried the Snugs they&#x27;re done looking, but can&#x27;t return over a hundred bucks worth of stuff so I can get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, they will never need to change products again. Not even Ezo will take the place of the Snugs (which is why I&#x27;m writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both say the Snugs are the best thing they&#x27;ve ever found, and wish they&#x27;d have discovered them years ago. Snugs stick to their dentures like glue, and also stick to their gums just dandy (something the Ezo&#x27;s didn&#x27;t, apparently). My mother said she&#x27;s always had the problem of having to readjust her lowers after every few bites of food, but no more, because the Snugs stay in place so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, they both claim the Snugs last for weeks before they need changed. I hope this review helps people decide to try them, judging by how ecstatic my folks are about them.</li>
            <li> I would recomend Snug to anyone who suffers from loose dentures,  I have used it for years after trying other brands I always go back to Snug !!  PMK</li>
