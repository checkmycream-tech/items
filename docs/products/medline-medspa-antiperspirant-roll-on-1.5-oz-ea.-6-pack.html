            <li> This is the best!  My husband and daughter have extreme problems with sweating and this product stops it. It is the only thing we have ever found that really works. I highly recommend this for anyone with a perspirant problem!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and buys some every year since it&#x27;s near impossible to find anywhere but on Amazon.  However, this year she bought 2 six packs and noticed that when the product arrived all the bottles had the same 9/14 expiration date as the product she bought last year.  I&#x27;ve written to the Amazon Marketplace provider who has not yet responded to my inquiry.  If the date on the product was fresher, we would rate the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a gal pal of mine and I love it!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this deodorant from the hospital after surgery. It lasted almost eight weeks. Incredible.Finding this product at this price is a rare find.</li>
            <li> Great product for those that cannot use alcohol.</li>
            <li> I was also given this product in the hospital, after knee-replacement surgeries, (2) and found it to be simply wonderful! While recovering, and going through physical therapy 3 times a day, it kept me smelling and feeling fresh! I too, will order this product as long as it is available. It surpasses anything I have ever used and loved. :)</li>
            <li> Simply put it does the job.</li>
            <li> better than what you buy in the store</li>
            <li> I happened on this product after a hospital visit.  It works really well and causes no rash as some of the brand name  antiperspirants can do. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I had a rash from most deodorants and it cleared up once I began using MedSpa. Just bought a pack of 6 since it&#x27;s not available in pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Works for me - best antiperspirant on the market!</li>

            <li> I became aware of this product after a surgery.  It was part of the &amp;#34;gift bag&amp;#34; you get when you spend the night!  It works really well.  It has a slight cinnamon scent, in my opinion.  When I did a search for the name brand I found this excellent deal.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital in the Spring and was given MedSpa Anti-perspirant to use. I normally don&#x27;t use antiperspirant, rather deodorant.  I found this product to be very effective with a nice light fragrance. Because of it&#x27;s effectiveness, I decided to see if I could buy it on-line, which I could. I am certain I will continue using this product for as long as It is available.</li>
            <li> she swears this deodorant is the only kind that will not break her out and this was such a good price</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while in the hospital after shoulder replacement surgery.  I am allergic to most deodorants but this one caused NO irritation and got the job done.  The ease of application made it even better for me with an immobilized shoulder.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free and does not glob on, very gentle on my skin, keeps me dry and I gave my mom some to try in the Las Vegas heat of 110 degrees and she was very happy she wasn&#x27;t soaked with sweat, I will order more.</li>
            <li> Great product. This was a reorder.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping very good produkt very happy</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  Will continue to buy it.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  I&#x27;ve tried many other deodarants and antiperspirants and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> this product stops the wetness with no overpowering scent or residue.  just a little application and i don&#x27;t apply again for a couple of days.  i bought 6 of these.... that will probably last me the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> We use this at our hospital and it is the only deodorant my wife has found that does not cause a rash.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant fragrance, dries fast and does not leave white marks on dark clothes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available aluminum free though.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant! I live in Arizona and sweat just walking outside. This deoderant is amazing and what a great price. My teenagers have now taken over the extra ones I have.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I found it when I was in the hospital and liked it so much I bought my own when I got out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now and it still works great. My grandmother told me about it after my grandfather stayed in a hospital. Non-irritating and last all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant in the world.  I just ordered 12 of them.  Living in Florida and this keeps me dry and there is no scent in the product in 100 degree and humidity weather.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, have been using for a couple of years, keeps me dry and odor free!</li>
            <li> I like this product and ordered again . I fill very comfortable  with  Medline MedSpa Antiperspirant. No more rush and etching under arm!</li>
            <li> Great product with a nice clean scent.  It&#x27;s clear and dries fast.  Leaves no marks or stains on clothes.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;Had developed a sensitivity to many other products.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation from this roll-on!</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me when I was in the hospital back in January and I loved it. So since then I been using it and I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon. Thanks</li>

            <li> Excellent product and meets or exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while in the hospital, and was leery of trying it because I hate the long dry time of roll-on antiperspirants and have extremely sensitive skin. For years I have struggled with very heavy perspiration. I have tried every &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; brand on the market. While several of them work, every time there is a slight fragrance or formula change I end up with terrible itching and rash. I have no such problems with MedSpa and it also works better than any commercial brand!</li>
