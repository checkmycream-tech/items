            <li> I have very oily skin which is prone to breakouts especially in the summer with sweating, and sitting in the sun which I do often as possible. I have been using Murad face washes for about 6 months now and literally have had no breakouts. I figured I might as well try their sunscreen since their products prevent me from breaking out. The sunscreen works great, spreads easy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and left my skin sunburn and breakout free! I recommend!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for my skin..</li>
            <li> This is not oil free, it is too thick, it smells bad, and it does not protect you from the sun. you ll get red and burn using it. So if you are locking for a matte finish sunblock this is not for you! what a waste of money! it works for nothing</li>
            <li> The oil free sunscreen provides me long lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> This has been in years my favorite sunscreen , it has a been the only one that works really well on my skin. I am happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> overpriced by this reseller</li>
            <li> This is a daily must for all ladies who wants to prevent early signs of aging from sun damage.  ------Edited Nov 07, 2010--------------  I stopped using this product when EWG.org released information that Oxybenzone is now considered a toxic chemical (hormone disruptor.)In this particular product, 5% make up the ingredient.  Buyers beware.</li>
            <li> This was a great product to have throughout the summer.  I used this on my face, shoulders, neck and chest throughout the summer.  It goes on wonderfully, not oily or smelly, and I never felt like it would cause break-outs.  I also like the mattifying spf 15 version, which I will use more throughout the fall/winter just on my face.  I recommend this spf 30 for fuller sun protection though.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with spf. I didn&#x27;t break me out and it worked great under my makeup. I have combination skin with occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> Good Protection against sunlight.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product. Its not greasy and smelly like other products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This a great product.  My husband uses it daily on his face.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Great sunscreen for the face!</li>
            <li> This is excellent if you have oily skin and tend to break out. I use it every day, even in winter. It&#x27;s non-oily but at the same time it&#x27;s quite a good moisturizer. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it claims to be oil-free.  In comparison to others it does not feel as greasy or thick as some sunblocks.  I would like for it to be a little more matte finish, but not sure if there is truly such a thing when it comes to sunblocks.  Over all I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for those with sensitive skin or suffer from skin disorders like Eczema. its the only Sunscreen I use. its on the pricey side and you have to re-apply often but it works well. It has has a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> Great, new and improve.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer+sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;It has a really, really nice smell of pomegranate and not that disgusting smell most sunscreens have.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the Winter (Summer, too!) and it works fine without any moisturizer on top of it, it moisturizes my skin really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I have a combination oily skin and when u first put this on, it feels a little oily (just very very little!).&lt;br /&gt;But then after 15mins or so, it is fully absorbed and it gives you a semi-matte, dewy and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING..</li>
            <li> Just perfect for oil skin... This is oil free.. smells so good and I&#x27;m using after I did a peeling.</li>
            <li> Really a great everyday sunblock</li>
            <li> I use this lotion religiously.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I wish it were a bit more matte.</li>
            <li> I like Murad products.  This is a nice sunscreen, but still leaves my face shiny, given it is oil free, there is not a matt effect....</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great! It isn&#x27;t as matte as it claims, but you don&#x27;t have that heavy sunscreen feeling on your face all day. I use this around town not for a long day at the beach or on the water. Smells great and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve encountered in my search. It quickly absorbs into your skin and leaves you feeling properly covered, which is the goal. Enjoy.</li>
