            <li>Its a pretty good size bottle as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but the bottle goes quickly if you use it after tanning sessions  </li>
            <li>Early delivery and great product.</li>
            <li>This product smells so good, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this lotion, works so good after being in actual sun or Tanning bed!</li>
            <li>smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft, also keeps my tan looking fresh!</li>
            <li>It seemed a little runny, but the smell was awesome!</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from another site, but I thought I would share my thoughts on this product on here.  </li>
            <li>Light moisturizer that&#x27;s helped extend my tan.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel so smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $17 but nothing more</li>
            <li>I trust buying the cheap lotions on here but</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing extender!</li>
            <li>I would not have purchased this product if I would have been able to smell it first.</li>
            <li>really helps extend your tan, smells great, and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of lotion to keep your skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>I would definetly recommend this product due to the excellent lotion and the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite extender.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and that&#x27;s why I use it daily, not just after tanning.</li>
            <li>then the salons and way worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for the scent, but not for the moisture</li>
            <li>and I checked if it was authentic with my old tanning salon</li>
            <li>I love the way Kardashian Glow smells and it makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tan extenders and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an intense tanning lotion smell that I&#x27;ve experienced with other extenders.</li>
            <li>I always use this lotion right after I get out of the tanning bed or right after a shower.</li>
            <li>It really helps extend your tan which is nice especially for people like me who spend all day in an office.  </li>
            <li>The velvety texture is definitely a must have for easy and quick application.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely hooked!  </li>
            <li>This product would be ok if only the pump worked on it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy, and I really feel like it extends the life of my tan!</li>
            <li>It has such a potent fragrance that it rubs off on all of your clothes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell of this product, it definitely has a perfume smell to it, not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>so my standards are pretty high!</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin like I do, then you need more than this lotion to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel super soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>It is MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast, I ordered it on a Tuesday night and got it by Friday noon.  </li>
            <li>i was really hoping this product smelled like the intensifier Kardashian tanning bed lotion</li>
            <li>Put to much on my hands and it started to peal.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>I expected to like this lotion more based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light/smooth texture and smell.</li>
            <li>and it got here fast.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very lightweight but also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was told that the product was either out of date or not the product I really ordered.</li>
            <li>And it goes on really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cloying floral smell and felt very greasy.</li>
            <li>To me personally, it smells like something a more mature woman would wear.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really does prolong the live of my tan.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who tans.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I put too much of it on the first time and had a lot of extra product where I had applied it.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t burn on vacation like I normally do.</li>
            <li>It did however seem to make my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I used this for one week and was amazed how bronzed and soft my skin was!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not like an old lady floral scent or anything.</li>
            <li>it is the real thing i double checked with my salon wahoo!!</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li>BUT it doesnt, it smells average but not bad which is a plus</li>
            <li>People have a tendency of mixing regular generic lotions into these products and selling them at a price that people think is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did once unwrapped is compare the smell to the one I smelled previously at my tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day long and so does the amazingly soft feeling your skin has from using it.  </li>

            <li> The delivery was fast, I ordered it on a Tuesday night and got it by Friday noon.  </li>
            <li> i was really hoping this product smelled like the intensifier Kardashian tanning bed lotion</li>
            <li> Put to much on my hands and it started to peal.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I expected to like this lotion more based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light/smooth texture and smell.</li>
            <li> and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very lightweight but also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was told that the product was either out of date or not the product I really ordered.</li>
            <li> And it goes on really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cloying floral smell and felt very greasy.</li>
            <li> To me personally, it smells like something a more mature woman would wear.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really does prolong the live of my tan.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who tans.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I put too much of it on the first time and had a lot of extra product where I had applied it.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t burn on vacation like I normally do.</li>
            <li> It did however seem to make my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I used this for one week and was amazed how bronzed and soft my skin was!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like an old lady floral scent or anything.</li>
            <li> it is the real thing i double checked with my salon wahoo!!</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> BUT it doesnt, it smells average but not bad which is a plus</li>
            <li> People have a tendency of mixing regular generic lotions into these products and selling them at a price that people think is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did once unwrapped is compare the smell to the one I smelled previously at my tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day long and so does the amazingly soft feeling your skin has from using it.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Smells good,thick enough to use as everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Was not authentic returned smelt like drug store generic lotion.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected, but the way it leaves your skin so silky makes up for the lost moisture!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Seems to Help hold my tan a little longer.</li>
            <li> (a few days a week)</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it smells bad at all like one reviewer said on here, but everyone has different scent preferences.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion I broke out with extremely weird sores on me.</li>
            <li> Not pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how horrible this stuff smells.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried this before and it is a great lotion!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion....really helps extend your tan, smells great, and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of lotion to keep your skin soft all day. I definitely will continue to purchase this lotion (I have 2 bottles now, 1 in my car to use at the tanning bed &amp; 1 in my house to use after showering). Great product &amp; would recommend anyone trying it! You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion u will never buy anything else</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from another site, but I thought I would share my thoughts on this product on here.  I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell of this product, it definitely has a perfume smell to it, not my favorite scent.  To me personally, it smells like something a more mature woman would wear.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.  I put too much of it on the first time and had a lot of extra product where I had applied it.  It did however seem to make my skin very soft.  I do not think I would purchase this product though because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this lotion before and love it.  It is MUCH cheaper then the salons and way worth the wait.  The delivery was fast, I ordered it on a Tuesday night and got it by Friday noon.  I would definetly recommend this product due to the excellent lotion and the fast delivery.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I used this for one week and was amazed how bronzed and soft my skin was! It smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin like I do, then you need more than this lotion to keep your skin hydrated. The smell is nice but the bottle goes quickly if you use it after tanning sessions  (a few days a week) like I do. I recommend Cypher 3 tan extender. It smells nice and keeps my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and applies nicely, but doesn&#x27;t hold the moisture in your skin. Worth it for the scent, but not for the moisture</li>
            <li> Was not authentic returned smelt like drug store generic lotion.</li>
            <li> i was really hoping this product smelled like the intensifier Kardashian tanning bed lotion BUT it doesnt, it smells average but not bad which is a plus.... it is also thicker as well, will probably use tghis in the winter time :)</li>
            <li> This product smells so good, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite extender. Smells kind of like flowers but it&#x27;s not like an old lady floral scent or anything. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or tacky after application.</li>
            <li> Love the smell defitaly not made for your hands as a lotion. Put to much on my hands and it started to peal. I still love it though.</li>
            <li> Smells great. It&#x27;s not greasy like regular lotions can be. It does extend the life of my tan.</li>
            <li> Kardashian Glow is absolutely AMAZING! And It smells so wonderful! I could literally sit and smell it for hours...lol If you&#x27;d like to extend your tan I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> Has no smell. Smells like any drugstore lotion. Not worth the money. Expired 2/15. I received may 2015.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and so smooth!</li>
            <li> Smells good! Gives you a longer tan</li>
            <li> I do like this lotion. I dont love it, but it is good. It seemed a little runny, but the smell was awesome!</li>
            <li> I expected to like this lotion more based on the reviews I read.  I would not have purchased this product if I would have been able to smell it first.</li>
            <li> Saved lots of money on Amazon vs the tanning salon. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This lotion really does prolong the live of my tan. It has a very light/smooth texture and smell. I always use this lotion right after I get out of the tanning bed or right after a shower. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it, smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel super soft and has a great scent!</li>
            <li> Good extender &amp; smell.  Still need back up lotion for dryness. Seems to Help hold my tan a little longer.</li>
            <li> love it  i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my daughter. She likes it but says it does not moisturize as well as some of the others she has used. However, it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It really helps extend your tan which is nice especially for people like me who spend all day in an office.  Smells amazing and I checked if it was authentic with my old tanning salon and it is. Great price and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the same stuff that is sold in the tanning salon but way cheaper. It smells great and many people ask me what I am wearing. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way Kardashian Glow smells and it makes your skin really soft. Highly recommend to anyone who tans.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but when I received it the cap was broke and it would not pump. Will probably not order it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this from my tanning salon on sale for around $30, and when I ran out I wanted to find it cheaper. I love the smell and I use it every day, even if I don&#x27;t go tanning. It works great as a tan extender and I used it after every tan before a trip to Puerto Rico. My tan lasted weeks and I didn&#x27;t burn on vacation like I normally do. The smell is amazing and that&#x27;s why I use it daily, not just after tanning. Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion - smells good - extends tan</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer that&#x27;s helped extend my tan. Nice light scent. Overall pleased with the product.  I have very dry skin so I use this product a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft, also keeps my tan looking fresh! Price was awesome as well.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected, but the way it leaves your skin so silky makes up for the lost moisture! Smell is just enough. It literally looks and feels like silk coming out of a bottle. Not greasy at all! I work at a tanning salon &amp; Kardashian products are the only products that have &amp;#34;lux-silicon&amp;#34; in them (makes you look airbrushed) LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> This smells great &amp; makes your skin feel like silk!! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tan extenders and this is by far my favorite, it&#x27;s very lightweight but also very moisturizing. This product also shipped very quickly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! (:</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. It made my skin feel super soft and mosturized. Deff recommend buying this product. I know i will.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot because it smells nice and does help extend your tan.  however, i&#x27;m not a fan of the sparkles in it and wish I had known about that prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> Best tan extender I&#x27;ve ever used! Smells good,thick enough to use as everyday lotion. Would recommend :)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! I&#x27;m addicted!! Its silky smooth and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this lotion, works so good after being in actual sun or Tanning bed!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it smells great and makes my skin so soft! it is the real thing i double checked with my salon wahoo!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely hooked!  I bought this from my salon and it smells great, I don&#x27;t think it smells bad at all like one reviewer said on here, but everyone has different scent preferences. The scent lasts all day long and so does the amazingly soft feeling your skin has from using it.  Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love the kardashian after glow.  This product also duels in my favor to help tan. I can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li> After using this lotion I broke out with extremely weird sores on me. I was told that the product was either out of date or not the product I really ordered. Not pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent and it makes my skin feel so smooth, not greasy. Love all of the Kardashian tanning line.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and we sell these for $45, but I got it for $17 here. It smells amazing and I love it. It&#x27;s worth the $17 but nothing more</li>
            <li> I got this at my salon and it is awesome! Tan extenders are very important for keeping a good tan and this is one of my favs!! Love the scent , smells like DKNY be delicious perfume I love it ! Its a pretty good size bottle as well. I don&#x27;t know of I trust buying the cheap lotions on here but out of my salon I love it!!</li>
            <li> This product would be ok if only the pump worked on it.  Love the smell but it&#x27;s aggravating having to take the lid off everytime I want to use it and squeezing it just enough without all of it squirting out all over me.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product all around. Very hydrating and smells amazing!! This and Expose is probably the best tan extender I&#x27;ve ever used. I work at a tanning salon so my standards are pretty high!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells amazing!! And it goes on really well, I use it every day after I shower and before bed</li>
            <li> One of my favorite tan extenders!! Awesome scent and enhances my tan I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This lotion has a great floral scent that is not too overpowering.  Leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy, and I really feel like it extends the life of my tan!</li>
            <li> A bit over priced, but the product works good as a moisterizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how horrible this stuff smells. I was bullied into buying it from the girl at the salon because it was on sale. I was able to tolerate the scent and feel of the lotion for all of five minute before I had to shower. It&#x27;s a cloying floral smell and felt very greasy. Go with something else!!!</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing extender! It smells so good and works so well! It has dramatically helped my tan. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It is simply wonderful! I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel amazing after tanning and showering. Definitely is a must have for indoor and outdoor tanning. It makes me skin feel softer and firmer. I also love the smell. It isn&#x27;t an intense tanning lotion smell that I&#x27;ve experienced with other extenders. The velvety texture is definitely a must have for easy and quick application.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this after tanning lotion.  My husband uses it as well. Great scent.  Not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> This lotion last until you shower it off.  It works great, feels great, smells awesome and keeps your tan a lot longer.  A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail.  The first thing I did once unwrapped is compare the smell to the one I smelled previously at my tanning salon.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as potent as the one my salon is selling.  It almost smells as if regular lotion may be mixed in.  I will be going to my salon today to compare smells again, and if this product doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as the one at my salon, then be expecting a 1 star review and a warning not to buy this product on Amazon.  People have a tendency of mixing regular generic lotions into these products and selling them at a price that people think is reasonable. I will give it 3 stars for now, because I have not yet used this product.  To be continued..</li>
            <li> Love it..if you tan you should buy this product</li>
            <li> Early delivery and great product. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a great after-tan moisturizer. My only comment is that your skin feels somewhat sticky after using it. It has such a potent fragrance that it rubs off on all of your clothes.</li>
