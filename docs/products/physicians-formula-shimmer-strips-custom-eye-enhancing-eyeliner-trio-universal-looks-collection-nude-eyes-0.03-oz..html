            <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>These colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>it glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and does not rub off throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more colors in this line and repurchasing these.</li>
            <li>LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Will buy again love these shimmer strips.</li>
            <li>I love all three colors but the bronze is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors, the smooth application, and ease of use!</li>
            <li>I love the colors and their pigmentation and staying power can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap looking packaging.</li>
            <li>For me, it is a wonderful waterlining pencil - it helps brighten my eyes in a much more natural way than a white pencil.</li>
            <li>That being said, the color is fantastic and it stayed all day.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and beautiful and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>My skin in the waterline/tightline area is very sensitive, but I have found that if I warm up the tip for a minute by running it over my hand I can use them easily and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking I find Healthy Origins to make a fine product!</li>
            <li>I have only used one of the colors thus far, but the delivery speed was impeccable!</li>
            <li>I love the different shades and how smooth they are.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this product is not what is shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>This is the first truly waterproof eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t cake that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give these five stars is of no fault to the product, just more shimmery than I had wanted.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought them figuring I would mainly use the black and champagne colors, and yet the pewter ended up being my fav! .</li>
            <li>Easy to put on with minimal tugging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love the little sharpener built into the end.</li>
            <li>These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>I thought the Pewter color would&#x27;ve too light for my dark brown eyes</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>they last whole day....</li>
            <li>The lightest color I can barely see when I wear it</li>
            <li>I noticed that a lot of the other reviews mention that the champagne color doesn&#x27;t really show up.</li>
            <li>They take well to smudging for soft looks, but they set well and last a long time - even after sitting at the pool for three hours</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am allergic to a lot of make up but this product works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or my eye lids.  I like having an assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW. I always thought the Physician&#x27;s Formula would be garbage because of it&#x27;s cheap looking packaging. Boy am I kicking myself now. These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned! My Mac and Urban Decay pencils don&#x27;t hold a candle to these. I can put them on the back of my hand and wipe them a few seconds later, and they stay put! I am super impressed. Wore these for 12-hours and they looked THE SAME as when I put them on. Didn&#x27;t even use a primer. There&#x27;s a little sharpener on the bottom of the pencils that you would never know was there unless you read the packaging. Will be buying more colors in this line and repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the same as the item I already purchased at Harmon store. I didn&#x27;t like the colors at all. The had a shimmer to them</li>
            <li> Does NOT cause allergic reaction, yayy!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this product is not what is shown in the picture.  The product is actually eye shadow and not eye liner.</li>
            <li> LOVE this eyeliner. I thought the Pewter color would&#x27;ve too light for my dark brown eyes but it&#x27;s perfect.  This is the first truly waterproof eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t cake that I&#x27;ve tried. I even use it in Taekwondo class where I sweat a lot and it does not smear.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> These colors are nice.  Dark ones easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product to achieve smokey nude eyes.</li>
            <li> The lightest color I can barely see when I wear it -other two are great!</li>
            <li> I have only used one of the colors thus far, but the delivery speed was impeccable! It was ordered on the sunday and delivered by monday (within the same state)</li>
            <li> Will buy again love these shimmer strips.</li>
            <li> love these eyeliners!!! they last whole day.... dont come off or smudge through out the day!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> FABULOUS LINERS!!!!! I am in my 40&#x27;s and I have a lot of allergies and eye sensitivity. These liners are AMAZING!!!!!! Easy to put on with minimal tugging. They really bring out my green eyes. I honestly bought them figuring I would mainly use the black and champagne colors, and yet the pewter ended up being my fav! . I noticed that a lot of the other reviews mention that the champagne color doesn&#x27;t really show up. For me, it is a wonderful waterlining pencil - it helps brighten my eyes in a much more natural way than a white pencil. My skin in the waterline/tightline area is very sensitive, but I have found that if I warm up the tip for a minute by running it over my hand I can use them easily and painlessly. They take well to smudging for soft looks, but they set well and last a long time - even after sitting at the pool for three hours it looks like I just applied them! Will definitely buy again. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> I love the different shades and how smooth they are. They aren&#x27;t chalky, and don&#x27;t break. It&#x27;s a great quality product. They last me about 5 hours once I put some on.</li>
            <li> I love the little sharpener built into the end. Good value and it glides on nicely.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very beautiful.  It glides on smoothly, no tugging.  The color is rich and beautiful and lasts all day long.  I love all three colors but the bronze is my favorite.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have hazel eyes and this eye liner looks great and I love it.  Very smooth and does not rub off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> These eyeliner pencils are very sharp and apply a very thin line.  I would like a softer line and a softer pencil.</li>
            <li> A little...crumbly? Not sure how to put it, but it has a strange texture. That being said, the color is fantastic and it stayed all day. For the price? You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner! Love the colors, the smooth application, and ease of use! I have ordered again and again!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give these five stars is of no fault to the product, just more shimmery than I had wanted. They go on smooth and last for a long time. I would probably buy them again. I would wear a primer on your eyelid if you have oily eyelids as I do because they tend to migrate a tad during the day to my upper lid.</li>
            <li> I like it. Generally speaking I find Healthy Origins to make a fine product!</li>
            <li> Great quality. I was actually surprised since I&#x27;ve bought really expensive eyeliners before. I love the colors and their pigmentation and staying power can&#x27;t be beat. Highly recommended. Hazel eyes, medium skin.</li>
