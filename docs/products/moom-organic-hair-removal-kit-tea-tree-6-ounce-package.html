            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this wax!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase ~</li>
            <li>After seeing the awesome reviews on here, I had to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it was delicious, but I don&#x27;t eat it by the spoonful</li>
            <li>I have got to say this is the best type of hair removal I have ever come</li>
            <li>but it is the best option I&#x27;ve found.</li>

            <li>I done alot of research trying to figure out what was best to use,and it was all the reveiws I had read here on Amazon,that made me choose Moom.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and works wonderfully well to get all the hairs out.</li>
            <li>So today I tried the unbleached coffee filters cut to size-they worked perfectly and best of all are disposable.....</li>
            <li>This is just awesome!</li>
            <li>This product was awesome!</li>
            <li>Ladies and gents, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>It works best for me with one heat cycle in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I endured letting the hair get longer, as they say that makes the product work best.  </li>
            <li>It is a truly wonderful hair removal method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended it to both my sister AND my best friend!</li>

            <li>delicious,  almost smells like something I&#x27;d feed to my nephews and neice.</li>
            <li>A sugar based wax is the best because it comes off with water.  </li>
            <li>The price is great!</li>
            <li>After reading all of the great reviews, I had no reason not to buy it!</li>

            <li>Taste&#x27;s good too!!</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>but it worked for me and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Moom!!!</li>
            <li>I found that to be a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li>I used it for my bikini area, and it was very successful.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant, but this will guarantee irritate your skin so ice it afterwards.</li>
            <li>This was an amazing experience!!</li>
            <li>so I ordered and just tried it this afternoon with very good results.</li>
            <li>it works very good.</li>
            <li>works very very good.</li>
            <li>, I did not have the ideal conditions: I have three children</li>
            <li>it was VERY easy to do!!</li>
            <li>and may your results be loved!</li>
            <li>, I loved it!</li>
            <li>Works really good!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even take off the fine hairs!!!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t all that great..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product, and the results.</li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>Great results</li>
            <li>Works great...</li>
            <li>and I always get great results every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading all the great reviews by everyone else.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought Moom from curiosity, and found the product to be great.</li>
            <li>But it worked GREAT on my bikini area that hadn&#x27;t been taken care of in a month or two.   </li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>Ive never heard of this brand before but all of the reviews were great</li>
            <li>The product is great, I&#x27;m quite happy w/</li>
            <li>great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that it has been almost 7 days</li>
            <li>What a great surprise.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>Noticed the great reviews for Moom</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I am still really happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and none of them worked so great.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m NOT an experienced waxer, so that may be part of the reason.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>The sugar mixture and the cloth strips work GREAT together.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Seeing all the great reviews, I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie--I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great as all of the reviews had set it out to be, but all I could do was say \\&quot;Wow!\\</li>
            <li>It lives up to its great reviews.</li>
            <li>great product and received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Before she was using Sallys waxing kit and it wasnt as great as moom.</li>
            <li>It works great and it seems like it grabs all the hair in one pull</li>
            <li>This product is great if you have chemical sensitivities or allergies to chemical products and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It is a great alternative to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great on all areas that you have waxed before or never shaved.</li>
            <li>It worked great for me.</li>
            <li>however there were no bumps or any irritation that she usually experienced with plucking.</li>
            <li>Both her and I were happy about that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I was really happily suprised at how well the product works.</li>
            <li>The cloth strips are great as they can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li>Great product if your just wanting to try out wax or even if you have been doing it for awhile now.</li>
            <li>My Arab friends always relied on the sugaring method, but even though their eyebrows and face looked great</li>
            <li>The GREAT thing about this product is that it WASHES off with WATER.  </li>
            <li>but my eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li>Eureka, I was so happy.  </li>
            <li>I have had great results using it on my face  and arms.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this and have great results.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate and it works great.</li>
            <li>i was happy thinking it would work.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my face.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had great experiences with them...</li>
            <li>I was happy to read that sugaring is gentler because it doesn&#x27;t pull off a layer of skin like waxing does.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>great for the skin as well.</li>
            <li>Some people have commented that they did not have a great result with the product</li>
            <li>lol   </li>
            <li>I was so happy to have found suh a great organic non-toxic hair removal kit.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my legs and arms</li>
            <li>I heard great things about Moom</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so something like this is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent for those who work with this kind of material at the hair salon...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product , and happy not to have to spend time in the mirror, plucking hair off my chin with a pair of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product, but nope.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>All of the great things about wax</li>
            <li>Great for brazilian waxes.  </li>
            <li>It is so great to see the root of the hairs on the strips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just not that great.</li>
            <li>Great customer service as always from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to try this hair removal kit...</li>
            <li>but it would be really great if you had someone else to do those parts for</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is my 1st time trying any type of at home wax, so maybe that is my problem, but this stuff didn&#x27;t work as great as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>So - I got brave.  </li>
            <li>Ahhhhh the love!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!  </li>
            <li>Package came very nice.</li>
            <li>But it is very effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li>your room is very warm</li>
            <li>The wax  adheres well to the hair and removes it very effectively</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this wax is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Moom sugar wax is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I used the oil provided after and all of the wax was gone AMAZING !</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>But this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing buy!</li>
            <li>Everyone who&#x27;s not already a pro at making sugar waxes would be well-justified in buying this kit one time for many happy hairless years!</li>
            <li>In fact, it just makes me even more impressed that I managed to pull it out!</li>
            <li>One drop did land on my skin, so I rubbed it off with warm water - NO STICKY RESIDUE!     </li>
            <li>After going to places like Walmart and settling for whatever chemical-laden products they have on the shelf, I am thrilled to find this!</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>then this product is NOT FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise: You will LOVE it since it works GREAT!</li>
            <li>Most excellent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled why this product supposedly worked perfect for so many people.</li>
            <li>I already ordered more and already told my best friend to order it!!</li>
            <li>SUCCESSFULLY-</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another nice feature!</li>
            <li>Before trying this product, I was using another famous brand (Nads) and was very happy about it.</li>
            <li>And this is the most wonderful item there is.</li>
            <li>and it removed my hair nicely!</li>
            <li>Warm up, apply, remove- done!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, remove, and does an excellent job with the hair.  </li>
            <li>The best part--it is so easy that you can do it at home without the expense of going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off easy, great money saver to wax at home!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t very good at controlling the application and accidently ripped out more eyebrows than wanted.</li>
            <li>I tried this after reading so many great reviews, however my experience was anything but great.</li>
            <li>Bikini line and eyebrows worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>I managed to wax my legs fairly effortlessly.</li>
            <li>This wax doesn&#x27;t have a good grip of the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this MOOM product and it is really good.</li>
            <li>The product itself is really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it may not be for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews about this product</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>It smells good, 100% organic, tastes good, (I had some on my fingers and licked it off</li>
            <li>: This product has good ingredients</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This product is too good...</li>
            <li>so I bought the pre waxed strips because it said it was good for beginners.</li>
            <li>I have a good feeling about it though</li>
            <li>Good luck to all those who use this</li>
            <li>She loved the results.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t like the pain but loved the result so she&#x27;ll keep it up.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on removing the hair though it does take a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a kit, and a good price, to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for a good product I can do at home</li>
            <li>and I read good reviews on Moom wax</li>
            <li>so my conclusion is that it might be good for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>If I microwave it about 15 seconds, the texture is good to spread</li>
            <li>tastes good if some gets in your mouth while doing lip area.</li>
            <li>It didnt come with good instructions either</li>
            <li>this product is good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if people expect having hair ripped out of your body to feel good</li>
            <li>The instructions make this product sound so unbelievably wonderful.</li>
            <li>For those who didn&#x27;t have a good experience, this is how I use it and it works perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good before using.</li>
            <li>so I could be good for about 7 days until it bugged the heck out of me again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tested in both ways (without heat and with heat) and it came out decently good.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel completely fair to deduct from my rating when the product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s superior to waxing with chemical laden wax or using chemical hair dissolving creams.</li>
            <li>Good for exfoliating maybe.  </li>
            <li>This product was not as good a</li>
            <li>This is a good product to buy.</li>
            <li>Good product, and</li>
            <li>I just get so excited when I find a great all-natural (and organic!)</li>
            <li>It works best in its original form.</li>
            <li>So easy!!</li>
            <li>It was so easy!!</li>
            <li>The primary ingredient is sugar, so it&#x27;s very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It works great, with very detailed directions that help you get results.</li>
            <li>But very nice loved it besides that :)</li>
            <li>worked fine!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li>This part is really a great concept, I just wish it worked better than wax.  </li>
            <li>Moom is a great product, have used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>She was very pleased about that.</li>
            <li>Works great, there is a learning curve for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Baby or talcum powder is great, helps the wax stick more to the hairs than the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>pleased with quality of product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great product, so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this product. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I \\&quot;wow\\&quot;ed and laughed because it was so amazing.</li>
            <li>It also did a thorough job removing hair and didn&#x27;t leave very many strays.</li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews</li>
            <li>Sure, it sounds like a great idea - organic, no waxes or petroleum, etc.  </li>
            <li>It gives u everything u need to try out the product, which I ended up loving, and it&#x27;s a great price :-)</li>
            <li>It also has a very light, clean scent, and the reusable strips are great!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>It was the most amazing thing ever!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so I don&#x27;t need any more oil on my face!     </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s even organic!  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it was working, so I watched the tutorial video and tried again.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The first try I did on unwashed arm pit hairs and did an excellent job, without any pain.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I love that it washes off so well!</li>
            <li>I switched to Nair&#x27;s milk &amp; honey rollon, which is also water soluble, much better results!</li>
            <li>I was so glad I did!</li>
            <li>This product is even a more cost effective choice for me as well!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to all of my friends considering waxing and will continue to do so, this product is just fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I can handle this route for sure!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;--Waxing causes just as many ingrowns as shaving if you don&#x27;t exfoliate after use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it now three times, and I have to say the best way to use it is exactly how the directions say.</li>
            <li>Love this sugar wax!</li>
            <li>Gotta love a wax that comes off with water!</li>
            <li>Its more like $20 because the product itself, shipping an handling and taxes!</li>
            <li>I also love that you can just wash off the cloth strips and use them again!</li>
            <li>So glad that I found that out!</li>
            <li>I recommend this stuff for sure!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF and just ordered it again!</li>
            <li>At first I tried applying Moom at room temperature (as a reviewer suggested it is best applied so).</li>
            <li>I love my moom hair remover!</li>
            <li>OK!</li>
            <li>But the pain lasts 2 or 3 seconds, and the results are outstanding!</li>
            <li>I love that this is water soluble!  </li>
            <li>I love that I can reuse the strips, too!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>and I totally love it!</li>
            <li>I love this wax!</li>
            <li>the thinner the better!</li>
            <li>I can go from like to love!</li>
            <li>I started using this about two or three months ago, and i just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, nontoxic, and, best of all, very easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this because I now know how great sugaring is (very easy, practically painless)</li>
            <li>Application is easy, and the strips that are provided are great quality unbleached cotton.</li>
            <li>The strips are great and the product washes out of them easily</li>
            <li>I think the product may be fine for a salon or an experienced user.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use according to the directions and very effective on my leg.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>What is amazing about this product is that it acts like wax, but you can&#x27;t burn yourself and everything washes off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s amazing how this stuff washes off</li>
            <li>Thank you Moom for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Moom is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I was stunned with how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is amazing - truly.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Cleans up with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the reusable cloth strips since they were really easy to wash clean after each use.    </li>
            <li>i never tried waxing at home but  after reading so many  good reviews, i wanted to try this product</li>
            <li>it washes away with warm water.</li>
            <li>It also came off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it washes away with warm water.</li>
            <li>It also came off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing that&#x27;s nice about this is that the cloths that are use to place over the sugar substance can be washed and reused.</li>
            <li>and I put the product jar in a bowl with warm water.</li>
            <li>Okay, MOOM is good.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>packaging- organic- nice marketing concept/</li>
            <li>- It takes some practice to learn how to use it effectively.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also make your own sugar wax (recipes found online).  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best home hair removal product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;ve tried every kind of wax under the sun and none of it removes my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better/cheaper to just make your own sugar wax at home.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this product works for men too, albeit far from perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really liked how the wax didn&#x27;t get everywhere</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s under heated it doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair.</li>
            <li>But its just not as effective as wax...</li>
            <li>Nice that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>and if your just doing your face you don&#x27;t even have to warm the wax up...</li>
            <li>I decided to go lady-balls to the wall and get a waxing kit and honestly, it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit</li>
            <li>While I liked this product for my legs</li>
            <li>It is quite catching.  </li>
            <li>After I used up the pot I made a batch of my own since, having used the Moom, I knew what it was supposed to look and feel like.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I hoped</li>
            <li>As soon as it hit my skin it got all mealy not at all like warm honey.  </li>
            <li>The sugar wax rinsed off the strips easily in warm water</li>
            <li>my leg hairs are well accustom to this kind of treatment.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>I think I will heat the wax in a pot on the stove as directed and then use the heater to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t eat, so this fits in nicely with that.</li>
            <li>The reviews on Amazon were good and the price was better on Amazon than on Groupon.</li>
            <li>Just soak them in warm water and rinse.</li>
            <li>She keeps recommending it to me; but I don&#x27;t have the guts to wax on my own yet.</li>
            <li>(hey, it happens to all of us), just put some warm water on it and it disappears.</li>
            <li>and I burned my skin, now that is my own fault, but still.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO thrilled to discover this product - thank you, thank you makers of MOOM for this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also a bonus that you get to reuse the strips - cost and eco effective.</li>
            <li>but once I was done, I just hopped in the shower and rinsed the sugar off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Good, and you can use many times without risk.</li>
            <li>Good and safe, for people who have no time to go out, you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li>The reuseable strips are nice</li>
            <li>nice as it was to have a wax kit that was organic and water-soluble, I will not be buying this again, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can now keep up with my brows and bikini line in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own issues with waxing</li>
            <li>The muslin strips are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Just microwave for 3 minutes, mix and apply warm with a stick, let solidify (1-2minutes) and peel off.</li>
            <li>tried many methods, and the best are: go pay for it to be done right, or get a body trimmer, and just keep the hair, albeit trimmed.</li>
            <li>Gentle, great value, very effective.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, wax is malleable and heats up in 10 seconds, the strips are also nice, and the oil is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Made my saturday night worth staying in!!!</li>
            <li>the first couple of times were though to do, one of the reason why I said that is great for those who are already good with this hair removal technique.</li>
            <li>The sugar washes off the reusable strips n application tools very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably get the goo on things but comes off anything very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>I will admit my first yank of the cloth was very surprising...</li>
            <li>We have been purchasing this for almost two years or more now and are always happy with the results and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This product works great and is not painful.</li>
            <li>The best trick for me is applying baby powder since I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I have to mention that I think real wax would probably work better, but this is great for the price and for what I use it for (face)!</li>
            <li>Easy, and smell is good.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d have one super great brow and one...</li>
            <li>I would like to see more strips and stick included with the kit, and the jar tends to get really sticky around the edges, hence the 4 stars, otherwise everything was great!</li>
            <li>A good amount of hair was easily removed&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27; rinses with water, the strips wash off VERY easily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>The cloths that come with the product rinse out very easily and the product also rinses off skin easilly as well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>So, I was nervous the first time I used MOOM, but the experience was really good!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good; can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Very easy cleanup with warm water and love that the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li>I have tried anywhere between 5 and 10 products, and Moom is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair removal kit I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair removal for my face</li>
            <li>but Moom is the best so far.</li>
            <li>and it took a good minute to break it free with my fingers.</li>
            <li>It is the best wax I ever used by so far</li>
            <li>I watched a YouTube instructional video on how to use the product most effectively (posted by Moom).</li>
            <li>This was the most ineffective kind of wax I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to warm the jar up as soon as I saw it thickening again.    </li>
            <li>The sugar wax smells delicious, rinsed off with water, and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The day after my skin was gorgeous and hair free.  </li>
            <li>I need to warm it up much more than the instructions said but that could be my microwave.</li>
            <li>and well it&#x27;s worth a try with all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>each use, you become more adept.  </li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with Moom.</li>
            <li>It also comes off so easily, which is perfect for when you use too much or drop some of it on your skin.</li>
            <li>But really, the best thing about Moom is how easily it comes off your skin and the cloth you use to wax.</li>
            <li>This one is very gentle yet VERY effective and I am super happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li>The hair came off easily and I was VERY satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>And cleanup is so easy with Moom!</li>
            <li>Also, it cleans up and washes off RIDICULOUSLY easy!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love love love this wax!</li>
            <li>It does how ever clean up very easy, so that is a plus!</li>
            <li>works great and not very painful</li>
            <li>It is definitely more effective with longer hair but still did not get all of the hair, even with more then one attempt.</li>
            <li>Overall though, great product and one that I am happy to have added to my subscription list.</li>
            <li>It was good in removing the hair and did not need to be repeated to clean up the skin.</li>
            <li>But I do know I am so happy, and empowered that I can do this all on my own and can save so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike wax, which requires special oils to remove, Moom is made out of sugar, so it washes off very easily with water, which also allows you to reuse the cloth!  </li>
            <li>I have learned how to pull just right and at an angle to get those more course hairs under control but it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good because warm water will wash it right off your clothes and body, and also because you don&#x27;t have to heat it up to use it.</li>
            <li>But in general it is great!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried waxing and this product made the experience unforgettable.</li>
            <li>you are willing to take the time and effort to learn how to use this, it is a great alternative to waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>I am pretty experienced with at home waxing.  </li>
            <li>First off, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>All the good things written about this product were true for me.  </li>
            <li>This sounded to good to be true.  </li>
            <li>- It doesn&#x27;t work on fine hair!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super effective, once you figure out the ideal temperature (if you try to start when it&#x27;s too hot, it won&#x27;t work).  </li>
            <li>I love the strips that is came with, its so easy and they are reusable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap      Cons:  </li>
            <li>(like, try a very light dusting of cornstarch before using).</li>
            <li>Skin is very smooth after using remover.</li>
            <li>It also leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and effective</li>
            <li>As someone who has been waxing my own legs for a couple of years, MOOM was easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The warm product wouldn&#x27;t spread easily.  </li>
            <li>how well it worked and how easy it was to keep a nice brow line.</li>
            <li>easy to use and effective</li>
            <li>Went on smooth, love the reusable fabric strips!</li>
            <li>After finishing up , I tossed the muslin strips in a sink full of warm water for about five minutes, and was happy to see that all of the Moom and hair rinsed right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion, works really best on dry, uncleaned hair and witch hazel is an awesome sensitive smoother.ooth, unsticky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion, works really best on dry, uncleaned hair and witch hazel is an awesome sensitive smoother.</li>
            <li>it smells great, easy to use, easy clean up, organic and reusable strips.</li>
            <li>I did try it on my legs, and it worked fine there with longer hair, but honestly it is easier to shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s warm and it works just fine at room temperature.    </li>
            <li>Not to mention, unless you&#x27;re a corpse your skin is warm and this thing is made mainly of sugar which liquefies even more on warm skin!</li>
            <li>just ran out but plan to order just more of the wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and this is a joke.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked on bikini area better just because hairs there were thicker.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this or tell a friend about this product, I would let them know that like most \\&quot;as seen on tv \\</li>
            <li>and i m very much pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I received and am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>okay let&#x27;s not mention the fact I can&#x27;t even see my bikini area</li>
            <li>and I had much better success.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing I love most about Moom is that it is all-natural</li>
            <li>-Ok</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold your skin taunt too, because it also reduces the pain.    </li>
            <li>I then started buying store brands since they were more convenient.</li>
            <li>I do recommend buying more though.</li>
            <li>This one was more successful, as I had pulled most of the wax off with the first strip.</li>
            <li>no need to buy chupa chups anymore :)</li>
            <li>I probably used more wax</li>
            <li>I guess there was one more concern</li>
            <li>Thank you Moom! :-)</li>
            <li>even thought I saw many reviewers complaining.</li>
            <li>but I hope after repeated uses it will get better.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s OK if you have more time and patience.</li>
            <li>I have tried over the counter Sallys wax products that work better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Cute</li>
            <li>+ times to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a wax warmer or more sticks/strips if you wash and reuse them.  </li>
            <li>I gave Moom one more try before I trashed it and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Overall the best type of this product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I tried heating it up more....</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li>* make sure your skin is taught before pulling the strip off - if it isn&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get a lot of pain and no hair removal  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>yes, fellow noobs, it hurts, but it&#x27;s better than dealing with razor bumps and slicing up the skin.</li>
            <li>but it sure worked for a guy.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s been more than a week since I contacted them, and I&#x27;m yet to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give you plenty of washable applicators and cloth removers, which I also love.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I will ever try anything else. :)</li>
            <li>I got this like most people hoping for an alternative to wax that worked just as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wax - removes most of the hair&lt;br /&gt;Moom</li>
            <li>I found it helped to heat it up quite a bit more than the directions indicate</li>
            <li>The wax managed to get most of both.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the product is heated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works much much better when it&#x27;s a more liquid-like consistency</li>
            <li>-Use more of a peeling motion, not a ripping motion.</li>
            <li>Its worked better on my eye brows</li>
            <li>I love Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many hair removal product at home</li>
            <li>You will also need more Moom if you intend to do your legs.  </li>
            <li>Women that don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair and don&#x27;t make mistakes with the Moom may be able to Moom more body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find I was able to use a strip twice.  </li>
            <li>The reusable strips are a plus too, since it saves me more money than buying disposable ones every time.</li>
            <li>And love that the application sticks and cloth strips are reusable</li>
            <li>The waxes I used pulled on skin more than the hair, but not this product.</li>
            <li>It did took out most of the hair, but not all.</li>
            <li>This way the hair follicles aren&#x27;t smoothed and silken by the wash and therefore the product grabs the hair more.</li>
            <li>I did it again because again it didn&#x27;t hurt so it surely didn&#x27;t pull any hair out...</li>
            <li>I guess i need more practice.</li>
            <li>Hi, I wanted to share what I thought was a better way to use this product to get results you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this helps &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>this helps &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>When you evaluate 1) benefit of not having to shave as often and 2) the smoothness after using  and compare it to the pain you endure while ripping it off, I guess it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this product, but</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t do its primary job, which is ripping those hairs out!  </li>
            <li>After reading through many reviews I decided to go ahead and go for it.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and tried it out last night and it worked great!!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>(When I purchased this Amazon did not offer free shipping on the lavender or rose versions.)</li>
            <li>its ok i just thought it would work better based on the reviews</li>
            <li>I tried waxing my underarms, as per the instructions, and its better than my palor ... Will surely go for its refill pack s</li>
            <li>I ended up dipping the applicator sticks to the bottom and swirling the liquid from the bottom on top and using that instead.  </li>
            <li>I then tried the sally hansen al over body wax because it had the strips, which I thought would be more comfortable...better than the brazilian</li>
            <li>- I go through way too many muslin strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be able to wax my legs and bikini area about 4-5 times.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find Moom.</li>
            <li>I want to love this product..</li>
            <li>Although I love the idea of this product...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull a lot of hair out, takes practice to be able to use correctly</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also many pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>But it is definitely interesting</li>
            <li>Now I like it. :)</li>
            <li>As everyone knows, no hair removal method is perfect (there is always a \\&quot;catch\\&quot;) , but I am thinking that MOOM might be the lesser of the evils that I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay lets face it, when you pull hair out by the roots it&#x27;s gonna hurt.</li>
            <li>(I believe she actually enjoyed it, giving me pain that is)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I read that using baby powder helps the wax adhere better</li>
            <li>I totally fall in love with this Wax product, it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>but I mostly do it myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a pressure as you pull it off your skin.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;ve been waxing for years, just watch it to make sure you know how to apply it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and so does my sister and my mother.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>It worked ok on my face and my legs.</li>
            <li>I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time.</li>
            <li>I feel like anything organic, is better than those synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li>iv every had even better then</li>
            <li>Worked great, came fast.</li>
            <li>I also love that if I get it in a spot I didn&#x27;t want to, I can just remove the product with water-unlike wax which you are stuck with once placed.</li>
            <li>Now, for the part most people probably want to hear about....</li>
            <li>I try to sit in the evenings to pluck, but more times then I care to admit</li>
            <li>If I could give this product 20 stars I would. :)</li>
            <li>Ok, a guy here.</li>
            <li>I am working out, don&#x27;t want to look like chewbacca like my father and most of my uncles.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my lovely girlfriend as she has been wanting to try waxing for some time now.</li>
            <li>and MOOM was a fantastic choice!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I decided to give Moom a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>However, this works well for most hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the results and plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better waxes.</li>
            <li>This product works PERFECTLY if used properly and</li>
            <li>so I am confident that I did apply the product and use it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother buying them any more.  </li>
            <li>I presume that with practice I&#x27;ll become both more timely and more graceful at \\&quot;MOOMing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waxing salon professionals always say that the more you wax, the better quality your hair will become over time.</li>
            <li>I love it but its easier to use your hand than kit&#x60;s tools</li>
            <li>I was even able to do my butt, but not without some struggle I have to admit</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>top of that</li>
            <li>My skin has never been happier :)</li>
            <li>but I wish the quantity was more.</li>
            <li>I will need some practice for sure.</li>
            <li>I love that the cloth strips are reusable.  </li>
            <li>I seriously love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product and it dose work</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d love to remove it all in one</li>
            <li>When you look through the reviews all you see are the five star reviews on top-</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;waxing\\&quot; kit is cute, but it&#x27;s LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than waxing tweezing or threading for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I could do it myself</li>
            <li>I am another satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>This organic wax is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Love that it washes off with water if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I find it easier to buy the prewax strips and use those as they seem to work so much better for me everytime.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some famous brands of wax before trying Moom.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll practice more</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this when there is better products out there..</li>
            <li>I was happy the pain was really reduced.</li>
            <li>When I would try and use the Moom  it would remove most of the hair</li>
            <li>My bikini line was a bit more of a challenge</li>
            <li>I am going to try IPL next, but nothing seems to be perfect yet.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I&#x27;m a strict vegan and of course organic, no honey, and no animal testing caught my attention.  </li>
            <li>Anything thats more watery wont work as well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work on most of the hair...</li>
            <li>This wax is just OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>This way the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; grabs on to the hairs and also is able to adhere to the fabric strips.</li>
            <li>As I use the \\&quot;moom\\&quot; stuff more</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve gotten better at getting the results</li>
            <li>Okay, I never write reviews for anything..</li>
            <li>I love the fact you can use the strips over and over again.  </li>
            <li>i prefer nads much more</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hopeful that as I continue the product will work more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I also really love the cloth strips that are reusable.</li>
            <li>Better on the skin though.</li>
            <li>i guess once i get used to it, it&#x27;ll be better</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love organic and washable clothes.</li>
            <li>I have never done a self waxing before so after reading reviews I though this would be okay to start.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read all of the instructions, DON&#x27;T overheat the wax, I myself haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li>so make sure you exfoliate the area</li>
            <li>This makes the wax have a more honey consistancy and it easier to apply.</li>
            <li>after and 48hr later procedure which I have perfected over time using this product and now get awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>best thing is that it does not damage the skin like regular wax.</li>
            <li>but i would prefer if there is more strips it would be better</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but there has to be a better way</li>
            <li>I had to go over each side three times to make sure I got it all, but I figured with practice I&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I did my upper lip, legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried waxing for probably 2-3 years, but this is so much better than that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect that there is any better product on this planet for hair removal with this</li>
            <li>( i made sure of it)</li>
            <li>According to the directions, it will get better each time you apply the product, THAT will never happen again.</li>
            <li>It looked more runny, OK.</li>
            <li>it works so much better.</li>
            <li>After you get the starter kit, you can re-use the cloths so ordering just the hair remover itself is even more cost-effective.</li>
            <li>I love the washable cloth strips (that I re-use each time).  </li>
            <li>so it was rather time consuming, but I was totally satisfied with the end result to not think about the time it took to get there.  </li>
            <li>I know with more practice</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a clutz.</li>
            <li>Although it took me many intents.</li>
            <li>But if I let the hair grow out a bit, this works like magic.</li>
            <li>I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to get any better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to lay it in the direction of the hair to be removed, then lay the strip over it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I felt like I was competing with my husband on the mustache thing :).  </li>
            <li>I would give this more stars if possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency would be great for grabbing hold of very stubborn hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was in love.</li>
            <li>anyways, I shave most of my hair.</li>
            <li>stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li>If it lasts for more than a day, I&#x27;m not going to use this product again.</li>
            <li>I think it worked as my face felt better.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t pull all hair, but is okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>worked okay ..</li>
            <li>good part is it is easy clean up</li>
            <li>and it does work for the most part (not as well on stubborn bikini hairs though)</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I thought I might get better with practice.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is lovely.</li>
            <li>The thinner you spread this stuff the better results you will have.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used dozens of home waxes over the last decade and this is the best.</li>
            <li>After some practice the next time I went to use it it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I go after at a time the better it is removed...</li>
            <li>More than.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase and really works.</li>
            <li>I love that the clothes are reusable and the sticks were included as well.</li>
            <li>I love that is it organic.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just wished it would pick up more hair.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that its organic (and that is important) and the wax is soft on the skin when applied.</li>
            <li>I think this helped make sure that most of the hairs came off.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m so glad I found Moom.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff almost pain free so much better then wax</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>More quantity.</li>
            <li>i experienced some irritation but it cleared right up after applying some thayers witch hazel (alcohol free).  </li>
            <li>however I am very familiar with waxing as I have been doing it forever.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s natural (which was the best part, honestly).</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use it</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that it is made of environmentally friendly products - even the strips are reusable!</li>
            <li>This is a nice advantage over waxes, which require baby oil or wax removal products to clean.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was in love with this product, but as time went on, while Moom is good on the face, it seemed to give me underarm pimples.</li>
            <li>All you need is warm water and soap to clean Moom off your skin, the reusable cloth strips, and any surface where it might have dripped.</li>
            <li>They rinsed completely clean after soaking in warm water.  </li>
            <li>You may think that the muslin strips will not be reusable, but they rinse out clean under warm water.</li>
            <li>I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!</li>
            <li>This is superb for bikini area waxing, that&#x27;s pretty much all</li>
            <li>Moom is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Those methods are fine for most areas, but far from ideal for for others.</li>
            <li>am willing to pay any amount of money for good products...</li>
            <li>, so I tried this stuff on my legs first and even though it didn&#x27;t rip all the hair out, it got a good amount.</li>
            <li>Which wasn&#x27;t that surprising to me, as I read the manual, followed the directions exactly and got the results the product promised.</li>
            <li>But lo and behold, my first time results were as good as professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty good, though like I said I&#x27;ll need some practice, so</li>
            <li>the first couple of pages) thinking that this would be good, so i ordered it, As soon as i got</li>
            <li>An absolute MUST HAVE for anyone wanting to do their own waxing!</li>
            <li>Moom sounded too good to be true - cloths you clean and reuse?</li>
            <li>... useful, nice and pleasant ;)&lt;br /&gt;... and tasty as well...</li>
            <li>well worth it!!</li>
            <li>I was able to wash off easily, and I had set the jar on the side of my sink, where the bottom had some on it, creating a ring that stuck to the sink.</li>
            <li>I was able to wash off easily, and I had set the jar on the side of my sink, where the bottom had some on it, creating a ring that stuck to the sink.</li>
            <li>I love that the strips are reusable, and that the residue washed off easily off of my skin and the strips.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and stays warm.</li>
            <li>Wash face, dry, use the cornstarch and the best time is before bed.</li>
            <li>I always use Moom, it&#x27;s amazing and works super well.</li>
            <li>You can always remove more hair, you can&#x27;t replace it once it&#x27;s gone nearly as easily</li>
            <li>The great part about it is that, since it&#x27;s sugar, it washes off anything simply with warm water.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the nice smell, the reuasble strips, and the easy clean up, however I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>There were plenty of cloth strips included, and they were very easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li>I love how effect the waxing is and how easy it is to clean up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to heat with the glass jar and super easy to clean both my skin after use and the cloth strips, just use warm water, no soap needed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for sure!</li>
            <li>But if you do as the booklet says and wait 2 weeks after shaving an area, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this product&#x27;s efficacy varies from person to person depending on method of use, as well as skin and hair type, but for me it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It washes away easily with warm water and the reusable strips are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I started on an area with very light, fine hair to test for easy removal.</li>
            <li>...how very cool is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  -If you decide to warm up the wax by letting it float in hot water, make sure to put the Moom jar in the container, then fill the container up with water.</li>
            <li>The stuff works and its a great, natural product.  </li>
            <li>It works great and barely hurts :-).  </li>
            <li>I bought a box of tongue depressors here on amazon (really cheap for 500 in a box), and i find them to be a better applicator than the skinny sticks...</li>
            <li>That is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy this is an all natural product and comes with these reusable cloths.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Most importantly I applied baby powder before applying the sugaring.  </li>
            <li>, this was the best $17 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>but it would have been more helpful with detailed instructions for people who have never used before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, like myself.  </li>
            <li>I left there in incredible pain that didn&#x27;t go away for almost a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable to do at home, plus it allows your spouse to inflict pain upon you.  </li>
            <li>As far as wax goes, the product seems great.</li>
            <li>I was nervous trying it at first because of some of the one-star reviews, but I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>One day I ordered this Moom Hair Removal because I needed to order some more to get \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; ordering online.  </li>
            <li>Shaving has never been ideal for me, especially in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I USUALLY DO 20 SEC TO ME THAT PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Everything else about the product is good for a reasonably priced at-home kit.</li>
            <li>it is worth a try and a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>Now, I can manscape the whole area in about 20 minutes and it stays good for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up!</li>
            <li>This product is great, easy to use and not a messy cleanup.</li>
            <li>It removes hair very effectively, quickly, and most importantly PAINLESSLY!</li>
            <li>and theres no mess, which is great for skin and bathroom.</li>
            <li>tried to make my own sugar at home and it wasn&#x27;t the right consistency</li>
            <li>I had to heat it a just a bit because right out of the container it wouldn&#x27;t spread at all, but heated just a bit it spread nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) Definitly have it sitting in some sort of warm water bath to keep it the right temperature.</li>
            <li>Much lowere than most products in the store and works better to boot!</li>
            <li>I ordered thinking it was going to be great because all the reviews seemed real and honest and made it sound like it really worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy after you get practice, the wax washes right off the strips and body with warm water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly familiar with most kinds of hair removal: shaving, waxing, epilating, laser.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that I believe this is an excellent product, and I have recommended it to friends that have issues with some of the other types of hair removers.  </li>
            <li>just did bikini area for a patch test, gonna try and tackle a full Brazilian ASAP!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also my first time using any sort of wax product, and I can say without a doubt, I&#x27;m glad it was this!</li>
            <li>Since I am familiar with the waxing process (have tried waxing on legs, underarms etc as well as the experience of having it done so many times)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>but I really liked this product, it is natural and I love the easy to use directions!  </li>
            <li>Moom went on easily and cleaned up just as easily.</li>
            <li>Product easily washes away with water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was wonderfully easy</li>
            <li>This was wonderfully easy</li>
            <li>I do love that it is so easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>so I let my hair grow which wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easily removes hair with no pain at all.</li>
            <li>Smell is very, very mild</li>
            <li>and it is incredibly easy to make.</li>
            <li>It is very quick to heat up and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The goal is to make Moom easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>and how the strips are easily washed and reused.     </li>
            <li>am most happy with the muslin cloths, especially since they&#x27;re washable, which means that you don&#x27;t have to throw them away and replace them.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it gets cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li>The fabric strips were easy to grab and there are plenty of them.</li>
            <li>And the clean-up was so easy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really happy with MOOM :-)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to do it yourself and a ton cheaper.</li>
            <li>I find it to be convenient and an easy to use alternative to going to the salon.</li>
            <li>MOOM is easy to heat</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easy to remove excess sugar with damp washrag</li>
            <li>and I easily get sweaty.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spread with the sticks</li>
            <li>I use this product on my face, and it was sooooo easy.  </li>
            <li>Plus the wax in the jar gets thicken very quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought it hadn&#x27;t pulled the hair out), easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how easy, and well this product worked.</li>
            <li>The wax does not come off easily either,it was literally stuck on my leg, i had to keep washing it off</li>
            <li>Was hoping this product would actually be easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The wax comes off fairly easily.</li>
            <li>was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it is so incredibly easy.</li>
            <li>Room temperature was not sufficient for spreading easily on the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strips and sticks are easily cleaned</li>
            <li>I like the review the says it is easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something that works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it was so easy to work with.</li>
            <li>is easy to apply, almost too easy.</li>
            <li>I gave 2 stars for the nice strips and super easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to heat</li>
            <li>this product is pretty good; it&#x27;s true that it does not give a chemical burn like some others</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all like wax, probably because it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of grip.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of messy and can be kind of stringy, but it cleans up very easily with just warm water.      </li>
            <li>I liked the smell and it was pretty easy to heat up in the microwave.</li>
            <li>For a first timer, this product is simply effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The wax is removed with just warm or hot water and the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I found it almost painless after a couple drinks.  ;)</li>
            <li>First time users will need a microwave or some way to warm the Moom; a towel, a bowl with soapy water; a wash cloth; and paper towels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily (warm tap water or handsoap &amp; water!).  </li>
            <li>I like the glass jar, so after heating it in the microwave you can place it in a bowl of hot water to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>time around I warmed it for 20 seconds at a time which made it really nice and runny so that, while hot (manageable for me)</li>
            <li>So easy to take off, and it came in the mail rather quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash off with water since it&#x27;s sugar-based and super inexpensive!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant, light scent and even though I am inexperienced, I waxed both my arms in 30 minutes (with also reading the directions).</li>
            <li>:) It was not painful at all...it leaves the skin smooth too.</li>
            <li>the was longer than 1/2&amp;#34; but it worked fine on my 3/4&amp;#34; leg hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that this would be a great product for upkeep but</li>
            <li>the hairs that I do have are extremely fine.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pain free and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>, the strips (like most strips) get frayed after first use, and got more frayed when I washed them</li>
            <li>but if you read the directions it should work fine.  </li>
            <li>I have black hair and this should be a the perfect hair to grad with wax.</li>
            <li>Remove about 50 -  60% of my fine leg hair.    </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t grab onto the fine hair.</li>
            <li>remove fine hairs</li>
            <li>The first time I used moom, I didn&#x27;t necessarily follow the step by step directions and hair removal was spotty at best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be razor free!</li>
            <li>Easy steps, not hugely painful and clean up was a breeze!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even made my own sugar wax at home (which worked great the first batch but ripped off a layer of skin with the second batch)..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to get off the skin.    </li>
            <li>Best ever, yes a bit messy but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I especially love that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off any excess or misplaced \\&quot;wax\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Its Easy, relatively painless and great value for money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 5 years and it continues to be easy to use and worth its price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This works great and easy (relatively) to use.</li>
            <li>The clean up is easy because once the wax hardens it&#x27;s not sticky and easily peels off any surface.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews for MOOM before purchasing and was pleased that there were so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This sugar wax is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, easy to remove (with water!)</li>
            <li>I agree with all of the reviewers: Easy to apply, easy to clean up, and (for me anyway) virtually pain free.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean up, and I love that the muslin strips are washable and reusable.</li>
            <li>I love that it is super easy to clean up if I get it on anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, in fact I am extremely pleased and would recommend this to anybody interested in being waxed.a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to recieve this in the mail because I had read so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more satisfied with other products, like GiGi Strip Free Wax, which is easy to use and much more effective.</li>
            <li>HUGE BUMMER.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would save time to apply a huge section and take it off in sections.</li>
            <li>easy clean up Semi pain free.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like reusing the strips, which you can because they clean up easily with warm water, but it grosses me out.  </li>
            <li>Easy clean up with water if you get it on something you shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Even the strips were amazingly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks Moon for including all the tools I need in the kit and for effective use at room temperature.</li>
            <li>100% hair free</li>
            <li>Great for my upper lip and bikini line!</li>
            <li>and this is SO EASY to clean up.</li>
            <li>But, overall, a great waxing product.</li>
            <li>Moom does clean up easily.</li>
            <li>Moom does clean up easily.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that not only did this product stand up to</li>
            <li>This product is water soluble and washes away clean and easily, with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li>The strips also rinse clean incredibly easily.       </li>
            <li>It is also important to mention how fantastic the instructions are.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and for a newbie to waxing, I did not feel any pain.</li>
            <li>As soon as it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a shot and have smooth, hairless legs.    </li>
            <li>I used 5 of the 10 wax strips and they were filled with hair.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>The wax strips and sticks run out faster than the wax, but you can get those anywhere relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean up and easy to clean the cloths strips that it came with</li>
            <li>For a girl who has dealt with semi-sensitive skin all my life, this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative than using one&#x27;s gas to drive to a beautician to do the job that will charge around the same price for this product for one visit.  </li>
            <li>Now I have comfortable feet</li>
            <li>I am a cheap, do-it-yourself type.</li>
            <li>But Moom is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I guess I read all the reviews that made this sound dreamy.</li>
            <li>I and its gentle and effective</li>
            <li>have used MOOM on my underarm, bikini and legs with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean off from my skin, the cloths and the applicator.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews here, I decided to be brave and try the Moom kit, and am definitely a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean up off your skin and the fabric is reuseable.</li>
            <li>My legs looked smooth but did not feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Sticky, messy, but nonetheless awesome!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great, and you can use i to get rid of hair of different areas.</li>
            <li>I like that the clean up is so easy and that the strips can be reused.</li>
            <li>But it does make my skin smooth after waxing.</li>
            <li>I thought why not try this wax since it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It does clean up easily</li>
            <li>I recommend picking up a cheap coaster-style candle warmer to go with your kit.  </li>
            <li>Moom is organic, with sugar (that is warmed) being the primary ingredient.  </li>
            <li>if you are considering Moom just go for it and be willing to play until you get a suitable method for you.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, and got smooth skin, but no hair removal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda messy getting it out of the jar, but I&#x27;m sure those of you who are more experienced or coordinated won&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li>Smooth exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>Also it was extremely easy to clean</li>
            <li>This product is also great for 1st time users because if you get it on your clothes, furniture, or excess amount on your skin it simply rinses off.  </li>
            <li>This product would be much more useful if it came as pre-treated strips to be applied out of box.</li>
            <li>I think for someone who&#x27;s had lots of experience with waxing would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this item has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Depilatory creams are also filled with chemicals and I am all about the naturals for my body.</li>
            <li>The price is great too, especially when you consider everything that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Today is the week mark of using moom and legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li>It gets three stars because it was easy to clean up and spread on, and after a week, it still feels like 12 hour growth.</li>
            <li>The sticks and fabrics bits are easy to clean, just use soap and water and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moom</li>
            <li>It worked and it was pain free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better and more gentle.</li>
            <li>I went in search of something more natural and effective and ordered Moom based on the customer reviews.</li>
            <li>You do have to have the technique, but I am far from a professional and the product worked great for me!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the good reviews and because it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and have used this product, its a good buy..</li>
            <li>The hair took a fair amount of time to return, (thank you all things GOOD and SWEET!), but I&#x27;m not sure I would venture to use this one again.</li>
            <li>The hair took a fair amount of time to return, (thank you all things GOOD and SWEET!), but I&#x27;m not sure I would venture to use this one again.</li>
            <li>As the title says I was very excited to try this product, and really wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it was very easy to use and more importantly, the clean up was easy too!</li>
            <li>NOT try this for the 1st time right before anything sexy or important.</li>
            <li>NOT try this for the 1st time right before anything sexy or important.</li>

            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that I was able to rinse off the fabric strips with tap water and they were clean and ready to be reused after drying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, because we all read the reviews and have to take the most popular statements and decide to go for the purchase or not.&lt;br /&gt;These reviews seem plausible, but truth be told I was able to get maybe 50% of the hair after the second try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine others will have to deal with this quite the same way I do, but you may find your hands get sticky and the damp wash cloth will be very handy.</li>
            <li>that was very useful.      </li>
            <li>Plus, the cloths really do rinse clean with warm water, just like advertised.     </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this to everyone:):)</li>
            <li>It leaves it smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically pain free and super easy to clean up after.</li>
            <li>smooth and clean</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be magically hair free the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to do.</li>
            <li>And it washed off super easily.</li>
            <li>Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini</li>
            <li>Sugar based product washed off super easy with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It cools quickly, and heats too hot very easily, so once you get it to that temperature that&#x27;s needed, keep it there</li>
            <li>It would be best to warm the Moom less, because your device that you use to warm the Moom may be more powerful - therefore needing less warming time.  </li>
            <li>It sounded good, looked easy enough...</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works well ( after a first try,) safe for my skin, and should last a good while.</li>
            <li>The original package I got of Moom came with some strips to use to remove the product when pulling out the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, in fact I am extremely pleased and would recommend this to anybody interested in being waxed.</li>
            <li>I have used original Moom Wax in the past, which worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is way better than wax and on my first eyebrow</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Maybe a set of friendly helping hands would have worked, too.  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s economical!</li>
            <li>I think a rookie waxer may have issues using this product, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing or willing to take your time to learn how to use the product (trial and error or YouTube tutorials), you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it, I got my first sugar waxing at Shobha in DC.  </li>
            <li>think hair removal was better the first time when I did not microwave the stuff.</li>
            <li>i was veery excited to try the moom hair removal after reading the reviews , when i tried it ( and i was comparing it to nads hair removal gel)  </li>
            <li>better than waxing and shaving, i never waxed or shaved and Moom is my first hair removal method</li>
            <li>and I too was so excited to use it that ones i started</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the product stated regrowth wouldn&#x27;t return until 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product, but I tried it and didnt work, NOT</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s cruelity free and natural makes it even better!</li>
            <li>and I think I follow the directions exactly but was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any sugar or waxing product, so I did have some missed hairs/broken hairs, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just user error and won&#x27;t be an issue with some practice.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to do this.</li>
            <li>I really love this wax, its easy to apply with the wooden applicators and it works very well with the strips that came along with it, even better than the strips can be reused just but rinsing it under warm water and letting it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on your skin and washes right off with warm water, do it is super easy to clean</li>
            <li>I have had some experience doing my own waxing at home, so i wanted to try something new,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely new to this kind of wax</li>
            <li>It took me around 20 minutes to clean off 4 strips.    </li>
            <li>and my guess is that it will take about 20 minutes, including having to clean up from body jerks into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my guess is that it will take about 20 minutes, including having to clean up from body jerks into the product.    </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel smooth and soft afterward, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give instruction on how to clean the strips</li>
            <li>I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li>I can find it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li>Everything washed clean and is drying now.</li>
            <li>You can clean the strips though -</li>
            <li>And the clean up is a breeze compared to wax, this product can be rinsed off with water...</li>
            <li>so clean up</li>
            <li>Doing some research, I discovered that sugaring is waxing&#x27;s nice cousin and felt it would be better for my skin than regular waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about waxing may still use it because it is so effective, but they don&#x27;t especially appreciate the pain.  </li>
            <li>you can clean and reuse the strips (after drying) which i needed to do to before i was done.</li>
            <li>This wax is awesome (just be careful not to heat it too much)</li>
            <li>So on my next pot I found a better option, I run the warm water into the sink and let the pot sit in the water for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I was still able to almost perfectly spread it paper thin and do the rest as instructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but because I need to do it regularly I thought I&#x27;d try to find a more cost effective solution.</li>
            <li>instead of oil, water is all it takes to clean up.</li>
            <li>to clean up&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter, and while it was undeniably easier to clean up, when I pulled off the strip</li>
            <li>&quot; So with that said, if you have a quiet, well-lit location with no children and you are not 7 months pregnant, you will probably love this product more and it will work even better for you.</li>
            <li>And that its all natural, even better!</li>
            <li>But for small, quick, hair removal, Moom is perfect.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this is that it is such easy clean up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to heat up and apply (if you have it at the right temperature).</li>
            <li>you had to use their special cleaning cloths, and 2.</li>
            <li>nothing particularly special</li>
            <li>An organic hair removal product with reusable applicators is right up my crunchy granola alley!  </li>
            <li>It looks great this time, with minimal redness and almost no stray hairs, and feels clean and cool.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited when I did my bikini area since it did hurt</li>
            <li>Now with my wedding a month away I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty experienced with all types of hair removal, especially waxing.</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse hair, which it isn&#x27;t great at removing when the hair is stubbly.</li>
            <li>I really liked this Moom starter kit, it had everything I needed and really made my first foray into the world of self-waxing easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>After letting it cool, it just made my hair sticky - think lollipop and would not come off on the strip.</li>
            <li>I washed all the strips and they are good to go for my next hair removal session.</li>
            <li>I love that the linen strips are reusable, and compared to salon prices, the refill jars are very affordable.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin nice and soft and it works, but it does take longer to use.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love MOOM so much.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m getting the whole kit again because i need more strips but</li>
            <li>I really liked that you can wash the cloths and it is not messy at all... &lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I love Moom so much?</li>
            <li>Each time there are a good amount of hairs left over that I have to pluck.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so not painful at all, and</li>
            <li>Soft, works, heat up just a tad or put container in warm water.  </li>
            <li>I did and found that to be true.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% pain free, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any at all-the jar still looks full.</li>
            <li>not so much :).....</li>
            <li>clean up was quick, just took water..</li>
            <li>But ants really like it, so make sure you keep it in a ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li>:) She has used the whole 6-ounce jar, which took around a month to use.</li>
            <li>Then, if you allow it to cool, it won&#x27;t spread, but it will grab your hairs and start pulling them immediately.  </li>
            <li>The directions in the package as well as the instructional video online are very helpful and made my hair removal even more thorough.</li>
            <li>I used to have my upper lip waxed a few times a year, but now I do my own at home with the greatest of ease with Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I let it cool off for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this product at home late one night while in bed (I know, not the best set up).      </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin and seems to cool off before you can even get it applied.</li>
            <li>Moom feels fresh and smooth after the job is done.</li>
            <li>I waited until my hairs were the full 1 cm (as recommended).  </li>
            <li>It is not painful and even gets easier each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>only used this once &amp; it seems to work good.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>or you applied to much and realize you won&#x27;t be able to remove the hair you can just remove it and do it again.</li>
            <li>&quot; ingredients also got me convinced and truely,</li>
            <li>It gets more hair in one go, it&#x27;s easier to work with, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>On top of it its organic, highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Move it to an airtight container and let it cool.</li>
            <li>This is true for any method of hit waxing: hair length should not exceed 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not painful at all.</li>
            <li>full of bs...</li>
            <li>I have only, used this once, but I bet once I get good at it</li>
            <li>I found a strip full of moom, and all the hair still on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I thought this would be something good to use for those gross, stray chin hairs you sometimes get.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product after seeing how much the reviews varied on it, but I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product - could use that temperature gauge thingy though.</li>
            <li>Package IS NOT BAD  </li>
            <li>other reviews say that doing large areas at a time give the best success, but I have to disagree</li>
            <li>I put the fabric over, and pulled, only to end up with it coming off like you&#x27;re pulling perfectly prepared pizza slices complete with just the right amount of cheese.</li>
            <li>Clean up on skin, bathroom surfaces, and clothes is super easy with hot water.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of the reviews stating that they had minimal redness, easy clean-up and good results.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of the reviews stating that they had minimal redness, easy clean-up and good results.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>, this wax is most effective on hair that has grown off for some-time, not newly shaved or plucked-off hair.     </li>
            <li>Take it easy on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to remove in the shower and comes off with just hot water.</li>
            <li>My first challenge was keeping the wax warm enough for me to be able to spread, which of course is a challenge for me anyways.</li>
            <li>Because I have such coarse hair, I was very sure waxing would hurt like hell even though I&#x27;m a good bearer of pain.</li>
            <li>this most recent session, I washed my face in warm water (to loosen up the pores and their grip on the hairs) and mild Dove soap first.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say this at the very end, but it can be easily missed as I just threw out my original batch of cloth.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions to detail, you will get great results with very minimal pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>There is less pain, it smells good, it isn&#x27;t as sticky and it is SUPER easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions on heating - substance is sticky but works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that the redness faded quickly after the hair removal.</li>
            <li>Not only was it easy, it was kind of fun.</li>
            <li>Nice work, Moom, and thanks so much for making this product so affordable as well.</li>
            <li>- 100% ORGANIC, Reusable Muslin cloths, convenient wooden spatulas, leaves skin silky smooth, no irritation, can be used warm or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>And I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy more cloth strips, but can actually wash/re-use them!</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, and that everything needed is included, and the price is fantastic, but it does take a while to learn how to use correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I wish I would have ordered more then just 6 oz and more strips just not enough for my hairy legs.</li>
            <li>and then I realized why the directions said to do it quickly.</li>
            <li>It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice.</li>
            <li>am a white female with semi-coarse leg hair, so maybe its best for people with thinner leg hair.</li>
            <li>I can proudly say that, thanks to Moom, I will finally get to experience all the benefits that long-term, dedicated waxing can bring.</li>
            <li>With this wax the redness wears off quickly and no breakouts afterwards.</li>
            <li>Nads is SUPER sticky- even when you heat it up.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to spend extra money buying more and more strips.</li>
            <li>I bought 50 extra strips which I&#x27;m glad I bought as I&#x27;ll need more for legs and under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>OK so first off, this is my first time ever waxing or sugar waxing.</li>
            <li>The jar of wax included in this kit has lasted me: 2 brazillians, 1 lip, 1 toes/feet, and 3 pregnant belly waxings.</li>
            <li>Results are quick, and</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, it is super-effective and VERY easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its so much easier to clean anddd!</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, heats up fast, goes on easy</li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap, it was hard not to give it a try after so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is a little sticky and can be diffcult because it is better used when its very warm and doesnt stay warm for very long</li>
            <li>What I like the most about this is that it is such easy clean up when you are finished</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very pleased with the results on my upper lip</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is a good choice, though if you have a low pain tolerance this is slightly better than wax choices, still get a numbing creme too.</li>
            <li>It is indeed a bit messy, but I found it the most effective when heated to a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>The English is clear, the procedures are easy, and there are tips to help you have a successful experience</li>
            <li>The wax also wipes off really well with some warm water, so it was easy to clean my body, hands, sticks, and strips for next time.</li>
            <li>Really - it smells like sweet honey!  </li>
            <li>There are recipes on how to make this stuff all over the Web; however, I&#x27;m thrilled with buying Moom instead of making my own sugar wax, even though I am usually a DIY-er.</li>
            <li>I spread the sugaring solution MUCH thinner than I ever would have thought to do on my own, and I reuse areas of the same strip (without adding more product) by pressing it back against my skin and rubbing quickly to warm it up, then cooling and removing again.  </li>
            <li>This Moom - was so much easier because it is easy to get off with water and reapply.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely aware of it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think id ever get the wax off &amp; that was using hot water &amp; soap!</li>
            <li>It really works for me!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting my face waxed for years and it was so embarrassing to go into a salon and have people point out how much hair they had pulled off of my face!!</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some time to perfect the technique, particularly if you have never waxed before, and it can get pretty messy, but the good news is that it is quite easy to clean up with water, and I found the result of all the hard work to be much more satisfying than shaving.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally lick your lips and get a bit of it in your system, it&#x27;s awesome to know that you aren&#x27;t ingesting noxious chemicals, but rather a fairly natural compound that will do less harm than eating a bite of a sugary dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were a soft muslin cloth and were easy to smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is for some reason the product did not work on my leg hair as well (like 30% effective at best), though my leg hair is fine and blonde, whereas my armpit and bikini hair is coarser and dark.  </li>
            <li>so it is very easy to clean up (although a bit messier initially).  </li>
            <li>It is easier to clean up, very easy, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Third, it was very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>- Clean up is so easy - just use hot water or a warm wet towel.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face, it took some of the fine hair off but not the really corsed ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried this product many ways, in microwave, room temp, clean skin, semi clean skin, short regrowth, suggested regrowth, etc...</li>
            <li>After a couple of practice strips I found this product to be easy to use, easy to clean up, and effecient (even on my stubborn asian hair).  </li>
            <li>for this product, i recently used it for eye brows and upper lip (both areas were fine hairs) but the wax was not that effective on the new short hairs that grew on the eyebrows (lol!)</li>
            <li>The little booklet with directions is great too.</li>
            <li>Came right off, some discomfort but overall many times easier than waxing!  </li>
            <li>I had basically resigned myself to the shaving method until recently I felt adventurous again and decided it would be nice to wax the rest of my body myself instead of getting it professionally</li>
            <li>This product works fabulously and is very well priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not that messy and the strips clean easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Great product just really messy</li>
            <li>Its a learning curve but its well worth it.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve gotten more than $200 of salon priced removal out of it, i dont mind if when i get towards the bottom of the jar i need to spend another $20 on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love natural products but this one just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Moom is by far better at removing hair than anything I&#x27;ve bought from the store.</li>
            <li>No irritation or chemical burns from the sugar, even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup...</li>
            <li>claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup...</li>
            <li>If you still see hairs, smooth on a bit more baby powder and the next strip will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am thrilled with this product for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to spread when it&#x27;s not heated, but it&#x27;s better to do &#x27;sweat spots&#x27; without heating it, or I&#x27;m sure you could use the powder suggested in the video</li>
            <li>This stuff just wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money for me, even if it did remove my hair.</li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s worth it because no stubby regrowth.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is nice.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural, too.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on Amazon even though I shop here all the time, but this product works.</li>
            <li>but i have to go over spots many times before hair is almost completely removed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can use some strips of natural undyed cotton in addition to the ones they give you, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li>I would say this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was actually fun to do this</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest trying to keep the protective seal handy</li>
            <li>I love how washable this is and how it leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>wow magic.........................</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth it for anyone to try.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the asking price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t immediately have success-</li>
            <li>But given the cost, I think in future I will reuse the Moom jar and supplies and just DIY my own sugar wax.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on the rate of regrowth, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied with the process and the results</li>
            <li>Underarms: 2 weeks worth of underarm hair.</li>
            <li>I was SURPRISED and PLEASED.    </li>
            <li>As it is advertised, it is all natural (and therefore healthier for your skin) and is easy to clean up as it is sugar based.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be ok on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it worked well and didn&#x27;t cause irritation like most wax does for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have someone you really want to see your most intimate parts, and that, for me is not going to happen..</li>
            <li>I love how this is not messy and it rinses off with water.</li>
            <li>I just wish she wouldn&#x27;t laugh at me as she does it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I actually like the cheap sugar waxing kit I bought at Walmart better.</li>
            <li>I tried spreading the product on the strip and it is easier to use, but when I applied directly on the skin it removed way better.</li>
            <li>I got such great results, and I&#x27;m probably more inexperienced at hair removal than most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>almost perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;The key to using Moom is to find your own &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34; with it.  </li>
            <li>either way, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money for getting my legs done.</li>
            <li>I feel more environmentally conscious than throwing away a bunch of strips with my hair on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the upside, however, I only had to shave 1 leg for about 3 weeks, which was nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, so I bought it and &#x27;hoped&#x27; it would work out for me to tidy up my brows and such between visits.</li>
            <li>You can hand me any kind of lotion for red bumps and mine will still be there.</li>
            <li>Bought this because my friend did and she had a lot of success with it.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money</li>
            <li>The hair removal is extremely effective when done properly.</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s natural products.</li>
            <li>I liked it and my next purchase will also be Moom Organic.</li>
            <li>but I always had to go back over it with another kind of wax.</li>
            <li>I first tried it on my arms, where the hair is much stronger then on the legs (which I used to shave or epilate) and I was amazed to see the hair being removed so easy.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that it smells and tastes good, and it is more natural than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The original applicators definitely do the job, but toothpicks allow for a bit more accuracy, and you can just discard them instead of washing at the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Middle Eastern originally, and have been using sugar wax most of my life to remove hair, however it&#x27;s always easier when someone does the waxing for you, as when you do it alone</li>
            <li>, I LOVE IT, EASY TO USE, BE CAREFUL IT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li>overall i&#x27;m very pleased with this product, especially because the hair comes out easier the more you use it.</li>
            <li>But here&#x27;s the good news, unlike other wax products this one does not hurt..  </li>
            <li>I had no problems using this kit and it is good if you want to be quick without leaving a mess.</li>
            <li>so it washes right off.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and could tell right away that the product worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li>(the water takes the wax right off)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>you can buy a beard/bikini trimmer to uniformly trim the hair to the right length.  </li>
            <li>right before pulling it off - this helps with adhesion  </li>
            <li>I used this product on my right leg</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not using it right or something.</li>
            <li>I heated the product over the stove and had an issue getting everything to the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>Have whomever is doing it read and UNDERSTAND all the directions before they start, and remember if it doesn&#x27;t hurt they&#x27;re not doing it right.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>maybe i did not do it right</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t use the right technique you can break the hair off rather than remove it from the root.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions over and over and did it the right way...</li>
            <li>(mine were...originally) it does rip the scab right off.</li>
            <li>took me awhile to get it right</li>
            <li>Washed right off and doesn&#x27;t remove any skin layers...</li>
            <li>it washed right off with just water.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it until the consistency is right (like honey) so that you can spread it out.</li>
            <li>This stuff hurts, unless I&#x27;m not pulling it right.</li>
            <li>I had never waxed before and wanted to get the right product for me.</li>
            <li>but it really does come off clean.</li>
            <li>Clean up is much MUCH quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li>MOOM is relatively cost effective because the spatulas and strips are reusable (just wash them with hot water).</li>
            <li>It works perfect for my dark, coarse hair on my bikini area.</li>
            <li>This kit is not as much effective as a regular wax, but it is SOOOO much nicer to use it!</li>
            <li>I learned that I would probably have been better off leaving it to a professional, being that this was the first time I&#x27;ve waxed</li>
            <li>so it is much much much easier to clean up than wax.</li>
            <li>I am going to put it in a bowl of hot water next time to try keeping it warm</li>
            <li>I will not buy again, but I looked online and this stuff is actually very easy to make yourself with simple household ingredients.</li>
            <li>Second, it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First off, when I first got this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get much hair off though, I think the strips are good only for the bikini line, underarm, or facial hair</li>
            <li>Not only did it deliver effective results on \\&quot;all\\&quot; areas of my body, but once I got the hang of using the product, my skin was left smooth, hairless, and pain free.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to make a lot more for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for smooth and easy waxing</li>
            <li>carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to take the fine hair off my upper lip, and my fine chin hair, some peach-fuzz across the sides of my face, and define my eyebrow line.</li>
            <li>After four uses total, we still have half a jar of wax and the washed strips hold up perfectly.</li>
            <li>It ultimately removed about half the hairs, at best.</li>
            <li>A six or seven dollar box of wax strips would last a month or two if I was lucky, so this is a much better bargain.</li>
            <li>I had tried the Parissa before, and while it was okay, my hair grew back quickly.</li>
            <li>Even though the directions say to apply the MOOM in the direction of the hair growth and pull the muslin strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth, I found it&#x27;s more effective if I MOOM several times in both directions.</li>
            <li>, I went online to watch the instructional video, and saw that I should maybe use a bit more MOOM than the barely visible layer I has been applying.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve raised the price on this product since I first bought it, but I think it&#x27;s still worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to be hair free for a few weeks whilst on my jollies and the good reviews convinced me to give it a go.</li>
            <li>This kit is so professional: everything is neat and tidy, no mess for me, stores neatly, beautifully packaged, and enough sugar wax and strips to last me for years.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try if your hair is fine maybe and your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not painful like normal wax!</li>
            <li>The first time I did this, it took about an hour to get it right.</li>
            <li>really love the fact that it washes right off with warm water, the cloth strips are re-usable, and this product seems to last for a really long time.  </li>
            <li>I figured Moom would be no different, but decided to buy it because I was looking for a natural product and there were such great reviews (no pain, easy clean-up, etc.).</li>
            <li>Waxing does hurt, but not THAT bad, and this is for sure the best way to go.</li>
            <li>This barely hurts and the organic stuff actually smells nice!  </li>
            <li>i have never done waxing by myself at all - but this product was easy on the skin, the wax need only medium warming (no need to really heat), and the wax is easy to wash-off, it comes with cloth-strips that are washable for re-use.    </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while it has \\&quot;tee tree\\&quot; in it, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily and completely natural.</li>
            <li>This wax was also easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It heated in no time, went on easy and was nearly painless.  </li>
            <li>Great products will defintely come back here again in the future and i recommend this products.</li>
            <li>Loved the fact that it is natural just wish it actually worked.</li>
            <li>So I very recently in my adult life learned how easy it is to wax at home.</li>
            <li>In fact it leaves my face silky smooth and very soft, and I&#x27;m already finding the grow-back time to be lengthening.  </li>
            <li>Now, though, it&#x27;s simple, quick, and clean!</li>
            <li>you are someone who is experienced with wax it doesn&#x27;t mean you are going to have a 100% success with Moom, you have to adjust to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although today, my left leg (the waxed leg) is more tender than the right</li>
            <li>First time, right out of the jar - worked like a charm, removed hair exactly as is should.  </li>
            <li>I either run everything under hot water or let it sit in a pot of hot water for a bit, and it all washes right</li>
            <li>I was also a bit concerned, this being my first time, and I&#x27;ve never even been professionally waxed, but I found the instructions to be very adequate and the process simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does remove your facial hair just fine with no skin attached!    </li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>and my skin is very smooth, no red spots or any hair...</li>
            <li>I very much prefer the cocojo sugar wax.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burning feeling.</li>
            <li>Although it was very fast shipping..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great tip to heed is to make sure you are applying a very thin layer to your skin,</li>
            <li>The toothpicks were just the size I needed to direct the sugar over my fine eyebrow hairs.     </li>
            <li>This product, however-- was easy, not messy, and my under arms are smooth and clear looking.</li>
            <li>This is the first hair removal kit I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my legs and other areas, great for sensitive areas but in my opinion, NOT FOR A BRAZILIAN WAX.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very pleased, but like other people said it doesn&#x27;t get out all the hair on the first time</li>
            <li>Great organic wax that somehow doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other waxes, even professional waxes.</li>
            <li>I simply fill my sink up with warm water and stick the strips in as I&#x27;m done using them, along with the wooden applicators, and ALL the wax dissolves easily.</li>
            <li>When you are wearing work shoes and uniforms for a good portion of your day, every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li>by the third time the hair comes out really easily and the pain level is non-existent to mild, depending on the area.</li>
            <li>got none of the fuzz on my face, which I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about because they are pretty fine.</li>
            <li>It is indeed very gentle on skin, and putting the product on hot in...</li>
            <li>However, I watched the video and did it EXACTLY as the directions in the box said, so I&#x27;m positive I was doing it right.    </li>
            <li>I nuked it according to instructions and still too hot.</li>
            <li>I had no idea what exactly this was.</li>
            <li>My first time using this product on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>It cleans most of the area up well leaving you to pluck the smaller hairs.    </li>
            <li>I am 100% female :)</li>
            <li>I threw the jar out after the first attempt.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up with soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using a loofa to make sure when the hair starts coming back that it doesn&#x27;t grow under the skin.  </li>
            <li>Most women have tried various hair removal products over the years.</li>
            <li>have to say this product does EXACTLY what it says.</li>
            <li>I decided to be REALLY ambitious and try my bikini area...</li>
            <li>I am sure once I can actually see my feet...</li>
            <li>I am sure once I can actually see my feet...</li>
            <li>and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and</li>
            <li>and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and</li>
            <li>(Of course, there could be some operator error causing the &amp;#34;not pefectness.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I will try on my legs next to see if I have better results.</li>
            <li>My biggest concerns about waxing were about being able to rip the strips off properly, the bruising and the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This being my first time, I figured out not to do that again</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after the first time.</li>
            <li>I will say that I had to go over some areas multiple times to get all the hair, but I attribute this to my inexperience, and I found that areas of finer hair yielded more.</li>
            <li>and so I tried this at home first.</li>
            <li>did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to hold the skin as taut as possible.  </li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s got that holistic, natural thing going on if that&#x27;s important to you.  </li>
            <li>But I guess after the first time I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fill up the bottom of the tub (or sink) with hot water and place the strips in them immediately after use</li>
            <li>if only more strips came with it though.</li>
            <li>The only downside is you have to make sure you get the strip well attached first, because if not when you rip it off it doesn&#x27;t always work.    </li>
            <li>This is definitely easier than DIY sugar waxing but isn&#x27;t any better than a razor or epilator in my opinion.</li>
            <li>i also used this on my face and legs and never had any sort of pain, even the first time.     </li>
            <li>They still work 100% as well as the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>I then moved to more coarse hairs</li>
            <li>I like the cruelty-free ingredients -- in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they have a video, because I&#x27;m a total noob when it comes to removing hair except on my face and neck by razor.</li>
            <li>This wax really does wash off!</li>
            <li>It works (even the first time I tried it and didn&#x27;t know what I was doing).</li>
            <li>It even works on underarms pretty well.</li>
            <li>In short, I love this wax</li>
            <li>and tips to first time waxers:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was only able to use the product on one leg, both underarms, and the neck/chin area.  </li>
            <li>You will need more strips and Moom if you intend to do your entire body at once.  </li>
            <li>I believe Moom will work for some, but not all, so I wanted to give some tips to first time users so they would have the advantages that I did not.  </li>
            <li>If the Moom is too hot, it will burn you.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it dosent hurt or leave my skin all red.</li>
            <li>Removing the lid liner the first time was the trickiest part.</li>
            <li>Exactly as reviewers stated it will be.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wash first as instructed.</li>
            <li>And after a couple of sessions here and there, and much experience generally with sugar wax, I can say this is my favorite way to use this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them all, and this Moom product is the first one that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash or whiteheads to form on my face.  </li>
            <li>Tried different strips, and found that the paper disposable ones work better than the cloth ones provided.  </li>
            <li>No weird smells.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this by also saying that this was my first time ever waxing at home with a DIY kit.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be tempted to just use more on the popsicle stick so you can spread larger areas, but you cant do that because the jar is really tiny, and you&#x27;ll go through it REAL quick.</li>
            <li>will definitely be ordering a couple more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried to put it in hot water and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not supposed to be hot or runny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty convenient that you can just wash the wax off and reuse them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didnt spread smoothly when heated and didnt remove anywhere near all hair.  </li>
            <li>First, for everyone complaining about the amount of product, please note that they also sell this in a 12 oz.</li>
            <li>The pain was minimal, and everything washed up with warm water.</li>
            <li>The only wish I had for this product is that there were more application cloths included.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the Moom kit</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the directions state to microwave it first</li>
            <li>(but it gets toooo hot for me)..</li>
            <li>First of all, I am a guy.  </li>
            <li>I have my back waxed by a professional, which makes me much more comfortable in a uniform shirt on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I had waxed my legs.  </li>
            <li>I just tried Moom for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a better way to deal with upper lip hair for a while.</li>
            <li>I opened the instructions and read them, and used the product exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>All in all, I really really couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>I usually make my own sugar wax anymore because it&#x27;s basically free and works just as well.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Moom</li>
            <li>Two weeks after my first Moom-ing</li>
            <li>Well the first time I shaved was when I was twelve and then by fifteen</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want it to get hot like a wax</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to follow up this review, I already ordered a larger size of moom!</li>
            <li>I tried hot wax</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of leg wax in my quest to never shave ever again -</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Gets oily if used in same spot more than twice&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been waxed before and this was a first time experience that I actually enjoyed, if that is possible with hair removal.</li>
            <li>applied the wax to the cloth first and then placed on skin taking note the direction of hair before putting the cloth on my skin.</li>
            <li>All reusable things too which is fabulous and not to mention no harsh</li>
            <li>tried it the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Smooth skin after all these years and using natural, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it since January and at first I used it once a week</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m pretty flexible).  </li>
            <li>I love this wax and would recommend it for facial use.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned, so I am always dealing with razor burn and skin irritation.</li>
            <li>My first time ever sugaring...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have more control over smaller strips but the process will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;--Use</li>
            <li>Once I finish the tub, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase the Moom refills since the muslin strips and popsicle sticks are reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was my first time waxing my body.  </li>
            <li>It needs a higher temperature to reach a spreadable state.</li>
            <li>First time waxer, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>First attempt: Legs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit and since then have also ordered more removal strips and several of the the 12 oz size hair remover.  </li>
            <li>First, this is NOT wax.  </li>
            <li>Especially considering that the top layer of the skin has also been removed.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too hot for my underarms to bear.</li>
            <li>This was my first time self waxing</li>
            <li>And it never gets the hair the first time.</li>
            <li>If its your first time waxing or using this product, use numbing cream.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they let the product get too hot</li>
            <li>And, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you may have patchy legs the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>a first time waxer i had no idea.</li>
            <li>I didnt get the wax off the first time with the strip</li>
            <li>so I purchased this as my first self waxing kit</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time because (for some reason) ULTA that is in my area didn&#x27;t have an epilator.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly how the package told me to</li>
            <li>I definitely will recommend this to friends and will be buying more of the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; when I run out.</li>
            <li>somethings are better left</li>
            <li>This is the first waxing product I ever bough,vand also the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried waxing.</li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t need to be hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend heating it in a hot water.</li>
            <li>BUT this was my first time waxing my legs</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a extra strength wax, some hair can be more stubborn than others.</li>
            <li>First time waxing and</li>
            <li>but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me.</li>
            <li>In order to spread this sugar (thats all it is), it must be sufficiently hot, but of course that ends up burning your skin.</li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s has better quality cotton strips and it is not necessary to heat in order to spread the product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Nad&#x27;s since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>This took off all of the hair, first try.</li>
            <li>, I did once on my first batch</li>
            <li>I use a wooden cuticle pusher to apply the wax because this works better than the sticks provided with the Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use as much product to get the job done either!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with anything like waxing.</li>
            <li>I did not expect that much pain!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure it will last longer for others.</li>
            <li>I think I just liked the name and color, and I was just curious also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also pleased with Moom&#x27;s facial hair remover kit.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I did not follow the instructions and no hair was removed -</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at first, don&#x27;t try over and over again (like I did the first time with stubblies).</li>
            <li>I have tried it so many times, following instructions to the tee.</li>
            <li>Rub in the direction of the hair to make sure it covers it all, then pull in the opposite direction to take the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I microwaved it, and although it didn&#x27;t seem hot, it was</li>
            <li>I had to go back over some spots, which caused more pain.</li>
            <li>I am a first timer and</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to professionals or first time users.</li>
            <li>Just run it under hot water for a while.</li>
            <li>it first attaches to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used (attempted to use) this product several times, each time hoping the amount of hair that would be removed would be greater.  </li>
            <li>i should have probably done a test area first.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>So the following week I decided to try it again now that I had a bit more experience under my belt.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>I first used Moom</li>
            <li>so it was more spreadable, but let it go back to room temperature.</li>
            <li>But after following the directions EXACTLY, I still could not get more than a couple of hairs removed.</li>
            <li>20 seconds is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I really like the product ~!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a waxing product</li>
            <li>It did not remove most of the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly, and just got so so results.</li>
            <li>I applied it and as I was removing the first strip, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li>If you can leave the normal waxing rules behind and just follow the directions, you will be very happy!</li>
            <li>I wanted to remove facial hair mostly under my chin.</li>
            <li>and I think if you are lucky enough to have blond baby hair to get rid of, this would work fine.</li>
            <li>ITS MY FIRST TIME WAXING</li>
            <li>, I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li>Personally I feel like it&#x27;s a hassle to keep making sure</li>
            <li>First time waxer, I bought this for use on my lower legs and underarms before a vacation.</li>
            <li>I washed them exactly how the instructions say to</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than the Nads wax strips I had used before (it actually removes the hair).</li>
            <li>all good stuff,but messy.</li>
            <li>read a few good reviews and decided to try MOOM.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have a high pain tolerance from years of waxing and getting piercings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly a brilliant product - it washes off the strips (reusable) and off your face so easily with cold water.</li>
            <li>and I am 7 months pregnant with my 4th, so not only could I not not get too comfortable lifting my leg to wax it</li>
            <li>It was very effective for me, comparable to the result I get from using hard wax.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about this product and will definitely be saving a lot of money now!</li>
            <li>among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more.</li>
            <li>among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more.</li>
            <li>Also, I love how naturally pleasing it smells and how it is completely natural and organic!</li>
            <li>Product was sticky and fairly messy, It didn&#x27;t apply smoothly because I don&#x27;t believe it was warm enough even though I followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, it make work for you or you may prefer shaving and waxing once you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>I also liked the tissue and other stuffs coming with it.</li>
            <li>can be used several more times (if there wasn&#x27;t too much hair after the first rip)</li>
            <li>I read reviews about other people saying to warm it up</li>
            <li>I normally used the Very prewaxed strips, but in efforts to go more natural and use non toxic ingredients I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it was my first time really doing it successfully, I did it in small sections at a time</li>
            <li>My upper lip is a little bit tender, but I loved how easy it was to wash off the remaining product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to burn youself if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li>I did the sides fairly well and the top of the bikini area was the most difficult mainly due to my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>I also love the reusable cloth strips which rinse right off with hot water and dry relatively fast for reuse.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use, it cleaned up easy, didn&#x27;t pull off any of my skin, and hurt surprisingly less than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and just use a warm wet wash cloth when using to wipe off skin or spills.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is pretty fine, and I get the impression that this stuff actually works better on coarse hair.    </li>
            <li>I used my tweezers to pluck a few hairs that I missed and my legs are smooth and hair free!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say you can make this stuff work if you REALLY want to, but you&#x27;re going to have to get a couple of jars or a larger jar of the stuff if you want to do more than one leg.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t really work for my armpits, but I think that was more my inexperience than it was anything to do with the product.</li>
            <li>This is far better than waxing-unless you go to a professional.</li>
            <li>Spreads smooth and the cloth strips stick better than the heavy paper ones.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m even near my time of the month which should make my bikini area all the more sensitive.</li>
            <li>however i had to apply the Moom several times on my upper lip for it to remove a good amount of hair  </li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s this difficult for SO many people to do it, then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and when I saw that this product only grabs the hairs, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I am very fair skinned, I bruise very easily, and I have very thick dark hair.</li>
            <li>They recommended first doing it with a certain length</li>
            <li>: Left about 5% of the hairs- mostly just ones that were too short or fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d caution anyone who uses it that LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li>If I can use it anyone can, you may need to practice a bit, but it is worth it, great results and it only needs to be warmed a little so no worries about burns.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any positive experiences with homemade wax, so I will continue buying Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been buying cheaper products regularly (the Sally Hansen hair remover wax strip kit or microwavable facial wax), but I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to spend more and try something new.  </li>
            <li>The wax is water soluble so a little bit of water is all you need to clean up excess wax on your body, any wax that dripped on the counter top or floor ,etc...  4)</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really have the hang of pulling the strips and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have waxed pretty much my whole body (arms, legs, underarms, eyebrows)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, takes the hair away for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every DIY wax out there...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s economical, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s empowering, and it&#x27;s even quite a bit of fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fast with my waxing</li>
            <li>Havent tried a whole lot of waxing products but this stuff seems pretty legit.</li>
            <li>I bought it for bikini waxing but found out you can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous when I took the first pull</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing to pull out those hairs, after being applied exactly as per directions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely painless, but a million times better than the wax strips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my legs and underarms, just be sure your hair isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li>first time I tried it I overzealously microwaved the wax too much</li>
            <li>If you wanted to cut your own strips out of a soft, cotton muslin, which I don&#x27;t, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still a good product, but unless they change the type of fabric strips they send with the product, I can no longer recommend it - which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li>it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair, probably medium course-ness and while Moom does pull some of the hair out, it&#x27;s just not as effective as wax and it takes a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>but I think I read the more you do it, the less quickly regrowth will occur.</li>
            <li>I was super pleased that I was hair less.</li>
            <li>As a man, I&#x27;ve been shaving the twig and berries for years, twice a week, to keep everything neat and tidy down there.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and very sensitive to A LOT of ingredients in typical OTC products.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly in the microwave and stays at a nice consistency long enough for you to finish waxing.</li>
            <li>smaller sticks made it very easy to create a fairly precise line in the arch of my brows without worrying about accidents, something that is fairly easy to screw up and in my opinion is what brow pencils were made to hide (at least when I do them).</li>
            <li>the instructions were simple, the wax was easy to apply without being too hot, and cleanup was a snap - just a little warm water.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use that I will definitely do this over shaving or anything else from now on.</li>
            <li>They have some very helpful educational information and a video tutorial which I found very helpful.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I&#x27;m on blood thinners, so I bruise easy.</li>
            <li>This was easily solved by having a damp wash cloth next to me.</li>
            <li>If you miss some hairs, it&#x27;s easy to go over the same spot again without making it sore.</li>
            <li>If the included fabric strips wear out, I can go to the fabric store, buy a yard of muslin fabric for less than $2, and make my own with a pair of scissors, I figure.    </li>
            <li>and I used wax on my left to easily compare the two.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is lotion-free and completely dry before beginning&lt;</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, and being that its all-natural, clean-up is simple and easy.</li>
            <li>Great for small sensitive areas like bikini.</li>
            <li>, I love that the strips are reusable - you just need to soak them in water and then leave them out to dry.</li>
            <li>Just be sure that your skin is dry or the wax will not adhere to your hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use, all you need is place  the jar into the oven for 10 second, then apply on your skin and wax!!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my legs super duper soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tweezers before, but I really couldn&#x27;t do much &#x27;cause it&#x27;d sting so much my eyes would water, but this stuff was not the case!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it unheated, slightly heated, and warm.  </li>
            <li>but the process is simple and easy to do.</li>
            <li>favorite part of these is that you just need to wash the strips in water and you can reuse them again once they&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and will definitely be buying a bigger jar.</li>
            <li>but I was not sure about the face as my eyes were watering too much for a good look.  </li>
            <li>I had to slowly peel the wax off one hair at a time it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>I was also using the large strips.</li>
            <li>Regardless, you are pulling large quantities of hair out by the root which is attached to blood vessels and pain receptor cells</li>
            <li>My issue is with the large fabric strips in the kit I received from Vitacost.  </li>
            <li>I then placed the jar in a large mug of boiling water</li>
            <li>The application sticks did not help, as they take large bits, and clumps to whichever hair</li>
            <li>I expect I will be using less next time, as I found that I didn&#x27;t need to spread more product on each time, but just put the strip with some wax already on it onto the next section, rub it to warm the product, wait a moment for it to cool, and then rip again and repeat until it wasn&#x27;t sticky enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is nice in that you don&#x27;t HAVE to heat it up, but there have been times during colder months that I find it&#x27;s more solid than usual.</li>
            <li>Then I read about this product, and when I saw only 4 completely natural organic ingredients on it, it was love at first sight.</li>
            <li>Even though I only got to use half of the container, I still felt that I got great value for my money and have reordered.</li>
            <li>If you let the wax warm up too much, it&#x27;ll pull less hair out.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done waxing I screw the lid on nice and tight and rinse any wax on the bottle off.  </li>
            <li>Washes off quickly, with no mess at all.</li>
            <li>It appeared to work much better on the course, longer hair and less effective on the finer, shorter hairs as expected.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not see any improvement as I have to tweeze significantly after that initial use.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the end results but they were such a mess</li>
            <li>I do dread the idea of spending the time doing large areas like my whole leg.</li>
            <li>I love that it is sensitive enough for my face, but it&#x27;s strong enough to use on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>Leaving it on the warmer keeps it at just the right consistency) and cut the longer strips in half so that I have more pieces to use in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your room temperature is a little on the warm side, you won&#x27;t have to heat this up.</li>
            <li>When I searched prices for waxing in saloons they all ranged pretty high.</li>
            <li>All great results - again, not perfect, but pretty close!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very easy, much easier than ripping your pubes out with your bare hands like I have been doing for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li>for removing any extra product from the skin, I found out that using Witch Hazel works really well for cleaning off residue off the skin leaving a smooth, unsticky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>It was not great for really course hair like on the underarms but worked great on legs and bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I then used masking tape to tape my shoulder and forarms back to make the skin taunt, then I warmed it like suggested to a honey consistency and applied it real light, then I pulled it in the opposite direction of my skin growth.</li>
            <li>I tried a few different times, but I still wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Really like that fabric strips are reusable.</li>
            <li>And the redness went away amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li>Also my hair is very course</li>
            <li>With much saddness I must say that this product did not work.</li>
            <li>What really attracted me to this product were the reviews, and now I can confirm that if you are used to going to a salon</li>
            <li>, I really can&#x27;t think of anything else.    </li>
            <li>I would have worn myself out too much to finish.</li>
            <li>Overall I think its a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using it, I was very displeased.</li>
            <li>It works really well also.</li>
            <li>It works really well for removing hair also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gosh darned frustrating when I order a product with great reviews....</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>The only additional purchase I made was a pack of toothpicks, which I use to smooth the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a real plus-</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than going somewhere to get waxed.</li>
            <li>and I may very well be a convert</li>
            <li>All you really need to buy is some strips, tongue depressors and a jar.</li>
            <li>It went much smoother when I started doing this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with</li>
            <li>I used it once on each under arm but discarded too much work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to really work well at all.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t brake out as much.</li>
            <li>By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom.  </li>
            <li>By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom.  </li>
            <li>I also found out that you really have to apply it paper-thin, because if it&#x27;s anything thicker, it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair.</li>
            <li>The Moom really stuck to it</li>
            <li>Doesnt work really well but helps with hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It works really well on the hairs of my arm pits and face.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; was very sticky but it did work at removing the hair from my arms.</li>
            <li>But I was fed up of spending so much money on getting waxed</li>
            <li>this product removes hair without pain and is gentle.</li>
            <li>However, epilating my thighs hurt so much, I decided to wax them, and just keep epilating my lower legs.    </li>
            <li>I also have my doubts that this stuff is really pulling it out at the root.    </li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions and it just didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like wasting that much money again</li>
            <li>I followed directions very closely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving the same star rating because the wait for smooth skin with this product is a bit</li>
            <li>I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>VERY sticky&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some websites I had visited stated that this was the correct way to do sugaring, and MOOM is really just a form of sugaring.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t make a mistake with this product.  </li>
            <li>yes it really, really works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky, so get ready to wash your hands a lot.  </li>
            <li>Also, the instructions say to be careful not overheat - this is important!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have that much body hair to remove and</li>
            <li>It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else.</li>
            <li>If you read the instructions carefully, and follow what they say, this product removes hair the fastest and most</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can get a tad sticky, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with it getting everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Nad&#x27;s for my feet, and never had any real issue with it, but I was just looking to try something</li>
            <li>It is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for having to let my hair grow out so long,but I figured you had to do that with any wax.  </li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t work, unless you want to become a Gulag torture</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet was really helpful as well.</li>
            <li>Left me smooth with zero irritation.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those disposable strips.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest Moom if you&#x27;re looking for an at-home wax!</li>
            <li>The hydrophobic qualities of this product WILL NOT ADHERE PROPERLY IF NOT APPLIED TO A CLEAN, DRY, OIL AND MAKEUP FREE AREA!</li>
            <li>I dabbed until the sugar wax seeped through the cloth (really grab to the hair)</li>
            <li>the process is a whole lot easier than I was anticipating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I just use extra light olive oil for face and body.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get too sticky or cold, but the liquid-y texture makes the best results I think.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure the area is clean and dry and only put a paper-thin amount on the area.  </li>
            <li>This sugaring still hurt, but didn&#x27;t seem to hurt quite as much.</li>
            <li>that was very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I admit I have very well-muscled calves, so YMMV.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it just sounded like too much work.  </li>
            <li>beginners may find it difficult to spread the sugar (unless experienced and expert at waxing) initially, but I think with practice it will get better</li>
            <li>I just used this and already the redness (pinkness) is fading, and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.</li>
            <li>if this stuff is made from sugar and lemon juice, how much could i screw up if I did it myself.  </li>
            <li>Have your area ready - lay out some paper towels or anything to catch sticky drips</li>
            <li>If the jar can be used to the very end, I won&#x27;t have to go to the spa for waxing for about 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>You will probably need a warmer because it solidifies so fast.</li>
            <li>Using an epilator took too much time.</li>
            <li>Th hair does grow back in light.</li>
            <li>but I had to go over several spots twice to get all of it for a really smooth look.</li>
            <li>I have been using epilation and it is much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>, i really like how its water-soluble.  </li>
            <li>all hairs were removed in one go with skin left smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After READING THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY THOROUGHLY, I began.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like this product and the results I got from it.</li>
            <li>The cloth strips are reusable, so you&#x27;re really getting your value out of this product.</li>
            <li>I always get bumps and fast regrowth after shaving</li>
            <li>Unfortunate, because this seemed like such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love my Parissa strips [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it takes too much time to wax compared to shaving either.</li>
            <li>GOT REALLY</li>
            <li>Stick to real wax and skip the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; marketing hype.</li>
            <li>and I take ao much time to do so.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky, but even when I use the Very strips I always get some wax on my hands anyway.</li>
            <li>The strips are said to be reusable but mine didn&#x27;t do very well in the wash</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think that they really would.</li>
            <li>Works much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it really only kept me smooth for about 4 days.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like the strips it comes with.</li>
            <li>But my hair grows extremly fast.</li>
            <li>For having not waxed in over 5 years, it didn&#x27;t even hurt that much</li>
            <li>Very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole container in my &amp;#34;girlstache&amp;#34; and part of my legs (up to the knees).</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really pull all of the hair out.</li>
            <li>but without the negatives- it really does wash off with water, and</li>
            <li>(You can add a couple drops of tea tree oil and chamomile but don&#x27;t really notice a difference.)</li>
            <li>This stuff cools fast</li>
            <li>I was spending $25-30 every month for a very conservative bikini wax.</li>
            <li>It works very well if directions are followed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even sting as much as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that one part of my leg is really itchy and it hurts whenever I get goosebumps.</li>
            <li>It was really dissapointing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comparable to waxing.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I really like it-</li>
            <li>No section came out completely smooth, and it took almost the entire jar to do the lower part of my legs.</li>
            <li>I also tried this on my face and it didn&#x27;t give me rashes like the others and didn&#x27;t pain much.</li>
            <li>and yet I couldn&#x27;t keep the product warm enough to spread easily enough.</li>
            <li>Of course you don&#x27;t care what it tastes like, but when you&#x27;re spreading a product directly under your nose, it is important that it is made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a more natural wax, and threw out my Veet wax strips because of the BHA and red dye content.</li>
            <li>(You don&#x27;t want the stuff to be too warm though, it needs to be solid and sticky enough to pull the hairs out.)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used multiple products and i love that the strips are reusable and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>Another thing that I use is my old Nads applicator stick, it is angled and works better than the wooden stick for the bikini line.</li>
            <li>I finally tried the microwave and found one minute to be too hot and 20 seconds too cool for me.  </li>
            <li>Never having used such a product before I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and love  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth from no hair; no little bumps all over the chin area like shaving leaves; I suppose because the hair is still so close to the surface; my skin also feels moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>You have to apply a VERY thin layer of wax, or else it won&#x27;t be very effective, and you&#x27;ll quickly run out of wax.</li>
            <li>If you do it carefully, warming the wax to the right consistency, working in approximately 1x1 squares and pulling with confidence, it&#x27;s totally great!    </li>
            <li>Moom removed the long hairs on my legs perfectly but left the ones that were a millimeter or less.</li>
            <li>* if you&#x27;re using this product on your bikini area and you&#x27;ve never waxed before, expect some mild to moderate pain the first time.</li>
            <li>The area has not grown back as quickly as the first two times.</li>
            <li>But as a waxing product goes its been pretty gentle and makes my skin very soft after waxing.</li>
            <li>Especially that there are some good reviews to this product which makes me think that if it works for some other people it still may work for me.</li>
            <li>This wax is really easy to use, especially for quick facial hair removal.</li>
            <li>Also the ingredients in this wax are much more gentle on my face than other waxes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy on and easy off causing me hardly any pain.  </li>
            <li>I used most of this pretty fast, there isn&#x27;t enough to do your entire legs, but maybe one.</li>
            <li>The wax itself spreads much more easily than other brands and does not need to be heated as long.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful being able to do a quick hair removal as soon as I notice some extra hairs instead of waiting until the problem is bad enough to justify a trip to the salon.    </li>
            <li>you want natural results that keep your skin clean and exfoliated at thesame time while waxing, then go all natural and go with Moom.</li>
            <li>The instructions are a little different than other self waxing kits and i found it worked best when you follow it exactly.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s sure a lot cheaper than paying someone to do the job for me every other week.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like that the sugar washes off with water instead of needing an oil to remove it, because I don&#x27;t normally buy baby oil,  or have a bottle of that blue stuff that comes with wax available.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my lip, a little tricky on the eyebrows but probably cause the hairs aren&#x27;t as long</li>
            <li>no more spending $100 a month or more on waxing!</li>
            <li>The normal bumps and leg redness went away fast overnight and left me with smooth skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better than the other wax i was using before.</li>
            <li>;D Everything I Moomed, afterwards was baby soft!</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman who has only heard about waxing...and the first to admit there is a huge learning curve involved with usage of this product.  </li>
            <li>We tried it about a dozen times to make sure is wasn&#x27;t due to user error.</li>
            <li>- Very very sticky which has the potential to be messy, and not exactly the greatest on courser hair</li>
            <li>I will have to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back, but right now I think this is fantastic!</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a product that is simple to use and that does exactly what it says then this is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>You would then need to clean up the strips so that you could have enough strips to do another body part.  </li>
            <li>that was my first reaction, until I made myself try it a few more times.</li>
            <li>If you have Asian or fine hair, you will most likely have the same results that I did.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very simple to clean</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the first couple of times it worked great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and clean, just follow directions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s quite as powerful as normal wax, and how the time/moom cost compares to the cost of a professional wax job.</li>
            <li>- I think we all have realistic expectations here), but the difference with sugar solutions like this is that after you pull the first strip and most of the hair is removed, the second strip only grabs the remaining hair, not the skin.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it as I would much rather prefer to use a product with less chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a sting, but it doesn&#x27;t linger like the hard wax does and the skin is smooth right away, with the redness disappearing quickly.    </li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and not at all messy.  </li>
            <li>In more sensitive areas (testicles, for instance), you&#x27;ll want to spread the testicle skin as far to one side as you can and rip the other direction quickly.</li>
            <li>With that said, I&#x27;m most familiar with waxing, having done so for the past 15 years, both professionally and at home.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can reuse the wooden applicators and then just run them under hot water and the remaining wax comes right off.</li>
            <li>With the Moom, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly at all, and the Moom is much gentler on my face.</li>
            <li>and I quickly got the hang of it so that the second leg was much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely water soluble, is easy to use and is entirely organic</li>
            <li>The strips clean easily with water and wash ASAP after use and let dry flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past five years, and I refuse to try anything else because of how amazing it</li>
            <li>then most people might, even still, if I used this same amount again, it looks like I would have at least four more leg waxings.</li>
            <li>legs feel silky soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>that said, I&#x27;m using it on a pretty sensitive area.</li>
            <li>In the starter kit there is not enough Moom or strips to do a really good job on your entire body, especially if you decide that you want to do both legs.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for 15 minutes and the honey was so hot that I nearly burned</li>
            <li>I usually get my brows done at my sisters salon, but I decided to buy my own</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever waxed my armpits so they&#x27;re sensitive</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the one and two star reviews that are actually helpful and TRUE.</li>
            <li>Of course test this on your skin first - if you&#x27;re sensitive to heat</li>
            <li>This is the first time I wax and saw that this product was all natural, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin is pretty sensitive too</li>
            <li>The product works as well as you can expect it to if you&#x27;re doing it at home for the first time you&#x27;re not going to get professional results</li>
            <li>Not bad but still didn&#x27;t get all the hair and left wax on my skin that was NOT coming off.  </li>
            <li>It warmed up and spread fine, however it didn&#x27;t pull a single hair from my leg.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and have fairly fine, soft hair.</li>
            <li>Place a fabric strip over the area and rub up and down with your palm a couple times to make sure all the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is in contact with the strip.</li>
            <li>Be sure to brush on the wax with the hair growth direction and peel back against hair growth - it&#x27;s not a straight up pull where you&#x27;re ripping your skin upward, it&#x27;s more of a fast peel action in the opposite direction of the hair</li>
            <li>After i used it, my skin turned normal (from being bright red) in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so.</li>
            <li>rinse the fabric strips with warm water when I&#x27;m done and press them flat to dry.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff doesn&#x27;t really burn or sting when you rip it off; it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe.  </li>
            <li>Works great but so sticky that it&#x27;s hard to open the Harv</li>
            <li>would, you just want it to be warm and lessen the original thick consistency enough so that application is smoother.</li>
            <li>So, I learned how to make it thanks to youtube and haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since.</li>
            <li>Have used wax, sugar based products, the whole spectrum, this really doesn&#x27;t attach well at all, and you have to do each area 2-3 times before you get the desired results, which means more time, and slightly raw skin.  </li>
            <li>More control, and less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, absolutely no pain, job is done in minutes and wash away the wax with water.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to remove with warm water if you spill the wax or decide that it is too painful, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>and I was never super satisfied with the look afterwards.</li>
            <li>I would say I have enough product left over for three more applications on my lower legs.  </li>
            <li>sure you pull the cloth as parallel to your skin as possible.</li>
            <li>I purchased the classic kit (with tea tree oil).    </li>
            <li>I was ripped off but at least I now know of a way to wax effectively without going to a pricey salon in this economic climate.</li>
            <li>(unless you have the larger jar, but that will probably go quick as well.)    </li>
            <li>It did not take all the hairs in area applied and took several times to get it completely hair free.</li>
            <li>While I really like this--doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing, all natural, reusable cloth strips--there are some cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very specific to the direction of your growth, if that makes any sense, more so than regular wax.</li>
            <li>Main reason being for comfort, not looks.  </li>
            <li>It has to be hot to spread, problem is it burns if you have it hot enough to spread.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent stuff.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I got this stuff mainly for my brows, so</li>
            <li>It definitely worked by those directions, actually a lot better than the product I&#x27;d used before this.</li>
            <li>Getting older, means getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pull strip in the opposite direction as the wax was applied at a 45 degree angle quickly.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up burning and blistering my skin the first time I used this product because the wax was so hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used standard wax and then Moom, and the Moom is much better than just regular wax.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m practically stubble free and not one single bump.</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m a man that wanted to clean up his chest and other areas and not have to do it all the time.</li>
            <li>but really, you need it to be pretty liquidesque to get a nice thin layer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get every single little microscopic hair on the first try, but I think it will just take a little practice to get perfect results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching it before you start.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>and I have a high pain threshold.</li>
            <li>On some, I folded them, but that wasn&#x27;t highly successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>but despite all of the high praises for Moom, I think it is a bit overrated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li>methods\\&quot;, you should not be lead to believe that this is a painless operation, and I have high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as it has NO chemicals to deal with.</li>
            <li>Before using this, I highly recommend watching the how-to video offered by Moom&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>First time waxing at home, I bought this as my skin is very sensitive and it had the tea tree oil and was completely organic.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for a home waxing kit.</li>
            <li>High quality fabric strips.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people who are looking for a waxing product.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes from this product after looking at the reviews.</li>
            <li>so I highly doubt its my technique, the was just won&#x27;t grab onto those hairs.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They usually never included enough wax strips to do 2 full legs.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product, even first time waxers!</li>
            <li>Even though this was my first time and thus I would expect it to take longer to do the whole thing, it probably took less than an hour, but in my case, the need to move back and forth to get things (re-heat the product, get a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time.</li>
            <li>I found it worked a little bit better if I waited for about a minute before removing the strip.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>(a little more than a stubble)</li>
            <li>, I feel that it is not strong enough for the bikini area which although sensitive I think benefits from a very strong but quick wax.</li>
            <li>You may want to look into a candle warmer or something to keep the wax warm, because it becomes hard to spread when it cools off.</li>
            <li>removed facial hair with less pain than waxing and threading; product residue easily washes off face and hair removal strips with just water;strips are reusable after drying; no terrible odor; no need to heat up; convenient small container so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a huge pot of sugar    </li>
            <li>I swabbed the area with a little alcohol first, and when this dried, applied a light dusting of powder so the MOOM would stick better.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put more wax on it and try to pull it out again - move on to other areas, then wash and dry the areas that need to be gone over again and start fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like that this is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it is natural and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, reasonably priced and</li>
            <li>It was quite messy as well but easy to clean up then regular wax.</li>
            <li>but it felt no worse then having this done at a professional spa, which I have done.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and am pleasantly surprised that it worked really well on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Always use on CLEAN, DRY skin, and also use baby powder beforehand.  </li>
            <li>Much faster to just shave, or get it done professionally.</li>
            <li>You really do need to remove any natural oils</li>
            <li>I was not happy with this product at all, I will admit it was the first time I have use this kind of method.</li>
            <li>I did not experience the redness/bruises that I do with normal wax.  </li>
            <li>hot enough (obviously don&#x27;t burn yourself, but I get it pretty hot).</li>
            <li>THIs product was a total success for  me!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it pays for itself if you normally pay to get waxed.</li>
            <li>It is a bit messy but gets better each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>make sure hair is not too long and not too short</li>
            <li>Second attempt: 2 weeks worth of leg hair</li>
            <li>I will update this review after I try waxing an area that I normally shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was 3/8&amp;#34; or so long, applied the sugar to the strips (at room temp) and pressed it into the hair, starting at the top of my man area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably different for every person, and I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I heated it for 10 seconds in the microwave, still seemed pretty thick, so I gave it 5 more seconds.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure waxing would&#x27;ve killed me maybe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I will need to follow up the moom with either plucking/epilating or shaving these leftover hairs or try moom again in a few more days.</li>
            <li>and I rarely ever need to use the latter.</li>
            <li>This product did smell good and was not at all irritating to my skin, but it does nothing for its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>Give it a good stir and apply a thin layer to the area to be waxed.</li>
            <li>but it was really hard to get at the right temp and keep it warm so you can actually do a leg.</li>
            <li>Sure, there is some pain involved, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, and, when you wax on a regular basis, the pain lessens since the hair root weakens and the hairs pull out more easily.  </li>
            <li>The idea of this stuff is great (organic, easy to clean up, less painful), but the stuff itself is ehh.    </li>
            <li>Long story short, I am very familiar with waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to use</li>
            <li>While the shingles lesions quickly went away, I was left with pretty severe post herpetic neuralgia (aka: pain) on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li>It cools off pretty quickly and needs to be reheated several times when doing a big area like legs-</li>
            <li>That was a slightly more difficult task I will say and the hair did not come off as easily</li>
            <li>Whereas, on washed, cleaned hair, such as my pubs and bikini area, the wax didn&#x27;t grab hold of the hair too well and caused more pain than the dry, uncleaned hair of the arm pits.</li>
            <li>I liked Moom&#x27;s idea of using a couple of extra tools ( spreading stick and cloths) to get the job done with less agony.</li>
            <li>I do get some red bumps in several spots on my face; but they go away very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had been going for professional waxing or using other famous brands for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but they give you more than enough for a single use.  </li>
            <li>3rd time is a charm, right?</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right, but I tried every way possible.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of Moom though after doing my right leg (and there was still hair left).  </li>
            <li>Only positive is it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li>Your hair has to be super long before MOOM will work.  </li>
            <li>I would use this in my cool, dry room, use the witch hazel to wipe off any excess and then take a bath to wash off all of the residue</li>
            <li>It just needs a few seconds in the microwave and it stays warm enough to use for more than long enough to wax your face.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it works better when the wax is warmer and can spread thinner without pulling on loose hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that I would be pleased with the results from the first use; before I began the waxing process, I assured myself that I would need to be patient and give it a few tries just in case it didn&#x27;t work out at first.</li>
            <li>My hair is somewhat fine and actually would take about 3 weeks before it started to grow back after a visit to the salon.    </li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll almost certainly have to go over the same area again to get all of the hair (which is why it takes so much).</li>
            <li>so I would either have to shave to get smooth skin now or wait for the other hair to grow out and try again...</li>
            <li>so you can stick it back on when you are dipping your little pot of miracle into warm water.</li>
            <li>The wax gets extremely hot very fast, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to sugaring and waxing altogether, so this was an experiment.</li>
            <li>Unlike waxing, which also grabs live cells, Moom doesn&#x27;t tear your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I had to order a new package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 strips about a dozen times and they are still like new.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any new ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing that area</li>
            <li>She has used an Epilator for years now but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 and fairly new to hair removal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing.</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical city (Miami, Florida)</li>
            <li>I am a new user to waxes and sugar waxes</li>
            <li>day, while inspecting my new growth I decided to give it another try and to my surprise it worked,</li>
            <li>Maybe because I am fairly new at all of this</li>
            <li>You definitely do have to go over most areas more than once, especially if your hairs grow in pretty random directions and not in much of a \\&quot;pattern\\&quot; like mine.  </li>
            <li>, this is a nicer product that hurts less, smell delicious and causes way less damage than the other waxes.</li>
            <li>a professional might be the better choice for the initial go due to how much hair men have.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked amazing for my eyebrows but had a harder time clinging to the small fine hairs on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>-It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, so you can wax your skin multiple times without much irritation.</li>
            <li>It effectively removes all but a few stubborn hairs and my skin doesn&#x27;t turn red at all.</li>
            <li>PROFESSIONAL WAXER DOES A MUCH MORE THOROUGH JOB AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLY MESSY AND INCONSISTENT EFFECTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When at last I could hold the jar comfortably in my hand, I gathered the included wooden spatula and dipped into the goo -  ladies, it is like trying to dip honey with a stick.  </li>
            <li>(Comes with very clear instructions, too, for beginners.)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and found there is no irritation or redness whatsoever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use it my skin gets very sensitive for a couple of days, almost untouchable, add to that the fact I get ingrown hair</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Note that I use this on some very sensitive areas,</li>
            <li>, I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at both</li>
            <li>I do have a high pain tolerance, but all women know the bikini area is always incredibly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily be cleaned after you are done and doesn&#x27;t leave any mess, just damp towel with water.</li>
            <li>Be sure that hair has somewhere to grow out of!&lt;br /&gt;- a few drinks can really help in the pain area (but not so much in the making a mess area) ;)if you&#x27;re doing it yourself and you&#x27;ve never done it before.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Be sure that hair has somewhere to grow out of!&lt;br /&gt;- a few drinks can really help in the pain area (but not so much in the making a mess area) ;)</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area because otherwise you just waste it and it is more clean up and could be irratating.</li>
            <li>Even if you are messy, the clean up is easy with just a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li>If the bottle sticks shut for the next use, run it under hot water and it softens the sugar.</li>
            <li>I expect there won&#x27;t be bleeding next time around if the trend is consistent.     </li>
            <li>Trust me, if you&#x27;re waxing for the first time, especially in the bikini area, choose Moom!!</li>
            <li>I used one of the larger wooden sticks to spread the first layer, and the first mistake was made.</li>
            <li>I tried my Moom for the first time yesterday on my upper lip and eyebrow area.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and even though it removed some hairs it left A LOT</li>
            <li>Thirdly, this was my first ever waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it works better than any other hair remover I&#x27;ve ever used (Nads, Veet, Nair, Tweezers).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have never written a review about anything before, but I got Moom in the mail today and WOW!</li>
            <li>Lastly, I ended up burning myself (ugly scars on my upper-lip that healed after a week) 2-3 times because the wax gets very hot under the top layer, but the top layer doesn&#x27;t appear affected by the heat</li>
            <li>Anyone who is having trouble either is probably using too much wax (then you only pull off the excess wax) or has more resistant hair than I do.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s usually smaller, finer hairs remaining after a first wax.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I microwaved the glass jar (lid off) for 10 seconds, which was enough, since it&#x27;s hot today.</li>
            <li>After 40 seconds, it was suddenly too hot.</li>
            <li>I tried sally hansen brazilian wax to begin with my first time waxing my bikini BIG mistake.</li>
            <li>I DID end up breaking out in whiteheads on my face, just as I had with regular hot wax.  </li>
            <li>My first time waxing was the hardest though since I had a low tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>On the small amount of wax that I was able to apply, it did remove some hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ll try again, maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it well enough when I first used it.</li>
            <li>tips:&lt;br /&gt;--You want to make sure you are putting a small amount and spreading it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;--If</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually works really well, too!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve tried my very best.&#x3D;(</li>
            <li>All the hairs doesnt come up in one take, i need to try 2-3 times to come up completely!</li>
            <li>just enough so that it is easier to spread on your skin, but not too hot or else</li>
            <li>It helped but wasn&#x27;t  hot enough.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Every time I pulled off a strip, I had to stop and say WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow, I feel like a woman again!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It will give you the EXACT same results!</li>
            <li>For those of you girls out there that have a great, thick head of hair but have problems with other areas of your body, I&#x27;m one of you, buddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>The second learning cure involves when to scream - first time there was a bit of a shock, a delay</li>
            <li>I mentioned this to my friend, she told me that she had the exact same experience</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li>Ladies, do not expect assistance from your &amp;#34;better half&amp;#34; - mine grew wide eyed and ran out of the house when I sweetly asked for some help here.  </li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I wasn&#x27;t nervous, especially because I knew this comes right off with water (quite easily, actually--just wet a washcloth and rub it over the sticky area</li>
            <li>I decided to go back the next day and clean up the area</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to put on, and requires less frequent reapplication than shaving.</li>
            <li>very fine hair, but I never liked it.</li>
            <li>I only had to heat it in my microwave the initial time for 10 seconds, and it stayed warm enough to use for the entire 30 minutes I needed to do my waxing.  </li>
            <li>I did the bikini area, which I assume is one of the most sensitive body parts, and yet I had very little pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quickly and easily removed the trouble hair I no longer wanted.  </li>
            <li>I should note that if I accidentally pluck a hair that is too far into my eyebrows I bleed as well, and hot wax made my eyebrows red and swollen for a week.     </li>
            <li>After the first strip on a particular area, the second one barely stingsat all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more manageable to spread thin layer of wax on the cloth than it is on your body, especially for smaller, more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the same as the hot wax and strips that Everyone offers.</li>
            <li>and it was my first time working with such tools I completely tore that stuff up.</li>
            <li>mom had sworn by Nads in the past, so I was gonna go for that, but this stuff was cheaper and looked to be not only cost effective, but</li>
            <li>You have to heat it for about 15 seconds before it can be soft enough to use, at which point the mixture is too hot to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mainly on my legs and worked very well and didn&#x27;t need to wax for almost 2 whole months until the hairs started to grow back, but in much smaller amounts.</li>
            <li>Since this was my first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in this option in case it didn&#x27;t work out, but I plan on getting a warmer for next time, and there will definitely be a next time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair on my underarms is a bit more coarse and it was long enough</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t hurt so much as the other ones, including the wax that I used to get done in the parlor.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad, the prodcut smells super good, my super-ultra-sensitive-allergic-to-everything skin doesn&#x27;t have any side effects with Moom.</li>
            <li>Moom allows me to spend more time actually removing hair, and less time preparing.</li>
            <li>I used the entire 6oz jar on just the bottom half of each leg, and they are STILL more than 60% covered in hair.</li>
            <li>No matter if I tried it on the more course hair on my legs or the less course stubs of my eyebrows to even the finest hair above my lip or under my chin..</li>
            <li>and I only reacted mildly for a short time.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the hair grew back quickly</li>
            <li>The stomach hair was easiest to remove; the other areas required multiple times to wax off (mainly due to a few hairs that were being stubborn), for those its best to just pluck off.     </li>
            <li>few months ago, I read an Amazon review from someone who used MOOM cold -- i.e. room temperature, she didn&#x27;t heat it up first -- and liked it better that way.</li>
            <li>So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn&#x27;t really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are a female and you don&#x27;t want to use this on a large area it would probably work, but</li>
            <li>; 2) don&#x27;t press down on the strips, just rub three times quickly; 3) don&#x27;t overheat the wax... and the wax melts from the center so even though the bottle feels cool</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, doesn&#x27;t hurt too much, don&#x27;t have to warm it up when using it for facial hair, and it is easy to wash the cloths.</li>
            <li>Apply it very, very thin in the direction of the hair growth, lightly rub down on the muslin strips then give it a good, continuous yank.  </li>
            <li>That way I can use a more generous amount without trying to be so sparing with this tiny little jar.    </li>
            <li>I had waxed most of my bikini area except left a little strip on each side of the lips.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After more searching, I ordered hard wax without strips ([...]</li>
            <li>I guess I had very high expectations, reading the prior customer&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little messy but clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>a thick coat will just leave you with a gooey mess  * after putting the strip on the waxed area, make sure you rub it (not hard but quickly)</li>
            <li>I was shaving as often as I knew I was going to wear shorts or short sleeved shirts, and you guys shaving got old fast.</li>
            <li>The directions are clearly written.</li>
            <li>This one is less sticky and easier to clean up after.</li>
            <li>I did an immediate clean up of the counter, the sink and the floor and left the strips to dry.  </li>
            <li>I clearly need to let the professionals do the work and keep my daytime job.</li>
            <li>Not as efficient as wax but much less pain and easier to clean after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it done professionally (</li>
            <li>Not messy.  </li>
            <li>and they are ready to reuse for the next use.</li>
            <li>Maybe the wax was old or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend a considerable amount of time doing this, but I guess I&#x27;ll get faster if I keep it up...</li>
            <li>Having never used a wax or sugaring product before, it took me the whole package of cloth strips to do my upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that waxing will never be completely painless.</li>
            <li>, the redness faded and it was soft.</li>
            <li>a professional.</li>
            <li>, the redness faded and it was soft.</li>
            <li>a professional.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural, no wax hair removal product.</li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised.</li>
            <li>Compared to waxing, sugar is nearly painless.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like I was ripping off an old bandage, I just feel the sticky sugar lifting off of my skin.     </li>
            <li>All in all, I found the results were to my liking, and I thought the price was reasonable since you can get a lot of hair from just a tiny application of the paste.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or your time on this product.  </li>
            <li>I waxed my legs completely and wanted to keep going.  </li>
            <li>this product works really well if you use it properly.</li>
            <li>* wash the area before waxing (any lotions, natural oils, etc will interfere with the ability of the product to stick to the hair)  </li>
            <li>use this primarily to remove facial hair (upper lip and chin), and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove my hair, and doesn&#x27;t go far at all.</li>
            <li>My husband loves my soft skin opposed to stubles from shaving.</li>
            <li>my guess is that I was sold an old wax or something...</li>
            <li>Do not warm the Moom more than advised.  </li>
            <li>Apply the strip, ensuring that you move your hand across the strip so that it is adhered and pull the strip with a fast motion in the opposite direction.  </li>
            <li>Before trying Moom, I was using Nads, another natural product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the Moom hair removal kit.  </li>
            <li>I think that is why people are experiencing hair breakage rather than hair being completely pulled off by the roots.</li>
            <li>: Btw I only use this for my bikini area (the whole area) and sometimes under arms, for everything else I use an epilator machine.</li>
            <li>I used harsher waxes for 15 years, and developed melasma from the skin layers they took off over time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go to a professional because of the horror stories I had heard, so I wanted to try sugaring since I heard you can do it all by yourself.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much smoother, and hair took longer to grow back than with shaving.</li>
            <li>, I find that it doesn&#x27;t catch as much hair, maybe the hair is too short?</li>
            <li>tried this again... removed the longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in.</li>
            <li>I have used about 3.longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in.</li>
            <li>lower neck hair look no further, this stuff really works and beats paying $450 at a hair removal place.</li>
            <li>will admit that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too sensitive to use products like Nair.</li>
            <li>I have never waxed before - the whole idea sounded too intimidating, especially after hearing tales of ingrown hairs and damage to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten it professionally done</li>
            <li>-removes coarse leg hair  -gentle on the skin  </li>
            <li>I can now wax all my areas, and not have to do it all the time and wear a bathing suit without feeling self conscious.</li>
            <li>When I used them, I had considerable bruising which I&#x27;ve never had with the lightweight strips.</li>
            <li>I spoke with the Moom company directly</li>
            <li>I have to admit it actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have two young kids</li>
            <li>but MOOM has completely saved my life.</li>
            <li>You are pulling hair out by the root in sensitive areas, sooooo</li>
            <li>(Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavendar version for sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li>I heated it for 15 seconds (even though the manual says you don&#x27;t really need to do this for facial applications)</li>
            <li>As someone with horribly sensitive skin, I decided to give in and try waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Keeps skin soft</li>
            <li>I bought this at a natural food store</li>
            <li>This Moom product is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gone to a salon to be professionally waxed as well as done it myself with products from walgreens and also with nads.</li>
            <li>A pleasure to use, simple to do yourself and very efficient.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s still so much product left</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and everything I have ever used has caused problems for me.</li>
            <li>Do some prepping before hand - the day before waxing, exfoliate skin to remove dead skin and moisturize lightly ( i like to use coconut</li>
            <li>The only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was fast shipping</li>
            <li>No irritation afterwords which really surprised me</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally done.  </li>
            <li>think you really need to understand how waxing works and how to apply the solution and all that for this to work properly for you.</li>
            <li>to a very understandable no return policy on Amazon for this product, I went to Moom itself to get info on shipping it back.  </li>
            <li>my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back yet, it DOES miss hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be very similar to wax, removing the hair with not too terribly much pain.</li>
            <li>but, overall, the appearance is much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>(170 g) 100% Natural Hair Remover.&lt;br /&gt;18</li>
            <li>As far as waxing the underarms and Bikini area, it did</li>
            <li>This was used so far to remove excess eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>I switched to Moom after I was burnt at a salon getting my eyebrows waxed, since then I have had insanely sensitive skin in the area</li>
            <li>(I am sensitive anyway)</li>
            <li>and I think the hair is not growing back as much.</li>
            <li>but after you figure it out it actually works and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as waxing.</li>
            <li>you do have to let your hair get pretty long for it to work well.</li>
            <li>I had bought this just for my upper lip, but I really like it</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really wish I could have my money back.</li>
            <li>The first time my hair growth was about a month long</li>
            <li>Natural scent.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t pull it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re using it on a sensitive</li>
            <li>Definitely heat it up in the microwave vs in hot water, though be careful it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a wax so we&#x27;ll see how long it works.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell with this</li>
            <li>(oh yeah, and rinses off completely with water... not the end of the world here)</li>
            <li>But the pain really isn&#x27;t avoidable for coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bits that cleave onto your skin even after a shower as it is just natural sugar.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You have to do it fast and parallel to the surface.</li>
            <li>the wax directly to your skin.</li>
            <li>otherwise it won&#x27;t work nearly as well</li>
            <li>I had tried this same type of product for unwanted facial hair before without success, but decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>wax is extremely sticky and kind of stringy, so be cautious when opening it, otherwise you&#x27;re gonna have a wax mess</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of tries to get the trick, but if you follow the directions carefully you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and unfortunately you really do have to go without shaving for two weeks for this to work effectively.</li>
            <li>The good reviews are all fake.</li>
            <li>The instructions say not to warm it for the face, but you can still spread it fairly thin.  </li>
            <li>I find that when the consistency is like thick syrup - its easiest to spread thinly which helps pick up the hair best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product left behind a good amount of hair in all of the areas.</li>
            <li>see other reviewers complaining that this doesn&#x27;t remove fine hairs -- traditional wax won&#x27;t either</li>
            <li>In that event, I do pop it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds and then wait for it cool down</li>
            <li>Wow, to my surprise, no dark area anywhere!  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like how quickly the wax cooled down, by time I was ready it was already turning white.</li>
            <li>It really is nicer to be able to do this at home without worrying about the wax dripping down your eyebrow and causing you to wax off half an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>This wax is better the other wax products I have tried because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and its the only one I have found that I have actually gotten to work.</li>
            <li>I did experience some very minor and not visible bruising with use, but as this was my first time it could have been an error on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sugar based, we even reuse the strips by letting them soak in hot water, rinsing them, and letting them air dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, my girlfriend and I are addicted to waxing each other.</li>
            <li>Superior to other &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; hair removers as it is much easier to use (but read the directions!), less messy, and no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>True, there was no mess, and it hurt less.  </li>
            <li>It took me a few sessions and many hours to finally be hair free, and the hair came back in less time than if I had depilated.</li>
            <li>Stick to the gold standard in hair removal - classic old sugaring.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s also why it hurts less, because it has such a strong hold.    </li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not as harsh as hot wax.</li>
            <li>At least not one that  a little warm water can&#x27;t take care of!    </li>
            <li>NO it will not get all the hair at once regardless, even at a professional place - hair grows at different rates and lengths which is why salons will have you come back for a follow up if you&#x27;re a first timer.</li>
            <li>no mess what so ever.</li>
            <li>Overall, when it did successfully grab hair, it removed it completely and wholly; however, it does tend to leave patches unless I was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- When you put the waxed cloth on the body part your targeting, just tap and rub it a few times gently, making sure its in place, that also slightly warms the wax.</li>
            <li>Even though the process is messy, clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li>I was still using big strips, and so I was coming up with a decent amount of hair, but</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for my legs and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Particularly with the Moom because they don&#x27;t give you enough strips or Moom stuff to do it all at once.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I&#x27;ve only used epilators so my pain tolerance might be slightly higher than someone with no experience with depilation.</li>
            <li>I just used this kit for the first time to wax my upper lip and eyebrows and I am totally sold on it.  </li>
            <li>I know Moom makes a mens gel, but the main ingredients are the same, plus my wife plans on using it too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, fair-skinned, fair-haired with normal not edpecially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I just wasn&#x27;t following the directions, but I read it, reread it, re-applied the wax over and over again, but this item is totally trash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of afraid to get it too hot.</li>
            <li>It was sticky and messy and caused me more pain than I had felt in a long time.</li>
            <li>Normally the fabric for the large and small strips is of a lightweight muslin; however, in the kit I received, the large strips are of a heavier weight muslin.  </li>
            <li>I am really impressed with that part - other types I&#x27;ve used generally get cold and harden up after just a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>The hairs grew back MUCH finer, in fact, it was hard to even see the hairs in the mirror they were so fine.  </li>
            <li>After applying the strip, I would wait about 10 seconds before removing it to give the sugar time to cool off a little.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never gotten it quite right any other way.</li>
            <li>this was pretty easy to use with little mess.  </li>
            <li>It just does NOT work -- on the legs one would have to do the same spot over and over again to see any good results; and for eyebrows - simply useless: it does not pick up the tiny hair -- which is the whole point of waxing eyebrows.</li>
            <li>(it does NOT cool quickly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kinda messy to apply (&#x27;strings&#x27; everywhere), but cleanup is easy enough.</li>
            <li>There are two sizes of strips- small and HUGE</li>
            <li>Keeping a wet cloth nearby will help the process go more smoothly since sticky fingers make it difficult.</li>
            <li>it makes life so much easier and the hair stays gone for a long time.</li>
            <li>You stay hair free for a long time compared to shaving which actually makes waxing save you time in the long run.</li>
            <li>The results were about the same, only more messy.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this if your hair is long enough, but if not, normal waxing would be better.</li>
            <li>I carefully read the directions and exactly followed them, and tried again on 3 separate occasions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did hurt a bit, but I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything else, so I am not sure what kind of pain I&#x27;d get with other products...</li>
            <li>(I normally use wax strips for my upper lip).    </li>
            <li>, the wax in the center can be hot; 4) trim the hair to 1cm, any longer</li>
            <li>Just be careful when using and don&#x27;t overheat in microwave, as I burned my finger the first time using it.  </li>
            <li>Place the waxed strip on wherever you&#x27;re hairy and press in, making sure to rub the back of the strip back and forth a few times.</li>
            <li>Even upon repeated application I could not get all of the hairs as I normally would with regular wax.</li>
            <li>The directions are spot-on, though it could clarify how quickly you should be pulling and other minor details for people new to waxing-type hair</li>
            <li>I just wash them right after use and dry them for next time.</li>
            <li>It works very much the same way as wax, but smells much better and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was afraid it would.</li>
            <li>The whole hair follicle comes out and it takes a considerable long time to grow (about the same time when you get waxed professionally).</li>
            <li>The wax itself was not a really good one, and it gets cool down easily.</li>
            <li>Not as painful as the other stuff I tried and so much more effective.</li>
            <li>It really lasts long!</li>
            <li>at a time, apply a very thin coat, use quickly so it doesn&#x27;t cool down too quick.</li>
            <li>But as far as effectiveness - not a single hair was missed for me.</li>
            <li>So much better than hard wax!</li>
            <li>is smooth and with no irritation, minimal bleeding, but that was expected.</li>
            <li>It got all the hairs, clean up was simple, and it hurt WAY less.</li>
            <li>It really is a sugar wax, similar to what Middle Eastern women have used for centuries: since 1900 BC, Wikipedia says!</li>
            <li>because it left my legs itchy and red and really irritated.</li>
            <li>It is so sticky, though -- whether it&#x27;s warm or cold, the wax stays very sticky.</li>
            <li>You cannot twist the cap back on because the wax never fully hardens -- it stays sticky so you just have to sort of gently lay the cap back on the container.</li>
            <li>You will definitely need 2 of them and you will probably have to use it over multiple days to really get the hair</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this item should come with more strips.</li>
            <li>so if this makes it longer then even a week and a half its worth the money already.</li>
            <li>For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much.</li>
            <li>However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well.</li>
            <li>Then wait for like 2-3 seconds (gives time for the sugar to settle) and pull with a quick firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then wait for like 2-3 seconds (gives time for the sugar to settle) and pull with a quick firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to figure this out, but I love it now.</li>
            <li>Moom got virtually all my hairs, minus a few strays that I plucked with tweezers when I was done...even better than the at home waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It didnt hurt like at all, but it was super messy</li>
            <li>I grew the hair out for 2 weeks prior to using and the hair was a little more than 1/8 inch long.</li>
            <li>The directions do say to let your hair grow out a certain length, but that&#x27;s just not realistic when it&#x27;s spring time in Texas.</li>
            <li>more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the first time the other day on my upper lip (which I&#x27;ve never done before) and WOW, it seriously didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blisters after waxing.</li>
            <li>and then I have very sensitive skin, so I had to deal with red skin for days.. &lt;</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin was left very soft.</li>
            <li>The pubic hair region is a little more painful than the underarms, but after a while I really did not feel it because I was more focused on getting the hair removed than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This wax barely removes any hair!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again, my sensitive skin has no complaints!</li>
            <li>I warmed it in the microwave and was shocked how long it stayed warm!!</li>
            <li>I want to thank moom for creating a product with such natural, non harmful ingredients!</li>
            <li>and so the next time I followed the directions completely and was amazed by the results!</li>
            <li>Definitely use the corn starch on the skin before &amp;#34;mooming.&amp;#34; It is kind of annoying to have to reheat the product several times during use, but other than that it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>so it took a couple of tries to get it right, by my third time waxing</li>
            <li>After you&#x27;re done, you just rinse the strips in hot water and lay them out to dry for next time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The sides of my calves are now starting to feel like carpet because I&#x27;m so anxious to try it on my legs that I&#x27;ve stopped shaving and started covering them up(not easy since its summer</li>
            <li>The reusable strips wash off so easily, and that was a feature I was pretty skeptical about.</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time using an at home wax (or waxing at all), I thought my first failure may have been my fault.  </li>
            <li>It would remove the very fine hair but even with repeated uses, still did not remove the stubborn coarse hair which is always the most annoying to deal with.  </li>
            <li>This product will obviously work differently for every person, but if you read the instructions a few times and get a clear idea of the process in your head before you try it, I truly believe things will go smoothly.</li>
            <li>(I went slowly since this was my first time doing a full wax on myself, but I imagine that next time it should only take me about 15 minutes.)  </li>
            <li>Once I used a very thin layer of the mixture instead of the thick clump I started out doing and got the hang of how to lift, it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I follow the instructions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, and have tried every which way to get it to work (leaving the strip on longer, using more, using less, re-doing it, rubbing the strip harder, softer, etc.,) and it DOES get rid of some hair, but definitely not all of them.  </li>
            <li>I had never tried the waxing route before, but I was tired of plucking and the other reviews were good.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me on my ultra thin leg hairs, but it&#x27;s nice enough for other areas.</li>
            <li>The package includes both large and small sticks as well as large and small strips (though not enough of them - but fortunately I have a bunch of strips a friend gave</li>
            <li>I find it easiest to lay them in a shallow bowl of hot water so the wax loosens up, and then rub the wax off to clean them and let them air dry.</li>
            <li>So far, only her legs have shown this problem, but it&#x27;s still a major inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now I am left with a large red area on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I recently became a mom again just as my only child was off to high school..</li>
            <li>Ripping the strip - with one hand, pull your skin taut in the opposite direction of hair growth, while the other hand quickly rips the strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth (just like ripping off</li>
            <li>Almost just the same as any other wax, seemed extra super sticky though...</li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is not extraordinarily thick (i&#x27;m eastern european) or coarse, but the pain was nothing like the excruciating horror stories I heard--</li>
            <li>And make sure your hair is at least 1/4&#x27; in long before you wax</li>
            <li>By morning even though my lips were red-the next day it was clear and then I took a shower.</li>
            <li>Just be careful because it heats up quite fast in the microwave</li>
            <li>but for sensitive areas such as underarms, bikini, and face?</li>
            <li>but for sensitive areas such as underarms, bikini, and face?</li>
            <li>, my red-headed daughter tried to get professionally waxed and ended up very red, irritated and bruised.</li>
            <li>Left her skin soft and its been 2 weeks, no sign of regrowth</li>
            <li>Having never waxed before, I am not in a position to say how the pain compares, but I will say that I was surprised by the excruciating pain I endured whilst mooming previously only shaved areas.</li>
            <li>It barely took the hair off the legs.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this for anyone looking for natural waxes.</li>
            <li>I never waxed my legs before and have only gotten my arms and armpits professionally waxed twice.</li>
            <li>If your not careful with wax you could also pull off skin along with hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to wait weeks to remove the hair, I could barely stand the one week.</li>
            <li>(really just crushed up Asprin, witch hazel and alcohol).  </li>
            <li>Wax also used to leave my skin red and irritated for hours, even when done by a professional.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used barely any of it...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;ll bare my husband any children...</li>
            <li>O_o  </li>
            <li>Granted, you&#x27;ll need to buy bigger strips and more product to do larger areas, but that is common sense...    </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive so doing it over the same area hurts.</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing so far that I have ever used, therefore I can&#x27;t compare it to waxing.</li>
            <li>It took forever and the 6oz jar I bought would not be near enough.</li>
            <li>I paid around $13 for a complete kit with two different size strips, sticks, instruction booklet, and a glass jar of the sugar</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely, a couple times, but it wouldn&#x27;t remove the tiny hairs I have.</li>
            <li>After dabbing the wax into my eyebrow hairs, I pulled my skin back and peeled off the strip as fast as possible (in the opposite direction of hair growth) and all the hairs literally came out!</li>
            <li>so when this stuff pulled it out i was :O</li>
            <li>I took a shower and my skin was not as nearly as sensitive as with regular wax.</li>
            <li>But with Moom, barely any hair came out, if any.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft and lighter skinned.</li>
            <li>It will remove hairs, but you will probably end up with patchy skin hair as you wait a couple of day to go back to your old remover.</li>
            <li>Also, as I vaguely mentioned above, I do heat it up in the microwave so that it is more spreadable, but I do wait for it to go back to room temperature first.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it worked sometimes it go barely any hair.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake with Moom, even if it is a spill, wet the wash cloth with hot water from the tap, squeeze the extra from the cloth and wipe.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;While difficult, it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>it is extremely difficult to use alone,m effectively.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend laughed at me the other day because I seem to be coming up with random other places to wax for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>if the honey-like thing doesn&#x27;t completely become cold, the effort may not be such good.</li>
            <li>It gives me a freshly waxed smooth finish on my neck and chin and the few hairs that were left, I used a small electric razor to clip.</li>
            <li>Then ensure the area is completely dry and oil free, sometimes I dust a little baby powder over the area to ensure all oil is gone.</li>
            <li>I had a little bit of redness (above my eyebrow on the side that was affected by shingles), but the redness quickly went away.</li>
            <li>Being a first time waxer, I was down to try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used microwaveable body wax (sticky and complicated to get ready), naturally bare honey wax (natural, but extremely sticky/messy and hard to grasp the clear strips), wax strips (easy to use, but more wasteful than I&#x27;d like) and cream/gel hair removers (also gross).     </li>
            <li>it only left me red for a little less than a day (a great improvement over any other hair removal product).  </li>
            <li>This was my first time waxing, MOOm is so simple and easy to use that you cant go wrong for buying it.</li>
            <li>If anything it only made more of a mess and made it harder to properly apply the cloth.  </li>
            <li>I laid down the second swipe of wax, I made SURE to use MUCH less.</li>
            <li>stuff is so amazing, easy, and less painful.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>The other reason it didn&#x27;t work the first time is that I followed instructions and only warmed it for 10 seconds at a time which did not bring it to a state for spreading for me -</li>
            <li>, I had taken a warm bath at least 45 minutes before trying Moom, I applied a thin layer, I only quickly rubbed 3 times over the length of the strip, waited a few seconds, held the skin taut and ripped oft the stop as I have always done before hundreds of times with other wax lines (which have all worked fine for me).</li>
            <li>Its nicer than regular wax it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad just make sure you read the application instructions before your first usage if you never used the product before its not like your normal wax kit.</li>
            <li>I bought another kit the other day for my daughter-after seeing how well it works and how much it&#x27;ll save on salon waxing-</li>
            <li>First couple of times you&#x27;ll mess up</li>
            <li>I used this on my husband&#x27;s chest and pulled out most of his hair, but I know the fault of it was because they were too long and curly to pull out all at once, but once again its growing back slowly and for him, it beats the chore of shaving/</li>
            <li>With all the good reviews here I assume this is because I am not letting it grow long enough, but I just can&#x27;t go several weeks with hairy legs waiting for the hair to get long enough to remove (not sure how long that would take).</li>
            <li>It works awesome too even on the thick bikini area hairs and grabs them all as long as its used properly (a thin strip of wax!).</li>
            <li>Next strip a little better with a slight groan and shriek afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I can see what other reviewers mean that it&#x27;s so easy, it makes you want to wax it all!</li>
            <li>(I had never waxed myself before), just as or less painful than in the salon, and it actually works great!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re doing sensitive areas, use the smaller strips so you&#x27;re not yanking as much hair and therefore have less pain to deal with at a time until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>did notice, through pain induced misted eyes that I did NOT have the same red bumps or ingrown hair issues as I get with shaving, and as sensitive as the skin is</li>
            <li>did notice, through pain induced misted eyes that I did NOT have the same red bumps or ingrown hair issues as I get with shaving, and as sensitive as the skin is</li>
            <li>I just used it today (about 30 min ago) and the red spot I had near my upper lip is gone.    </li>
            <li>and I only used up a third of the wax so far.     </li>
            <li>I love that this stuff is non-toxic, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about inhaling its smell or letting it near my coochie.     </li>
            <li>Did not really remove hair very well for me, I tried different techniques to no avail.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re waxing sensitive areas for the first time (like the bikini area), use the small strips designated for your eyebrows/lip/chin.   </li>
            <li>Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>They recommend heating it up, but only so you can spread it more thinly.</li>
            <li>The pain only lasted for a few seconds, and this was absolutely worth the results.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I found that I was spreading it TOO thin, and it wasn&#x27;t working at all at first.  </li>
            <li>Would take off some hair, but most of it was left behind.</li>
            <li>The major hurdle is the temperature - Moom, I would pay extra for one of those temperature thingys etched into the side of the glass jar.  </li>
            <li>my stomach and chest (dense, coarse hair) was very painful to do but the results were excellent</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my skin at all (initial redness at first as always but gone in like half an hour).</li>
            <li>Also I had a slight irritation on my upper lip after all (I imagine from pulling the hair off a place for the first time)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very effective on facial hair, and not as painful as I imagined</li>
            <li>With this, because it doesn&#x27;t wax your skin, you can jump in the shower really quick if you get a little goopy( because this stuff doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin), wash off, pat dry and have another go.</li>
            <li>I plan to wait and see how long it takes for the irritation to clear up.</li>
            <li>I also came across some other promising things I could try my next time</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, I was trying it out to find and alternative to the other waxes, but I ended up using what was left over of my Sally Hansen kit to finish what Moom could not.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t that stubborn (thank goodness) but I can see where this product would work well where other, more common products may not.</li>
            <li>My issues came with the actual ripping process, because apparently I am a wimp when doing it to myself.</li>
            <li>Now the reason for the low score: there was not even enough product for one lower leg (I&#x27;m not exactly beastly hairy), not many waxing strips or tongue depressors provided (trying to get you into buying more of their products)</li>
            <li>It barely removed any hairs, probably only 5% of them.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe the hairs were not long</li>
            <li>I barely made a dent in the jar, so it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>At least one promise held true.</li>
            <li>At least one promise held true.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m disabled; my disability makes it a challenge to control my body.</li>
            <li>Just soak them in hot water for a few minutes, wring them out, and throw them in the dryer.</li>
            <li>I was careful to follow directions specifically; however, this product caused hair breakage (instead of pulling out by the root) and the absolute WORST case of ingrown hairs/red bumps I have ever experienced!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using moon hair removal wax for 3 ears since I first read about it in The Green Beauty</li>
            <li>First time user trying to save money at home turns into messy disaster with pain.</li>
            <li>It always leaves behind hair which kind of defeats my whole purpose of using it at the beginning, I guess my hair is a bit too thick for it?</li>
            <li>It certainly does not work with hair less than 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>If I do make a little mess with this product, it washes off quite easily with water.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very easy to clean up, re-usable strips, was not too painful (much less painful than home laser which i also tried for a short time), did not leave any kind of rash or reaction on my skin (a little redness in the pores faded in a couple of hours).</li>
            <li>but after it colds down the effort is very well.</li>
            <li>Less painful than waxing and a lot more effective than other methods of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>At least for me it was less pain as long as i kept it at a nice \\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistency.</li>
            <li>several other reviewers have mentioned, also be sure to follow the directions carefully:  using some baby powder, applying a very thin layer in the direction of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice thick consistency at room temperature and based on that thins out with just a very little bit of warming.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, it was the most painful experience EVER.</li>
            <li>There is definitely pain involved, as expected, but it&#x27;s much better than trying to tweeze the hairs off, fast, and the least messy waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for</li>
            <li>And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for you.      </li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and just heated slightly, applied the cloth and then gently pulled.  </li>
            <li>It left my lip itchy and red and barely took any hair off.</li>
            <li>I have had a few instances of bleeding from the hair follicle (it was not ripped skin), but I think it&#x27;s because some of the roots were pretty deep.</li>
            <li>You tend to get lazy when it starts to get thick again, but its way easier to spread when warm.  </li>
            <li>When it is finally spread thoroughly yet only a thing layer (as per directions), as I pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth, barely any hair came out!</li>
            <li>It is a little messy, but it washes off everything easily.</li>
            <li>And it works effectively, with very little mess or pain, just as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>It really does what it promises to do, painless, fast, and the truth is the hair does come back less and less.  </li>
            <li>Or, maybe the hairs were not long enough?  </li>
            <li>The kit has a glass container with 6 oz of product, about 10 or more long fabric strips, a few little strips, and wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>This worked great on my (south asian, thick, dark) hair and had lots of benefits over these other products, including that it dissolves with just water, so you aren&#x27;t left with sticky stuff all over your face, it left my face feeling soft and with no red spots, and it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this, if you&#x27;re new to waxing it might hurt but it will hurt a hell of a lot less than with any other.</li>
            <li>: Btw I only use this for my bikini area (the whole area) and sometimes under arms, for everything else I use an epilator machine.lso slightly warms the wax.</li>
            <li>The problem is, as much as I wanted to use and love this product, the kit is almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it on my legs in the near future since shaving my legs leaves stubble and has to be done every single day.</li>
            <li>Separate into smaller sections; for underarms, I do one half downward (lower half), the other upward, and one more for the entire armpit upward.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick to wax for my legs, it may hurt a little more but at least it works.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go back and catch the little stray ones as much.  </li>
            <li>It is messy to work with, hard to apply, even when heated, does not spread smoothly and an all around a dud!  </li>
            <li>My first 2 attempts were definitely user error, and apparently hair that had been previously shaved is extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s basically my favorite way of using this product, less messiness, less product wasting (for both the sugar and the cloths) and MUCH less</li>

            <li>I really appreciate that the company took the time to give instructions for each different area you could use the wax on, as there are small differences which can apparently increase your accuracy.</li>

            <li> I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see this product working perfectly!</li>
            <li> And what a great price!</li>
            <li> You have to practice to perfect your technique and maximize MOOM&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Awesome, awesome product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is one of the best wax I have used..</li>
            <li> &quot; works best in my experience.</li>
            <li> It explains perfectly how to heat it, apply it, remove it, everything.</li>
            <li> If you want to invest your money in a great product this is it!!!</li>
            <li> To my delight, everything went perfectly!</li>
            <li> And I find this is best...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, and I am very experienced with at-home waxing also, and it just wouldn&#x27;t grab all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this wax!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase ~</li>
            <li> After seeing the awesome reviews on here, I had to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it was delicious, but I don&#x27;t eat it by the spoonful</li>
            <li> I have got to say this is the best type of hair removal I have ever come</li>
            <li> but it is the best option I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Impressed!  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results.     </li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Best wax</li>
            <li> I done alot of research trying to figure out what was best to use,and it was all the reveiws I had read here on Amazon,that made me choose Moom.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and works wonderfully well to get all the hairs out.</li>
            <li> So today I tried the unbleached coffee filters cut to size-they worked perfectly and best of all are disposable.....</li>
            <li> This is just awesome!</li>
            <li> This product was awesome!</li>
            <li> Ladies and gents, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> It works best for me with one heat cycle in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I endured letting the hair get longer, as they say that makes the product work best.  </li>
            <li> It is a truly wonderful hair removal method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended it to both my sister AND my best friend!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, and is cruelty-free and organic.</li>
            <li> But I was very happy with the kit and the product.  </li>
            <li> The best experience ever.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!</li>

            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> for the best hair follicle ripping experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> delicious,  almost smells like something I&#x27;d feed to my nephews and neice.</li>
            <li> A sugar based wax is the best because it comes off with water.  </li>
            <li> The price is great!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I had no reason not to buy it!</li>
            <li> I also tried this on my legs and was not as impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Taste&#x27;s good too!!</li>
            <li> Buying it in the 6oz container 10 or 12 seconds is perfect to start.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly for me</li>
            <li> Incredible!</li>
            <li> Great product and company!</li>

            <li> I was also impressed with the reusable strips.</li>
            <li> warmed up for a bit in the microwave and this was the perfect wax.  </li>
            <li> works perfectly</li>
            <li> this works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels wonderful afterward.</li>
            <li> I picked one up at K-mart for $6 and it heated it to the perfect</li>
            <li> Moom works awesome.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews &amp; thought, this will work great!</li>

            <li> The best home removal system ever.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> but it worked for me and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Moom!!!</li>
            <li> I found that to be a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li> I used it for my bikini area, and it was very successful.</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant, but this will guarantee irritate your skin so ice it afterwards.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing experience!!</li>
            <li> so I ordered and just tried it this afternoon with very good results.</li>
            <li> it works very good.</li>
            <li> works very very good.</li>
            <li> , I did not have the ideal conditions: I have three children</li>
            <li> it was VERY easy to do!!</li>
            <li> and may your results be loved!</li>
            <li> , I loved it!</li>
            <li> Works really good!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even take off the fine hairs!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t all that great..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product, and the results.</li>
            <li> lol)</li>
            <li> Great results</li>
            <li> Works great...</li>
            <li> and I always get great results every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all the great reviews by everyone else.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought Moom from curiosity, and found the product to be great.</li>
            <li> But it worked GREAT on my bikini area that hadn&#x27;t been taken care of in a month or two.   </li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> Ive never heard of this brand before but all of the reviews were great</li>
            <li> The product is great, I&#x27;m quite happy w/</li>
            <li> great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that it has been almost 7 days</li>
            <li> What a great surprise.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> Noticed the great reviews for Moom</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I am still really happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and none of them worked so great.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m NOT an experienced waxer, so that may be part of the reason.</li>
            <li> lol..</li>
            <li> The sugar mixture and the cloth strips work GREAT together.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Seeing all the great reviews, I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie--I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great as all of the reviews had set it out to be, but all I could do was say \\&quot;Wow!\\</li>
            <li> It lives up to its great reviews.</li>
            <li> great product and received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Before she was using Sallys waxing kit and it wasnt as great as moom.</li>
            <li> It works great and it seems like it grabs all the hair in one pull</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have chemical sensitivities or allergies to chemical products and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It is a great alternative to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great on all areas that you have waxed before or never shaved.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me.</li>
            <li> however there were no bumps or any irritation that she usually experienced with plucking.</li>
            <li> Both her and I were happy about that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was really happily suprised at how well the product works.</li>
            <li> The cloth strips are great as they can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> Great product if your just wanting to try out wax or even if you have been doing it for awhile now.</li>
            <li> My Arab friends always relied on the sugaring method, but even though their eyebrows and face looked great</li>
            <li> The GREAT thing about this product is that it WASHES off with WATER.  </li>
            <li> but my eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li> Eureka, I was so happy.  </li>
            <li> I have had great results using it on my face  and arms.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this and have great results.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate and it works great.</li>
            <li> i was happy thinking it would work.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my face.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had great experiences with them...</li>
            <li> I was happy to read that sugaring is gentler because it doesn&#x27;t pull off a layer of skin like waxing does.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> great for the skin as well.</li>
            <li> Some people have commented that they did not have a great result with the product</li>
            <li> lol   </li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found suh a great organic non-toxic hair removal kit.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my legs and arms</li>
            <li> I heard great things about Moom</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> so something like this is great.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent for those who work with this kind of material at the hair salon...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product , and happy not to have to spend time in the mirror, plucking hair off my chin with a pair of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product, but nope.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> All of the great things about wax</li>
            <li> Great for brazilian waxes.  </li>
            <li> It is so great to see the root of the hairs on the strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not that great.</li>
            <li> Great customer service as always from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try this hair removal kit...</li>
            <li> but it would be really great if you had someone else to do those parts for</li>
            <li> and I am so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time trying any type of at home wax, so maybe that is my problem, but this stuff didn&#x27;t work as great as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> So - I got brave.  </li>
            <li> Ahhhhh the love!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!  </li>
            <li> Package came very nice.</li>
            <li> But it is very effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> your room is very warm</li>
            <li> The wax  adheres well to the hair and removes it very effectively</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this wax is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Moom sugar wax is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I used the oil provided after and all of the wax was gone AMAZING !</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> But this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing buy!</li>
            <li> Everyone who&#x27;s not already a pro at making sugar waxes would be well-justified in buying this kit one time for many happy hairless years!</li>
            <li> In fact, it just makes me even more impressed that I managed to pull it out!</li>
            <li> One drop did land on my skin, so I rubbed it off with warm water - NO STICKY RESIDUE!     </li>
            <li> After going to places like Walmart and settling for whatever chemical-laden products they have on the shelf, I am thrilled to find this!</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> then this product is NOT FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise: You will LOVE it since it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Most excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled why this product supposedly worked perfect for so many people.</li>
            <li> I already ordered more and already told my best friend to order it!!</li>
            <li> SUCCESSFULLY-</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another nice feature!</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I was using another famous brand (Nads) and was very happy about it.</li>
            <li> And this is the most wonderful item there is.</li>
            <li> and it removed my hair nicely!</li>
            <li> Warm up, apply, remove- done!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, remove, and does an excellent job with the hair.  </li>
            <li> The best part--it is so easy that you can do it at home without the expense of going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off easy, great money saver to wax at home!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t very good at controlling the application and accidently ripped out more eyebrows than wanted.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading so many great reviews, however my experience was anything but great.</li>
            <li> Bikini line and eyebrows worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> I managed to wax my legs fairly effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This wax doesn&#x27;t have a good grip of the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this MOOM product and it is really good.</li>
            <li> The product itself is really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it may not be for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews about this product</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> It smells good, 100% organic, tastes good, (I had some on my fingers and licked it off</li>
            <li> : This product has good ingredients</li>
            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This product is too good...</li>
            <li> so I bought the pre waxed strips because it said it was good for beginners.</li>
            <li> I have a good feeling about it though</li>
            <li> Good luck to all those who use this</li>
            <li> She loved the results.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like the pain but loved the result so she&#x27;ll keep it up.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on removing the hair though it does take a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a kit, and a good price, to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for a good product I can do at home</li>
            <li> and I read good reviews on Moom wax</li>
            <li> so my conclusion is that it might be good for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> If I microwave it about 15 seconds, the texture is good to spread</li>
            <li> tastes good if some gets in your mouth while doing lip area.</li>
            <li> It didnt come with good instructions either</li>
            <li> this product is good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if people expect having hair ripped out of your body to feel good</li>
            <li> The instructions make this product sound so unbelievably wonderful.</li>
            <li> For those who didn&#x27;t have a good experience, this is how I use it and it works perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good before using.</li>
            <li> so I could be good for about 7 days until it bugged the heck out of me again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested in both ways (without heat and with heat) and it came out decently good.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel completely fair to deduct from my rating when the product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s superior to waxing with chemical laden wax or using chemical hair dissolving creams.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating maybe.  </li>
            <li> This product was not as good a</li>
            <li> This is a good product to buy.</li>
            <li> Good product, and</li>
            <li> I just get so excited when I find a great all-natural (and organic!)</li>
            <li> It works best in its original form.</li>
            <li> So easy!!</li>
            <li> It was so easy!!</li>
            <li> The primary ingredient is sugar, so it&#x27;s very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It works great, with very detailed directions that help you get results.</li>
            <li> But very nice loved it besides that :)</li>
            <li> worked fine!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> This part is really a great concept, I just wish it worked better than wax.  </li>
            <li> Moom is a great product, have used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> She was very pleased about that.</li>
            <li> Works great, there is a learning curve for sure.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> Baby or talcum powder is great, helps the wax stick more to the hairs than the skin.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> pleased with quality of product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this product. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;wow\\&quot;ed and laughed because it was so amazing.</li>
            <li> It also did a thorough job removing hair and didn&#x27;t leave very many strays.</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews</li>
            <li> Sure, it sounds like a great idea - organic, no waxes or petroleum, etc.  </li>
            <li> It gives u everything u need to try out the product, which I ended up loving, and it&#x27;s a great price :-)</li>
            <li> It also has a very light, clean scent, and the reusable strips are great!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> It was the most amazing thing ever!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so I don&#x27;t need any more oil on my face!     </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s even organic!  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it was working, so I watched the tutorial video and tried again.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The first try I did on unwashed arm pit hairs and did an excellent job, without any pain.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I love that it washes off so well!</li>
            <li> I switched to Nair&#x27;s milk &amp; honey rollon, which is also water soluble, much better results!</li>
            <li> I was so glad I did!</li>
            <li> This product is even a more cost effective choice for me as well!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to all of my friends considering waxing and will continue to do so, this product is just fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I can handle this route for sure!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;--Waxing causes just as many ingrowns as shaving if you don&#x27;t exfoliate after use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now three times, and I have to say the best way to use it is exactly how the directions say.</li>
            <li> Love this sugar wax!</li>
            <li> Gotta love a wax that comes off with water!</li>
            <li> Its more like $20 because the product itself, shipping an handling and taxes!</li>
            <li> I also love that you can just wash off the cloth strips and use them again!</li>
            <li> So glad that I found that out!</li>
            <li> I recommend this stuff for sure!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF and just ordered it again!</li>
            <li> At first I tried applying Moom at room temperature (as a reviewer suggested it is best applied so).</li>
            <li> I love my moom hair remover!</li>
            <li> OK!</li>
            <li> But the pain lasts 2 or 3 seconds, and the results are outstanding!</li>
            <li> I love that this is water soluble!  </li>
            <li> I love that I can reuse the strips, too!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> and I totally love it!</li>
            <li> I love this wax!</li>
            <li> the thinner the better!</li>
            <li> I can go from like to love!</li>
            <li> I started using this about two or three months ago, and i just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, nontoxic, and, best of all, very easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because I now know how great sugaring is (very easy, practically painless)</li>
            <li> Application is easy, and the strips that are provided are great quality unbleached cotton.</li>
            <li> The strips are great and the product washes out of them easily</li>
            <li> I think the product may be fine for a salon or an experienced user.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use according to the directions and very effective on my leg.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> What is amazing about this product is that it acts like wax, but you can&#x27;t burn yourself and everything washes off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s amazing how this stuff washes off</li>
            <li> Thank you Moom for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Moom is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I was stunned with how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is amazing - truly.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Cleans up with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I especially love the reusable cloth strips since they were really easy to wash clean after each use.    </li>
            <li> i never tried waxing at home but  after reading so many  good reviews, i wanted to try this product</li>
            <li> it washes away with warm water.</li>
            <li> It also came off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it washes away with warm water.</li>
            <li> It also came off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing that&#x27;s nice about this is that the cloths that are use to place over the sugar substance can be washed and reused.</li>
            <li> and I put the product jar in a bowl with warm water.</li>
            <li> Okay, MOOM is good.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> packaging- organic- nice marketing concept/</li>
            <li> - It takes some practice to learn how to use it effectively.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also make your own sugar wax (recipes found online).  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best home hair removal product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;ve tried every kind of wax under the sun and none of it removes my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better/cheaper to just make your own sugar wax at home.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this product works for men too, albeit far from perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really liked how the wax didn&#x27;t get everywhere</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s under heated it doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair.</li>
            <li> But its just not as effective as wax...</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> and if your just doing your face you don&#x27;t even have to warm the wax up...</li>
            <li> I decided to go lady-balls to the wall and get a waxing kit and honestly, it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit</li>
            <li> While I liked this product for my legs</li>
            <li> It is quite catching.  </li>
            <li> After I used up the pot I made a batch of my own since, having used the Moom, I knew what it was supposed to look and feel like.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I hoped</li>
            <li> As soon as it hit my skin it got all mealy not at all like warm honey.  </li>
            <li> The sugar wax rinsed off the strips easily in warm water</li>
            <li> my leg hairs are well accustom to this kind of treatment.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li> I think I will heat the wax in a pot on the stove as directed and then use the heater to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t eat, so this fits in nicely with that.</li>
            <li> The reviews on Amazon were good and the price was better on Amazon than on Groupon.</li>
            <li> Just soak them in warm water and rinse.</li>
            <li> She keeps recommending it to me; but I don&#x27;t have the guts to wax on my own yet.</li>
            <li> (hey, it happens to all of us), just put some warm water on it and it disappears.</li>
            <li> and I burned my skin, now that is my own fault, but still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO thrilled to discover this product - thank you, thank you makers of MOOM for this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a bonus that you get to reuse the strips - cost and eco effective.</li>
            <li> but once I was done, I just hopped in the shower and rinsed the sugar off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Good, and you can use many times without risk.</li>
            <li> Good and safe, for people who have no time to go out, you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li> The reuseable strips are nice</li>
            <li> nice as it was to have a wax kit that was organic and water-soluble, I will not be buying this again, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now keep up with my brows and bikini line in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own issues with waxing</li>
            <li> The muslin strips are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Just microwave for 3 minutes, mix and apply warm with a stick, let solidify (1-2minutes) and peel off.</li>
            <li> tried many methods, and the best are: go pay for it to be done right, or get a body trimmer, and just keep the hair, albeit trimmed.</li>
            <li> Gentle, great value, very effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, wax is malleable and heats up in 10 seconds, the strips are also nice, and the oil is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Made my saturday night worth staying in!!!</li>
            <li> the first couple of times were though to do, one of the reason why I said that is great for those who are already good with this hair removal technique.</li>
            <li> The sugar washes off the reusable strips n application tools very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably get the goo on things but comes off anything very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> I will admit my first yank of the cloth was very surprising...</li>
            <li> We have been purchasing this for almost two years or more now and are always happy with the results and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is not painful.</li>
            <li> The best trick for me is applying baby powder since I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> I have to mention that I think real wax would probably work better, but this is great for the price and for what I use it for (face)!</li>
            <li> Easy, and smell is good.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d have one super great brow and one...</li>
            <li> I would like to see more strips and stick included with the kit, and the jar tends to get really sticky around the edges, hence the 4 stars, otherwise everything was great!</li>
            <li> A good amount of hair was easily removed&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27; rinses with water, the strips wash off VERY easily</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> The cloths that come with the product rinse out very easily and the product also rinses off skin easilly as well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> So, I was nervous the first time I used MOOM, but the experience was really good!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good; can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Very easy cleanup with warm water and love that the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li> I have tried anywhere between 5 and 10 products, and Moom is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair removal kit I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair removal for my face</li>
            <li> but Moom is the best so far.</li>
            <li> and it took a good minute to break it free with my fingers.</li>
            <li> It is the best wax I ever used by so far</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube instructional video on how to use the product most effectively (posted by Moom).</li>
            <li> This was the most ineffective kind of wax I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to warm the jar up as soon as I saw it thickening again.    </li>
            <li> The sugar wax smells delicious, rinsed off with water, and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The day after my skin was gorgeous and hair free.  </li>
            <li> I need to warm it up much more than the instructions said but that could be my microwave.</li>
            <li> and well it&#x27;s worth a try with all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> each use, you become more adept.  </li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with Moom.</li>
            <li> It also comes off so easily, which is perfect for when you use too much or drop some of it on your skin.</li>
            <li> But really, the best thing about Moom is how easily it comes off your skin and the cloth you use to wax.</li>
            <li> This one is very gentle yet VERY effective and I am super happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li> The hair came off easily and I was VERY satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> And cleanup is so easy with Moom!</li>
            <li> Also, it cleans up and washes off RIDICULOUSLY easy!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love love love this wax!</li>
            <li> It does how ever clean up very easy, so that is a plus!</li>
            <li> works great and not very painful</li>
            <li> It is definitely more effective with longer hair but still did not get all of the hair, even with more then one attempt.</li>
            <li> Overall though, great product and one that I am happy to have added to my subscription list.</li>
            <li> It was good in removing the hair and did not need to be repeated to clean up the skin.</li>
            <li> But I do know I am so happy, and empowered that I can do this all on my own and can save so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike wax, which requires special oils to remove, Moom is made out of sugar, so it washes off very easily with water, which also allows you to reuse the cloth!  </li>
            <li> I have learned how to pull just right and at an angle to get those more course hairs under control but it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good because warm water will wash it right off your clothes and body, and also because you don&#x27;t have to heat it up to use it.</li>
            <li> But in general it is great!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried waxing and this product made the experience unforgettable.</li>
            <li> you are willing to take the time and effort to learn how to use this, it is a great alternative to waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> I am pretty experienced with at home waxing.  </li>
            <li> First off, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> All the good things written about this product were true for me.  </li>
            <li> This sounded to good to be true.  </li>
            <li> - It doesn&#x27;t work on fine hair!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super effective, once you figure out the ideal temperature (if you try to start when it&#x27;s too hot, it won&#x27;t work).  </li>
            <li> I love the strips that is came with, its so easy and they are reusable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap      Cons:  </li>
            <li> (like, try a very light dusting of cornstarch before using).</li>
            <li> Skin is very smooth after using remover.</li>
            <li> It also leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and effective</li>
            <li> As someone who has been waxing my own legs for a couple of years, MOOM was easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The warm product wouldn&#x27;t spread easily.  </li>
            <li> how well it worked and how easy it was to keep a nice brow line.</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> Went on smooth, love the reusable fabric strips!</li>
            <li> After finishing up , I tossed the muslin strips in a sink full of warm water for about five minutes, and was happy to see that all of the Moom and hair rinsed right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion, works really best on dry, uncleaned hair and witch hazel is an awesome sensitive smoother.ooth, unsticky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion, works really best on dry, uncleaned hair and witch hazel is an awesome sensitive smoother.</li>
            <li> it smells great, easy to use, easy clean up, organic and reusable strips.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my legs, and it worked fine there with longer hair, but honestly it is easier to shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s warm and it works just fine at room temperature.    </li>
            <li> Not to mention, unless you&#x27;re a corpse your skin is warm and this thing is made mainly of sugar which liquefies even more on warm skin!</li>
            <li> just ran out but plan to order just more of the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and this is a joke.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked on bikini area better just because hairs there were thicker.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this or tell a friend about this product, I would let them know that like most \\&quot;as seen on tv \\</li>
            <li> and i m very much pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I received and am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> okay let&#x27;s not mention the fact I can&#x27;t even see my bikini area</li>
            <li> and I had much better success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing I love most about Moom is that it is all-natural</li>
            <li> -Ok</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold your skin taunt too, because it also reduces the pain.    </li>
            <li> I then started buying store brands since they were more convenient.</li>
            <li> I do recommend buying more though.</li>
            <li> This one was more successful, as I had pulled most of the wax off with the first strip.</li>
            <li> no need to buy chupa chups anymore :)</li>
            <li> I probably used more wax</li>
            <li> I guess there was one more concern</li>
            <li> Thank you Moom! :-)</li>
            <li> even thought I saw many reviewers complaining.</li>
            <li> but I hope after repeated uses it will get better.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s OK if you have more time and patience.</li>
            <li> I have tried over the counter Sallys wax products that work better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Cute</li>
            <li> + times to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a wax warmer or more sticks/strips if you wash and reuse them.  </li>
            <li> I gave Moom one more try before I trashed it and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Overall the best type of this product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I tried heating it up more....</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li> * make sure your skin is taught before pulling the strip off - if it isn&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get a lot of pain and no hair removal  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> yes, fellow noobs, it hurts, but it&#x27;s better than dealing with razor bumps and slicing up the skin.</li>
            <li> but it sure worked for a guy.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s been more than a week since I contacted them, and I&#x27;m yet to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give you plenty of washable applicators and cloth removers, which I also love.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I will ever try anything else. :)</li>
            <li> I got this like most people hoping for an alternative to wax that worked just as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wax - removes most of the hair&lt;br /&gt;Moom</li>
            <li> I found it helped to heat it up quite a bit more than the directions indicate</li>
            <li> The wax managed to get most of both.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the product is heated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it works much much better when it&#x27;s a more liquid-like consistency</li>
            <li> -Use more of a peeling motion, not a ripping motion.</li>
            <li> Its worked better on my eye brows</li>
            <li> I love Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many hair removal product at home</li>
            <li> You will also need more Moom if you intend to do your legs.  </li>
            <li> Women that don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair and don&#x27;t make mistakes with the Moom may be able to Moom more body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find I was able to use a strip twice.  </li>
            <li> The reusable strips are a plus too, since it saves me more money than buying disposable ones every time.</li>
            <li> And love that the application sticks and cloth strips are reusable</li>
            <li> The waxes I used pulled on skin more than the hair, but not this product.</li>
            <li> It did took out most of the hair, but not all.</li>
            <li> This way the hair follicles aren&#x27;t smoothed and silken by the wash and therefore the product grabs the hair more.</li>
            <li> I did it again because again it didn&#x27;t hurt so it surely didn&#x27;t pull any hair out...</li>
            <li> I guess i need more practice.</li>
            <li> Hi, I wanted to share what I thought was a better way to use this product to get results you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this helps &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> this helps &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When you evaluate 1) benefit of not having to shave as often and 2) the smoothness after using  and compare it to the pain you endure while ripping it off, I guess it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product, but</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t do its primary job, which is ripping those hairs out!  </li>
            <li> After reading through many reviews I decided to go ahead and go for it.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and tried it out last night and it worked great!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> (When I purchased this Amazon did not offer free shipping on the lavender or rose versions.)</li>
            <li> its ok i just thought it would work better based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I tried waxing my underarms, as per the instructions, and its better than my palor ... Will surely go for its refill pack s</li>
            <li> I ended up dipping the applicator sticks to the bottom and swirling the liquid from the bottom on top and using that instead.  </li>
            <li> I then tried the sally hansen al over body wax because it had the strips, which I thought would be more comfortable...better than the brazilian</li>
            <li> - I go through way too many muslin strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be able to wax my legs and bikini area about 4-5 times.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find Moom.</li>
            <li> I want to love this product..</li>
            <li> Although I love the idea of this product...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull a lot of hair out, takes practice to be able to use correctly</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also many pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> But it is definitely interesting</li>
            <li> Now I like it. :)</li>
            <li> As everyone knows, no hair removal method is perfect (there is always a \\&quot;catch\\&quot;) , but I am thinking that MOOM might be the lesser of the evils that I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay lets face it, when you pull hair out by the roots it&#x27;s gonna hurt.</li>
            <li> (I believe she actually enjoyed it, giving me pain that is)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I read that using baby powder helps the wax adhere better</li>
            <li> I totally fall in love with this Wax product, it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> but I mostly do it myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a pressure as you pull it off your skin.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;ve been waxing for years, just watch it to make sure you know how to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and so does my sister and my mother.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> It worked ok on my face and my legs.</li>
            <li> I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time.</li>
            <li> I feel like anything organic, is better than those synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li> iv every had even better then</li>
            <li> Worked great, came fast.</li>
            <li> I also love that if I get it in a spot I didn&#x27;t want to, I can just remove the product with water-unlike wax which you are stuck with once placed.</li>
            <li> Now, for the part most people probably want to hear about....</li>
            <li> I try to sit in the evenings to pluck, but more times then I care to admit</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 20 stars I would. :)</li>
            <li> Ok, a guy here.</li>
            <li> I am working out, don&#x27;t want to look like chewbacca like my father and most of my uncles.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my lovely girlfriend as she has been wanting to try waxing for some time now.</li>
            <li> and MOOM was a fantastic choice!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to give Moom a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> However, this works well for most hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love the results and plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better waxes.</li>
            <li> This product works PERFECTLY if used properly and</li>
            <li> so I am confident that I did apply the product and use it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother buying them any more.  </li>
            <li> I presume that with practice I&#x27;ll become both more timely and more graceful at \\&quot;MOOMing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waxing salon professionals always say that the more you wax, the better quality your hair will become over time.</li>
            <li> I love it but its easier to use your hand than kit&#x60;s tools</li>
            <li> I was even able to do my butt, but not without some struggle I have to admit</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> top of that</li>
            <li> My skin has never been happier :)</li>
            <li> but I wish the quantity was more.</li>
            <li> I will need some practice for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that the cloth strips are reusable.  </li>
            <li> I seriously love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it dose work</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d love to remove it all in one</li>
            <li> When you look through the reviews all you see are the five star reviews on top-</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;waxing\\&quot; kit is cute, but it&#x27;s LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than waxing tweezing or threading for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I could do it myself</li>
            <li> I am another satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> This organic wax is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face and love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Love that it washes off with water if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I find it easier to buy the prewax strips and use those as they seem to work so much better for me everytime.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some famous brands of wax before trying Moom.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll practice more</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this when there is better products out there..</li>
            <li> I was happy the pain was really reduced.</li>
            <li> When I would try and use the Moom  it would remove most of the hair</li>
            <li> My bikini line was a bit more of a challenge</li>
            <li> I am going to try IPL next, but nothing seems to be perfect yet.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I&#x27;m a strict vegan and of course organic, no honey, and no animal testing caught my attention.  </li>
            <li> Anything thats more watery wont work as well.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on most of the hair...</li>
            <li> This wax is just OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> This way the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; grabs on to the hairs and also is able to adhere to the fabric strips.</li>
            <li> As I use the \\&quot;moom\\&quot; stuff more</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve gotten better at getting the results</li>
            <li> Okay, I never write reviews for anything..</li>
            <li> I love the fact you can use the strips over and over again.  </li>
            <li> i prefer nads much more</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hopeful that as I continue the product will work more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I also really love the cloth strips that are reusable.</li>
            <li> Better on the skin though.</li>
            <li> i guess once i get used to it, it&#x27;ll be better</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love organic and washable clothes.</li>
            <li> I have never done a self waxing before so after reading reviews I though this would be okay to start.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read all of the instructions, DON&#x27;T overheat the wax, I myself haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li> so make sure you exfoliate the area</li>
            <li> This makes the wax have a more honey consistancy and it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> after and 48hr later procedure which I have perfected over time using this product and now get awesome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> best thing is that it does not damage the skin like regular wax.</li>
            <li> but i would prefer if there is more strips it would be better</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but there has to be a better way</li>
            <li> I had to go over each side three times to make sure I got it all, but I figured with practice I&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed that I did my upper lip, legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried waxing for probably 2-3 years, but this is so much better than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect that there is any better product on this planet for hair removal with this</li>
            <li> ( i made sure of it)</li>
            <li> According to the directions, it will get better each time you apply the product, THAT will never happen again.</li>
            <li> It looked more runny, OK.</li>
            <li> it works so much better.</li>
            <li> After you get the starter kit, you can re-use the cloths so ordering just the hair remover itself is even more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> I love the washable cloth strips (that I re-use each time).  </li>
            <li> so it was rather time consuming, but I was totally satisfied with the end result to not think about the time it took to get there.  </li>
            <li> I know with more practice</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a clutz.</li>
            <li> Although it took me many intents.</li>
            <li> But if I let the hair grow out a bit, this works like magic.</li>
            <li> I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to get any better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to lay it in the direction of the hair to be removed, then lay the strip over it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I felt like I was competing with my husband on the mustache thing :).  </li>
            <li> I would give this more stars if possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency would be great for grabbing hold of very stubborn hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was in love.</li>
            <li> anyways, I shave most of my hair.</li>
            <li> stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li> If it lasts for more than a day, I&#x27;m not going to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I think it worked as my face felt better.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull all hair, but is okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> worked okay ..</li>
            <li> good part is it is easy clean up</li>
            <li> and it does work for the most part (not as well on stubborn bikini hairs though)</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I thought I might get better with practice.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is lovely.</li>
            <li> The thinner you spread this stuff the better results you will have.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of home waxes over the last decade and this is the best.</li>
            <li> After some practice the next time I went to use it it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I go after at a time the better it is removed...</li>
            <li> More than.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase and really works.</li>
            <li> I love that the clothes are reusable and the sticks were included as well.</li>
            <li> I love that is it organic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just wished it would pick up more hair.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that its organic (and that is important) and the wax is soft on the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> I think this helped make sure that most of the hairs came off.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m so glad I found Moom.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff almost pain free so much better then wax</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> More quantity.</li>
            <li> i experienced some irritation but it cleared right up after applying some thayers witch hazel (alcohol free).  </li>
            <li> however I am very familiar with waxing as I have been doing it forever.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s natural (which was the best part, honestly).</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use it</li>
            <li> Plus, I love that it is made of environmentally friendly products - even the strips are reusable!</li>
            <li> This is a nice advantage over waxes, which require baby oil or wax removal products to clean.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was in love with this product, but as time went on, while Moom is good on the face, it seemed to give me underarm pimples.</li>
            <li> All you need is warm water and soap to clean Moom off your skin, the reusable cloth strips, and any surface where it might have dripped.</li>
            <li> They rinsed completely clean after soaking in warm water.  </li>
            <li> You may think that the muslin strips will not be reusable, but they rinse out clean under warm water.</li>
            <li> I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!</li>
            <li> This is superb for bikini area waxing, that&#x27;s pretty much all</li>
            <li> Moom is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Those methods are fine for most areas, but far from ideal for for others.</li>
            <li> am willing to pay any amount of money for good products...</li>
            <li> , so I tried this stuff on my legs first and even though it didn&#x27;t rip all the hair out, it got a good amount.</li>
            <li> Which wasn&#x27;t that surprising to me, as I read the manual, followed the directions exactly and got the results the product promised.</li>
            <li> But lo and behold, my first time results were as good as professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it worked pretty good, though like I said I&#x27;ll need some practice, so</li>
            <li> the first couple of pages) thinking that this would be good, so i ordered it, As soon as i got</li>
            <li> An absolute MUST HAVE for anyone wanting to do their own waxing!</li>
            <li> Moom sounded too good to be true - cloths you clean and reuse?</li>
            <li> ... useful, nice and pleasant ;)&lt;br /&gt;... and tasty as well...</li>
            <li> well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was able to wash off easily, and I had set the jar on the side of my sink, where the bottom had some on it, creating a ring that stuck to the sink.</li>
            <li> I was able to wash off easily, and I had set the jar on the side of my sink, where the bottom had some on it, creating a ring that stuck to the sink.</li>
            <li> I love that the strips are reusable, and that the residue washed off easily off of my skin and the strips.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and stays warm.</li>
            <li> Wash face, dry, use the cornstarch and the best time is before bed.</li>
            <li> I always use Moom, it&#x27;s amazing and works super well.</li>
            <li> You can always remove more hair, you can&#x27;t replace it once it&#x27;s gone nearly as easily</li>
            <li> The great part about it is that, since it&#x27;s sugar, it washes off anything simply with warm water.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the nice smell, the reuasble strips, and the easy clean up, however I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> There were plenty of cloth strips included, and they were very easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li> I love how effect the waxing is and how easy it is to clean up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to heat with the glass jar and super easy to clean both my skin after use and the cloth strips, just use warm water, no soap needed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> But if you do as the booklet says and wait 2 weeks after shaving an area, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this product&#x27;s efficacy varies from person to person depending on method of use, as well as skin and hair type, but for me it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> It washes away easily with warm water and the reusable strips are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I started on an area with very light, fine hair to test for easy removal.</li>
            <li> ...how very cool is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  -If you decide to warm up the wax by letting it float in hot water, make sure to put the Moom jar in the container, then fill the container up with water.</li>
            <li> The stuff works and its a great, natural product.  </li>
            <li> It works great and barely hurts :-).  </li>
            <li> I bought a box of tongue depressors here on amazon (really cheap for 500 in a box), and i find them to be a better applicator than the skinny sticks...</li>
            <li> That is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy this is an all natural product and comes with these reusable cloths.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Most importantly I applied baby powder before applying the sugaring.  </li>
            <li> , this was the best $17 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> but it would have been more helpful with detailed instructions for people who have never used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, like myself.  </li>
            <li> I left there in incredible pain that didn&#x27;t go away for almost a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable to do at home, plus it allows your spouse to inflict pain upon you.  </li>
            <li> As far as wax goes, the product seems great.</li>
            <li> I was nervous trying it at first because of some of the one-star reviews, but I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> One day I ordered this Moom Hair Removal because I needed to order some more to get \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; ordering online.  </li>
            <li> Shaving has never been ideal for me, especially in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY DO 20 SEC TO ME THAT PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Everything else about the product is good for a reasonably priced at-home kit.</li>
            <li> it is worth a try and a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Now, I can manscape the whole area in about 20 minutes and it stays good for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up!</li>
            <li> This product is great, easy to use and not a messy cleanup.</li>
            <li> It removes hair very effectively, quickly, and most importantly PAINLESSLY!</li>
            <li> and theres no mess, which is great for skin and bathroom.</li>
            <li> tried to make my own sugar at home and it wasn&#x27;t the right consistency</li>
            <li> I had to heat it a just a bit because right out of the container it wouldn&#x27;t spread at all, but heated just a bit it spread nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) Definitly have it sitting in some sort of warm water bath to keep it the right temperature.</li>
            <li> Much lowere than most products in the store and works better to boot!</li>
            <li> I ordered thinking it was going to be great because all the reviews seemed real and honest and made it sound like it really worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy after you get practice, the wax washes right off the strips and body with warm water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly familiar with most kinds of hair removal: shaving, waxing, epilating, laser.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that I believe this is an excellent product, and I have recommended it to friends that have issues with some of the other types of hair removers.  </li>
            <li> just did bikini area for a patch test, gonna try and tackle a full Brazilian ASAP!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also my first time using any sort of wax product, and I can say without a doubt, I&#x27;m glad it was this!</li>
            <li> Since I am familiar with the waxing process (have tried waxing on legs, underarms etc as well as the experience of having it done so many times)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> but I really liked this product, it is natural and I love the easy to use directions!  </li>
            <li> Moom went on easily and cleaned up just as easily.</li>
            <li> Product easily washes away with water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was wonderfully easy</li>
            <li> This was wonderfully easy</li>
            <li> I do love that it is so easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> so I let my hair grow which wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easily removes hair with no pain at all.</li>

            <li> It is very quick to heat up and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The goal is to make Moom easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> and how the strips are easily washed and reused.     </li>
            <li> am most happy with the muslin cloths, especially since they&#x27;re washable, which means that you don&#x27;t have to throw them away and replace them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it gets cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li> The fabric strips were easy to grab and there are plenty of them.</li>
            <li> And the clean-up was so easy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am really happy with MOOM :-)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to do it yourself and a ton cheaper.</li>
            <li> I find it to be convenient and an easy to use alternative to going to the salon.</li>
            <li> MOOM is easy to heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easy to remove excess sugar with damp washrag</li>
            <li> and I easily get sweaty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do.  </li>
            <li> Easy to spread with the sticks</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face, and it was sooooo easy.  </li>
            <li> Plus the wax in the jar gets thicken very quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought it hadn&#x27;t pulled the hair out), easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how easy, and well this product worked.</li>
            <li> The wax does not come off easily either,it was literally stuck on my leg, i had to keep washing it off</li>
            <li> Was hoping this product would actually be easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The wax comes off fairly easily.</li>
            <li> was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> And it is so incredibly easy.</li>
            <li> Room temperature was not sufficient for spreading easily on the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strips and sticks are easily cleaned</li>
            <li> I like the review the says it is easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something that works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> However, it was so easy to work with.</li>
            <li> is easy to apply, almost too easy.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars for the nice strips and super easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Easy to heat</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good; it&#x27;s true that it does not give a chemical burn like some others</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all like wax, probably because it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of grip.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of messy and can be kind of stringy, but it cleans up very easily with just warm water.      </li>
            <li> I liked the smell and it was pretty easy to heat up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> For a first timer, this product is simply effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The wax is removed with just warm or hot water and the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I found it almost painless after a couple drinks.  ;)</li>
            <li> First time users will need a microwave or some way to warm the Moom; a towel, a bowl with soapy water; a wash cloth; and paper towels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily (warm tap water or handsoap &amp; water!).  </li>
            <li> I like the glass jar, so after heating it in the microwave you can place it in a bowl of hot water to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> time around I warmed it for 20 seconds at a time which made it really nice and runny so that, while hot (manageable for me)</li>
            <li> So easy to take off, and it came in the mail rather quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash off with water since it&#x27;s sugar-based and super inexpensive!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant, light scent and even though I am inexperienced, I waxed both my arms in 30 minutes (with also reading the directions).</li>
            <li> :) It was not painful at all...it leaves the skin smooth too.</li>
            <li> the was longer than 1/2&amp;#34; but it worked fine on my 3/4&amp;#34; leg hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that this would be a great product for upkeep but</li>
            <li> the hairs that I do have are extremely fine.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pain free and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> , the strips (like most strips) get frayed after first use, and got more frayed when I washed them</li>
            <li> but if you read the directions it should work fine.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and this should be a the perfect hair to grad with wax.</li>
            <li> Remove about 50 -  60% of my fine leg hair.    </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t grab onto the fine hair.</li>
            <li> remove fine hairs</li>
            <li> The first time I used moom, I didn&#x27;t necessarily follow the step by step directions and hair removal was spotty at best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be razor free!</li>
            <li> Easy steps, not hugely painful and clean up was a breeze!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even made my own sugar wax at home (which worked great the first batch but ripped off a layer of skin with the second batch)..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to get off the skin.    </li>
            <li> Best ever, yes a bit messy but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I especially love that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off any excess or misplaced \\&quot;wax\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Its Easy, relatively painless and great value for money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 5 years and it continues to be easy to use and worth its price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This works great and easy (relatively) to use.</li>
            <li> The clean up is easy because once the wax hardens it&#x27;s not sticky and easily peels off any surface.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews for MOOM before purchasing and was pleased that there were so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This sugar wax is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, easy to remove (with water!)</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the reviewers: Easy to apply, easy to clean up, and (for me anyway) virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean up, and I love that the muslin strips are washable and reusable.</li>
            <li> I love that it is super easy to clean up if I get it on anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed, in fact I am extremely pleased and would recommend this to anybody interested in being waxed.a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to recieve this in the mail because I had read so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more satisfied with other products, like GiGi Strip Free Wax, which is easy to use and much more effective.</li>
            <li> HUGE BUMMER.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would save time to apply a huge section and take it off in sections.</li>
            <li> easy clean up Semi pain free.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like reusing the strips, which you can because they clean up easily with warm water, but it grosses me out.  </li>
            <li> Easy clean up with water if you get it on something you shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even the strips were amazingly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks Moon for including all the tools I need in the kit and for effective use at room temperature.</li>
            <li> 100% hair free</li>
            <li> Great for my upper lip and bikini line!</li>
            <li> and this is SO EASY to clean up.</li>
            <li> But, overall, a great waxing product.</li>
            <li> Moom does clean up easily.</li>
            <li> Moom does clean up easily.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that not only did this product stand up to</li>
            <li> This product is water soluble and washes away clean and easily, with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> The strips also rinse clean incredibly easily.       </li>
            <li> It is also important to mention how fantastic the instructions are.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and for a newbie to waxing, I did not feel any pain.</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a shot and have smooth, hairless legs.    </li>
            <li> I used 5 of the 10 wax strips and they were filled with hair.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> The wax strips and sticks run out faster than the wax, but you can get those anywhere relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> It was easy to clean up and easy to clean the cloths strips that it came with</li>
            <li> For a girl who has dealt with semi-sensitive skin all my life, this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative than using one&#x27;s gas to drive to a beautician to do the job that will charge around the same price for this product for one visit.  </li>
            <li> Now I have comfortable feet</li>
            <li> I am a cheap, do-it-yourself type.</li>
            <li> But Moom is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I guess I read all the reviews that made this sound dreamy.</li>
            <li> I and its gentle and effective</li>
            <li> have used MOOM on my underarm, bikini and legs with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean off from my skin, the cloths and the applicator.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews here, I decided to be brave and try the Moom kit, and am definitely a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean up off your skin and the fabric is reuseable.</li>
            <li> My legs looked smooth but did not feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Sticky, messy, but nonetheless awesome!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great, and you can use i to get rid of hair of different areas.</li>
            <li> I like that the clean up is so easy and that the strips can be reused.</li>
            <li> But it does make my skin smooth after waxing.</li>
            <li> I thought why not try this wax since it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It does clean up easily</li>
            <li> I recommend picking up a cheap coaster-style candle warmer to go with your kit.  </li>
            <li> Moom is organic, with sugar (that is warmed) being the primary ingredient.  </li>
            <li> if you are considering Moom just go for it and be willing to play until you get a suitable method for you.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, and got smooth skin, but no hair removal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda messy getting it out of the jar, but I&#x27;m sure those of you who are more experienced or coordinated won&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> Smooth exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> Also it was extremely easy to clean</li>
            <li> This product is also great for 1st time users because if you get it on your clothes, furniture, or excess amount on your skin it simply rinses off.  </li>
            <li> This product would be much more useful if it came as pre-treated strips to be applied out of box.</li>
            <li> I think for someone who&#x27;s had lots of experience with waxing would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this item has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Depilatory creams are also filled with chemicals and I am all about the naturals for my body.</li>
            <li> The price is great too, especially when you consider everything that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Today is the week mark of using moom and legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li> It gets three stars because it was easy to clean up and spread on, and after a week, it still feels like 12 hour growth.</li>
            <li> The sticks and fabrics bits are easy to clean, just use soap and water and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moom</li>
            <li> It worked and it was pain free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better and more gentle.</li>
            <li> I went in search of something more natural and effective and ordered Moom based on the customer reviews.</li>
            <li> You do have to have the technique, but I am far from a professional and the product worked great for me!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews and because it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and have used this product, its a good buy..</li>
            <li> The hair took a fair amount of time to return, (thank you all things GOOD and SWEET!), but I&#x27;m not sure I would venture to use this one again.</li>
            <li> The hair took a fair amount of time to return, (thank you all things GOOD and SWEET!), but I&#x27;m not sure I would venture to use this one again.</li>
            <li> As the title says I was very excited to try this product, and really wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it was very easy to use and more importantly, the clean up was easy too!</li>
            <li> NOT try this for the 1st time right before anything sexy or important.</li>
            <li> NOT try this for the 1st time right before anything sexy or important.</li>
            <li> * make sure you&#x27;re hair is in the right length</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that I was able to rinse off the fabric strips with tap water and they were clean and ready to be reused after drying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, because we all read the reviews and have to take the most popular statements and decide to go for the purchase or not.&lt;br /&gt;These reviews seem plausible, but truth be told I was able to get maybe 50% of the hair after the second try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine others will have to deal with this quite the same way I do, but you may find your hands get sticky and the damp wash cloth will be very handy.</li>
            <li> that was very useful.      </li>
            <li> Plus, the cloths really do rinse clean with warm water, just like advertised.     </li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this to everyone:):)</li>
            <li> It leaves it smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically pain free and super easy to clean up after.</li>
            <li> smooth and clean</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be magically hair free the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to do.</li>
            <li> And it washed off super easily.</li>
            <li> Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini</li>
            <li> Sugar based product washed off super easy with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It cools quickly, and heats too hot very easily, so once you get it to that temperature that&#x27;s needed, keep it there</li>
            <li> It would be best to warm the Moom less, because your device that you use to warm the Moom may be more powerful - therefore needing less warming time.  </li>
            <li> It sounded good, looked easy enough...</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well ( after a first try,) safe for my skin, and should last a good while.</li>
            <li> The original package I got of Moom came with some strips to use to remove the product when pulling out the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed, in fact I am extremely pleased and would recommend this to anybody interested in being waxed.</li>
            <li> I have used original Moom Wax in the past, which worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is way better than wax and on my first eyebrow</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Maybe a set of friendly helping hands would have worked, too.  </li>
            <li> Simple and effective!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s economical!</li>
            <li> I think a rookie waxer may have issues using this product, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing or willing to take your time to learn how to use the product (trial and error or YouTube tutorials), you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it, I got my first sugar waxing at Shobha in DC.  </li>
            <li> think hair removal was better the first time when I did not microwave the stuff.</li>
            <li> i was veery excited to try the moom hair removal after reading the reviews , when i tried it ( and i was comparing it to nads hair removal gel)  </li>
            <li> better than waxing and shaving, i never waxed or shaved and Moom is my first hair removal method</li>
            <li> and I too was so excited to use it that ones i started</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the product stated regrowth wouldn&#x27;t return until 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product, but I tried it and didnt work, NOT</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s cruelity free and natural makes it even better!</li>
            <li> and I think I follow the directions exactly but was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any sugar or waxing product, so I did have some missed hairs/broken hairs, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just user error and won&#x27;t be an issue with some practice.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to do this.</li>
            <li> I really love this wax, its easy to apply with the wooden applicators and it works very well with the strips that came along with it, even better than the strips can be reused just but rinsing it under warm water and letting it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on your skin and washes right off with warm water, do it is super easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have had some experience doing my own waxing at home, so i wanted to try something new,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely new to this kind of wax</li>
            <li> It took me around 20 minutes to clean off 4 strips.    </li>
            <li> and my guess is that it will take about 20 minutes, including having to clean up from body jerks into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my guess is that it will take about 20 minutes, including having to clean up from body jerks into the product.    </li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel smooth and soft afterward, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give instruction on how to clean the strips</li>
            <li> I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li> I can find it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water.</li>
            <li> Everything washed clean and is drying now.</li>
            <li> You can clean the strips though -</li>
            <li> And the clean up is a breeze compared to wax, this product can be rinsed off with water...</li>
            <li> so clean up</li>
            <li> Doing some research, I discovered that sugaring is waxing&#x27;s nice cousin and felt it would be better for my skin than regular waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about waxing may still use it because it is so effective, but they don&#x27;t especially appreciate the pain.  </li>
            <li> you can clean and reuse the strips (after drying) which i needed to do to before i was done.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome (just be careful not to heat it too much)</li>
            <li> So on my next pot I found a better option, I run the warm water into the sink and let the pot sit in the water for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was still able to almost perfectly spread it paper thin and do the rest as instructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but because I need to do it regularly I thought I&#x27;d try to find a more cost effective solution.</li>
            <li> instead of oil, water is all it takes to clean up.</li>
            <li> to clean up&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, and while it was undeniably easier to clean up, when I pulled off the strip</li>
            <li> &quot; So with that said, if you have a quiet, well-lit location with no children and you are not 7 months pregnant, you will probably love this product more and it will work even better for you.</li>
            <li> And that its all natural, even better!</li>
            <li> But for small, quick, hair removal, Moom is perfect.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this is that it is such easy clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to heat up and apply (if you have it at the right temperature).</li>
            <li> you had to use their special cleaning cloths, and 2.</li>
            <li> nothing particularly special</li>
            <li> An organic hair removal product with reusable applicators is right up my crunchy granola alley!  </li>
            <li> It looks great this time, with minimal redness and almost no stray hairs, and feels clean and cool.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited when I did my bikini area since it did hurt</li>
            <li> Now with my wedding a month away I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty experienced with all types of hair removal, especially waxing.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse hair, which it isn&#x27;t great at removing when the hair is stubbly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Moom starter kit, it had everything I needed and really made my first foray into the world of self-waxing easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After letting it cool, it just made my hair sticky - think lollipop and would not come off on the strip.</li>
            <li> I washed all the strips and they are good to go for my next hair removal session.</li>
            <li> I love that the linen strips are reusable, and compared to salon prices, the refill jars are very affordable.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin nice and soft and it works, but it does take longer to use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love MOOM so much.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m getting the whole kit again because i need more strips but</li>
            <li> I really liked that you can wash the cloths and it is not messy at all... &lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I love Moom so much?</li>
            <li> Each time there are a good amount of hairs left over that I have to pluck.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so not painful at all, and</li>
            <li> Soft, works, heat up just a tad or put container in warm water.  </li>
            <li> I did and found that to be true.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% pain free, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any at all-the jar still looks full.</li>
            <li> not so much :).....</li>
            <li> clean up was quick, just took water..</li>
            <li> But ants really like it, so make sure you keep it in a ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li> :) She has used the whole 6-ounce jar, which took around a month to use.</li>
            <li> Then, if you allow it to cool, it won&#x27;t spread, but it will grab your hairs and start pulling them immediately.  </li>
            <li> The directions in the package as well as the instructional video online are very helpful and made my hair removal even more thorough.</li>
            <li> I used to have my upper lip waxed a few times a year, but now I do my own at home with the greatest of ease with Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I let it cool off for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this product at home late one night while in bed (I know, not the best set up).      </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin and seems to cool off before you can even get it applied.</li>
            <li> Moom feels fresh and smooth after the job is done.</li>
            <li> I waited until my hairs were the full 1 cm (as recommended).  </li>
            <li> It is not painful and even gets easier each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> only used this once &amp; it seems to work good.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> or you applied to much and realize you won&#x27;t be able to remove the hair you can just remove it and do it again.</li>
            <li> &quot; ingredients also got me convinced and truely,</li>
            <li> It gets more hair in one go, it&#x27;s easier to work with, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> On top of it its organic, highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Move it to an airtight container and let it cool.</li>
            <li> This is true for any method of hit waxing: hair length should not exceed 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not painful at all.</li>
            <li> full of bs...</li>
            <li> I have only, used this once, but I bet once I get good at it</li>
            <li> I found a strip full of moom, and all the hair still on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this would be something good to use for those gross, stray chin hairs you sometimes get.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product after seeing how much the reviews varied on it, but I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product - could use that temperature gauge thingy though.</li>
            <li> Package IS NOT BAD  </li>
            <li> other reviews say that doing large areas at a time give the best success, but I have to disagree</li>
            <li> I put the fabric over, and pulled, only to end up with it coming off like you&#x27;re pulling perfectly prepared pizza slices complete with just the right amount of cheese.</li>
            <li> Clean up on skin, bathroom surfaces, and clothes is super easy with hot water.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the reviews stating that they had minimal redness, easy clean-up and good results.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the reviews stating that they had minimal redness, easy clean-up and good results.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> , this wax is most effective on hair that has grown off for some-time, not newly shaved or plucked-off hair.     </li>
            <li> Take it easy on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to remove in the shower and comes off with just hot water.</li>
            <li> My first challenge was keeping the wax warm enough for me to be able to spread, which of course is a challenge for me anyways.</li>
            <li> Because I have such coarse hair, I was very sure waxing would hurt like hell even though I&#x27;m a good bearer of pain.</li>
            <li> this most recent session, I washed my face in warm water (to loosen up the pores and their grip on the hairs) and mild Dove soap first.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say this at the very end, but it can be easily missed as I just threw out my original batch of cloth.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions to detail, you will get great results with very minimal pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> There is less pain, it smells good, it isn&#x27;t as sticky and it is SUPER easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions on heating - substance is sticky but works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the redness faded quickly after the hair removal.</li>
            <li> Not only was it easy, it was kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Nice work, Moom, and thanks so much for making this product so affordable as well.</li>
            <li> - 100% ORGANIC, Reusable Muslin cloths, convenient wooden spatulas, leaves skin silky smooth, no irritation, can be used warm or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> And I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy more cloth strips, but can actually wash/re-use them!</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, and that everything needed is included, and the price is fantastic, but it does take a while to learn how to use correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I wish I would have ordered more then just 6 oz and more strips just not enough for my hairy legs.</li>
            <li> and then I realized why the directions said to do it quickly.</li>
            <li> It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice.</li>
            <li> am a white female with semi-coarse leg hair, so maybe its best for people with thinner leg hair.</li>
            <li> I can proudly say that, thanks to Moom, I will finally get to experience all the benefits that long-term, dedicated waxing can bring.</li>
            <li> With this wax the redness wears off quickly and no breakouts afterwards.</li>
            <li> Nads is SUPER sticky- even when you heat it up.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to spend extra money buying more and more strips.</li>
            <li> I bought 50 extra strips which I&#x27;m glad I bought as I&#x27;ll need more for legs and under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> OK so first off, this is my first time ever waxing or sugar waxing.</li>
            <li> The jar of wax included in this kit has lasted me: 2 brazillians, 1 lip, 1 toes/feet, and 3 pregnant belly waxings.</li>
            <li> Results are quick, and</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, it is super-effective and VERY easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its so much easier to clean anddd!</li>
            <li> It smells sweet, heats up fast, goes on easy</li>
            <li> Since it was so cheap, it was hard not to give it a try after so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and can be diffcult because it is better used when its very warm and doesnt stay warm for very long</li>
            <li> What I like the most about this is that it is such easy clean up when you are finished</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very pleased with the results on my upper lip</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is a good choice, though if you have a low pain tolerance this is slightly better than wax choices, still get a numbing creme too.</li>
            <li> It is indeed a bit messy, but I found it the most effective when heated to a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> The English is clear, the procedures are easy, and there are tips to help you have a successful experience</li>
            <li> The wax also wipes off really well with some warm water, so it was easy to clean my body, hands, sticks, and strips for next time.</li>
            <li> Really - it smells like sweet honey!  </li>
            <li> There are recipes on how to make this stuff all over the Web; however, I&#x27;m thrilled with buying Moom instead of making my own sugar wax, even though I am usually a DIY-er.</li>
            <li> I spread the sugaring solution MUCH thinner than I ever would have thought to do on my own, and I reuse areas of the same strip (without adding more product) by pressing it back against my skin and rubbing quickly to warm it up, then cooling and removing again.  </li>
            <li> This Moom - was so much easier because it is easy to get off with water and reapply.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely aware of it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think id ever get the wax off &amp; that was using hot water &amp; soap!</li>
            <li> It really works for me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my face waxed for years and it was so embarrassing to go into a salon and have people point out how much hair they had pulled off of my face!!</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some time to perfect the technique, particularly if you have never waxed before, and it can get pretty messy, but the good news is that it is quite easy to clean up with water, and I found the result of all the hard work to be much more satisfying than shaving.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally lick your lips and get a bit of it in your system, it&#x27;s awesome to know that you aren&#x27;t ingesting noxious chemicals, but rather a fairly natural compound that will do less harm than eating a bite of a sugary dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were a soft muslin cloth and were easy to smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is for some reason the product did not work on my leg hair as well (like 30% effective at best), though my leg hair is fine and blonde, whereas my armpit and bikini hair is coarser and dark.  </li>
            <li> so it is very easy to clean up (although a bit messier initially).  </li>
            <li> It is easier to clean up, very easy, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Third, it was very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> - Clean up is so easy - just use hot water or a warm wet towel.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face, it took some of the fine hair off but not the really corsed ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this product many ways, in microwave, room temp, clean skin, semi clean skin, short regrowth, suggested regrowth, etc...</li>
            <li> After a couple of practice strips I found this product to be easy to use, easy to clean up, and effecient (even on my stubborn asian hair).  </li>
            <li> for this product, i recently used it for eye brows and upper lip (both areas were fine hairs) but the wax was not that effective on the new short hairs that grew on the eyebrows (lol!)</li>
            <li> The little booklet with directions is great too.</li>
            <li> Came right off, some discomfort but overall many times easier than waxing!  </li>
            <li> I had basically resigned myself to the shaving method until recently I felt adventurous again and decided it would be nice to wax the rest of my body myself instead of getting it professionally</li>
            <li> This product works fabulously and is very well priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not that messy and the strips clean easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Great product just really messy</li>
            <li> Its a learning curve but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve gotten more than $200 of salon priced removal out of it, i dont mind if when i get towards the bottom of the jar i need to spend another $20 on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love natural products but this one just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Moom is by far better at removing hair than anything I&#x27;ve bought from the store.</li>
            <li> No irritation or chemical burns from the sugar, even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup...</li>
            <li> claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup...</li>
            <li> If you still see hairs, smooth on a bit more baby powder and the next strip will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am thrilled with this product for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to spread when it&#x27;s not heated, but it&#x27;s better to do &#x27;sweat spots&#x27; without heating it, or I&#x27;m sure you could use the powder suggested in the video</li>
            <li> This stuff just wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money for me, even if it did remove my hair.</li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s worth it because no stubby regrowth.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is nice.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural, too.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon even though I shop here all the time, but this product works.</li>
            <li> but i have to go over spots many times before hair is almost completely removed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can use some strips of natural undyed cotton in addition to the ones they give you, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was actually fun to do this</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest trying to keep the protective seal handy</li>
            <li> I love how washable this is and how it leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> wow magic.........................</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth it for anyone to try.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t immediately have success-</li>
            <li> But given the cost, I think in future I will reuse the Moom jar and supplies and just DIY my own sugar wax.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the rate of regrowth, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied with the process and the results</li>
            <li> Underarms: 2 weeks worth of underarm hair.</li>
            <li> I was SURPRISED and PLEASED.    </li>
            <li> As it is advertised, it is all natural (and therefore healthier for your skin) and is easy to clean up as it is sugar based.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be ok on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it worked well and didn&#x27;t cause irritation like most wax does for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have someone you really want to see your most intimate parts, and that, for me is not going to happen..</li>
            <li> I love how this is not messy and it rinses off with water.</li>
            <li> I just wish she wouldn&#x27;t laugh at me as she does it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I actually like the cheap sugar waxing kit I bought at Walmart better.</li>
            <li> I tried spreading the product on the strip and it is easier to use, but when I applied directly on the skin it removed way better.</li>
            <li> I got such great results, and I&#x27;m probably more inexperienced at hair removal than most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> almost perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;The key to using Moom is to find your own &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34; with it.  </li>
            <li> either way, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money for getting my legs done.</li>
            <li> I feel more environmentally conscious than throwing away a bunch of strips with my hair on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the upside, however, I only had to shave 1 leg for about 3 weeks, which was nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, so I bought it and &#x27;hoped&#x27; it would work out for me to tidy up my brows and such between visits.</li>
            <li> You can hand me any kind of lotion for red bumps and mine will still be there.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my friend did and she had a lot of success with it.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money</li>
            <li> The hair removal is extremely effective when done properly.</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s natural products.</li>
            <li> I liked it and my next purchase will also be Moom Organic.</li>
            <li> but I always had to go back over it with another kind of wax.</li>
            <li> I first tried it on my arms, where the hair is much stronger then on the legs (which I used to shave or epilate) and I was amazed to see the hair being removed so easy.</li>
            <li> The added bonus is that it smells and tastes good, and it is more natural than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The original applicators definitely do the job, but toothpicks allow for a bit more accuracy, and you can just discard them instead of washing at the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Middle Eastern originally, and have been using sugar wax most of my life to remove hair, however it&#x27;s always easier when someone does the waxing for you, as when you do it alone</li>
            <li> , I LOVE IT, EASY TO USE, BE CAREFUL IT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li> overall i&#x27;m very pleased with this product, especially because the hair comes out easier the more you use it.</li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s the good news, unlike other wax products this one does not hurt..  </li>
            <li> I had no problems using this kit and it is good if you want to be quick without leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> so it washes right off.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and could tell right away that the product worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li> (the water takes the wax right off)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> you can buy a beard/bikini trimmer to uniformly trim the hair to the right length.  </li>
            <li> right before pulling it off - this helps with adhesion  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my right leg</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not using it right or something.</li>
            <li> I heated the product over the stove and had an issue getting everything to the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> Have whomever is doing it read and UNDERSTAND all the directions before they start, and remember if it doesn&#x27;t hurt they&#x27;re not doing it right.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> maybe i did not do it right</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t use the right technique you can break the hair off rather than remove it from the root.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions over and over and did it the right way...</li>
            <li> (mine were...originally) it does rip the scab right off.</li>
            <li> took me awhile to get it right</li>
            <li> Washed right off and doesn&#x27;t remove any skin layers...</li>
            <li> it washed right off with just water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it until the consistency is right (like honey) so that you can spread it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff hurts, unless I&#x27;m not pulling it right.</li>
            <li> I had never waxed before and wanted to get the right product for me.</li>
            <li> but it really does come off clean.</li>
            <li> Clean up is much MUCH quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li> MOOM is relatively cost effective because the spatulas and strips are reusable (just wash them with hot water).</li>
            <li> It works perfect for my dark, coarse hair on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> This kit is not as much effective as a regular wax, but it is SOOOO much nicer to use it!</li>
            <li> I learned that I would probably have been better off leaving it to a professional, being that this was the first time I&#x27;ve waxed</li>
            <li> so it is much much much easier to clean up than wax.</li>
            <li> I am going to put it in a bowl of hot water next time to try keeping it warm</li>
            <li> I will not buy again, but I looked online and this stuff is actually very easy to make yourself with simple household ingredients.</li>
            <li> Second, it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First off, when I first got this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get much hair off though, I think the strips are good only for the bikini line, underarm, or facial hair</li>
            <li> Not only did it deliver effective results on \\&quot;all\\&quot; areas of my body, but once I got the hang of using the product, my skin was left smooth, hairless, and pain free.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to make a lot more for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for smooth and easy waxing</li>
            <li> carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to take the fine hair off my upper lip, and my fine chin hair, some peach-fuzz across the sides of my face, and define my eyebrow line.</li>
            <li> After four uses total, we still have half a jar of wax and the washed strips hold up perfectly.</li>
            <li> It ultimately removed about half the hairs, at best.</li>
            <li> A six or seven dollar box of wax strips would last a month or two if I was lucky, so this is a much better bargain.</li>
            <li> I had tried the Parissa before, and while it was okay, my hair grew back quickly.</li>
            <li> Even though the directions say to apply the MOOM in the direction of the hair growth and pull the muslin strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth, I found it&#x27;s more effective if I MOOM several times in both directions.</li>
            <li> , I went online to watch the instructional video, and saw that I should maybe use a bit more MOOM than the barely visible layer I has been applying.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve raised the price on this product since I first bought it, but I think it&#x27;s still worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to be hair free for a few weeks whilst on my jollies and the good reviews convinced me to give it a go.</li>
            <li> This kit is so professional: everything is neat and tidy, no mess for me, stores neatly, beautifully packaged, and enough sugar wax and strips to last me for years.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try if your hair is fine maybe and your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not painful like normal wax!</li>
            <li> The first time I did this, it took about an hour to get it right.</li>
            <li> really love the fact that it washes right off with warm water, the cloth strips are re-usable, and this product seems to last for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I figured Moom would be no different, but decided to buy it because I was looking for a natural product and there were such great reviews (no pain, easy clean-up, etc.).</li>
            <li> Waxing does hurt, but not THAT bad, and this is for sure the best way to go.</li>
            <li> This barely hurts and the organic stuff actually smells nice!  </li>
            <li> i have never done waxing by myself at all - but this product was easy on the skin, the wax need only medium warming (no need to really heat), and the wax is easy to wash-off, it comes with cloth-strips that are washable for re-use.    </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while it has \\&quot;tee tree\\&quot; in it, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily and completely natural.</li>
            <li> This wax was also easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It heated in no time, went on easy and was nearly painless.  </li>
            <li> Great products will defintely come back here again in the future and i recommend this products.</li>
            <li> Loved the fact that it is natural just wish it actually worked.</li>
            <li> So I very recently in my adult life learned how easy it is to wax at home.</li>
            <li> In fact it leaves my face silky smooth and very soft, and I&#x27;m already finding the grow-back time to be lengthening.  </li>
            <li> Now, though, it&#x27;s simple, quick, and clean!</li>
            <li> you are someone who is experienced with wax it doesn&#x27;t mean you are going to have a 100% success with Moom, you have to adjust to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although today, my left leg (the waxed leg) is more tender than the right</li>
            <li> First time, right out of the jar - worked like a charm, removed hair exactly as is should.  </li>
            <li> I either run everything under hot water or let it sit in a pot of hot water for a bit, and it all washes right</li>
            <li> I was also a bit concerned, this being my first time, and I&#x27;ve never even been professionally waxed, but I found the instructions to be very adequate and the process simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does remove your facial hair just fine with no skin attached!    </li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> and my skin is very smooth, no red spots or any hair...</li>
            <li> I very much prefer the cocojo sugar wax.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burning feeling.</li>
            <li> Although it was very fast shipping..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great tip to heed is to make sure you are applying a very thin layer to your skin,</li>
            <li> The toothpicks were just the size I needed to direct the sugar over my fine eyebrow hairs.     </li>
            <li> This product, however-- was easy, not messy, and my under arms are smooth and clear looking.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair removal kit I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and other areas, great for sensitive areas but in my opinion, NOT FOR A BRAZILIAN WAX.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very pleased, but like other people said it doesn&#x27;t get out all the hair on the first time</li>
            <li> Great organic wax that somehow doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other waxes, even professional waxes.</li>
            <li> I simply fill my sink up with warm water and stick the strips in as I&#x27;m done using them, along with the wooden applicators, and ALL the wax dissolves easily.</li>
            <li> When you are wearing work shoes and uniforms for a good portion of your day, every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> by the third time the hair comes out really easily and the pain level is non-existent to mild, depending on the area.</li>
            <li> got none of the fuzz on my face, which I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about because they are pretty fine.</li>
            <li> It is indeed very gentle on skin, and putting the product on hot in...</li>
            <li> However, I watched the video and did it EXACTLY as the directions in the box said, so I&#x27;m positive I was doing it right.    </li>
            <li> I nuked it according to instructions and still too hot.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what exactly this was.</li>
            <li> My first time using this product on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> It cleans most of the area up well leaving you to pluck the smaller hairs.    </li>
            <li> I am 100% female :)</li>
            <li> I threw the jar out after the first attempt.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up with soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using a loofa to make sure when the hair starts coming back that it doesn&#x27;t grow under the skin.  </li>
            <li> Most women have tried various hair removal products over the years.</li>
            <li> have to say this product does EXACTLY what it says.</li>
            <li> I decided to be REALLY ambitious and try my bikini area...</li>
            <li> I am sure once I can actually see my feet...</li>
            <li> I am sure once I can actually see my feet...</li>
            <li> and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and</li>
            <li> and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and</li>
            <li> (Of course, there could be some operator error causing the &amp;#34;not pefectness.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I will try on my legs next to see if I have better results.</li>
            <li> My biggest concerns about waxing were about being able to rip the strips off properly, the bruising and the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This being my first time, I figured out not to do that again</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after the first time.</li>
            <li> I will say that I had to go over some areas multiple times to get all the hair, but I attribute this to my inexperience, and I found that areas of finer hair yielded more.</li>
            <li> and so I tried this at home first.</li>
            <li> did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to hold the skin as taut as possible.  </li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s got that holistic, natural thing going on if that&#x27;s important to you.  </li>
            <li> But I guess after the first time I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fill up the bottom of the tub (or sink) with hot water and place the strips in them immediately after use</li>
            <li> if only more strips came with it though.</li>
            <li> The only downside is you have to make sure you get the strip well attached first, because if not when you rip it off it doesn&#x27;t always work.    </li>
            <li> This is definitely easier than DIY sugar waxing but isn&#x27;t any better than a razor or epilator in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i also used this on my face and legs and never had any sort of pain, even the first time.     </li>
            <li> They still work 100% as well as the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> I then moved to more coarse hairs</li>
            <li> I like the cruelty-free ingredients -- in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they have a video, because I&#x27;m a total noob when it comes to removing hair except on my face and neck by razor.</li>
            <li> This wax really does wash off!</li>
            <li> It works (even the first time I tried it and didn&#x27;t know what I was doing).</li>
            <li> It even works on underarms pretty well.</li>
            <li> In short, I love this wax</li>
            <li> and tips to first time waxers:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was only able to use the product on one leg, both underarms, and the neck/chin area.  </li>
            <li> You will need more strips and Moom if you intend to do your entire body at once.  </li>
            <li> I believe Moom will work for some, but not all, so I wanted to give some tips to first time users so they would have the advantages that I did not.  </li>
            <li> If the Moom is too hot, it will burn you.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it dosent hurt or leave my skin all red.</li>
            <li> Removing the lid liner the first time was the trickiest part.</li>
            <li> Exactly as reviewers stated it will be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash first as instructed.</li>
            <li> And after a couple of sessions here and there, and much experience generally with sugar wax, I can say this is my favorite way to use this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all, and this Moom product is the first one that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash or whiteheads to form on my face.  </li>
            <li> Tried different strips, and found that the paper disposable ones work better than the cloth ones provided.  </li>
            <li> No weird smells.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by also saying that this was my first time ever waxing at home with a DIY kit.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be tempted to just use more on the popsicle stick so you can spread larger areas, but you cant do that because the jar is really tiny, and you&#x27;ll go through it REAL quick.</li>
            <li> will definitely be ordering a couple more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried to put it in hot water and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to be hot or runny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty convenient that you can just wash the wax off and reuse them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didnt spread smoothly when heated and didnt remove anywhere near all hair.  </li>
            <li> First, for everyone complaining about the amount of product, please note that they also sell this in a 12 oz.</li>
            <li> The pain was minimal, and everything washed up with warm water.</li>
            <li> The only wish I had for this product is that there were more application cloths included.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Moom kit</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the directions state to microwave it first</li>
            <li> (but it gets toooo hot for me)..</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a guy.  </li>
            <li> I have my back waxed by a professional, which makes me much more comfortable in a uniform shirt on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I had waxed my legs.  </li>
            <li> I just tried Moom for the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better way to deal with upper lip hair for a while.</li>
            <li> I opened the instructions and read them, and used the product exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> All in all, I really really couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I usually make my own sugar wax anymore because it&#x27;s basically free and works just as well.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Moom</li>
            <li> Two weeks after my first Moom-ing</li>
            <li> Well the first time I shaved was when I was twelve and then by fifteen</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want it to get hot like a wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to follow up this review, I already ordered a larger size of moom!</li>
            <li> I tried hot wax</li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of leg wax in my quest to never shave ever again -</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Gets oily if used in same spot more than twice&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been waxed before and this was a first time experience that I actually enjoyed, if that is possible with hair removal.</li>
            <li> applied the wax to the cloth first and then placed on skin taking note the direction of hair before putting the cloth on my skin.</li>
            <li> All reusable things too which is fabulous and not to mention no harsh</li>
            <li> tried it the first time today.  </li>
            <li> Smooth skin after all these years and using natural, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it since January and at first I used it once a week</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m pretty flexible).  </li>
            <li> I love this wax and would recommend it for facial use.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned, so I am always dealing with razor burn and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My first time ever sugaring...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have more control over smaller strips but the process will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;--Use</li>
            <li> Once I finish the tub, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase the Moom refills since the muslin strips and popsicle sticks are reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was my first time waxing my body.  </li>
            <li> It needs a higher temperature to reach a spreadable state.</li>
            <li> First time waxer, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> First attempt: Legs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit and since then have also ordered more removal strips and several of the the 12 oz size hair remover.  </li>
            <li> First, this is NOT wax.  </li>
            <li> Especially considering that the top layer of the skin has also been removed.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too hot for my underarms to bear.</li>
            <li> This was my first time self waxing</li>
            <li> And it never gets the hair the first time.</li>
            <li> If its your first time waxing or using this product, use numbing cream.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they let the product get too hot</li>
            <li> And, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you may have patchy legs the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> a first time waxer i had no idea.</li>
            <li> I didnt get the wax off the first time with the strip</li>
            <li> so I purchased this as my first self waxing kit</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time because (for some reason) ULTA that is in my area didn&#x27;t have an epilator.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly how the package told me to</li>
            <li> I definitely will recommend this to friends and will be buying more of the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; when I run out.</li>
            <li> somethings are better left</li>
            <li> This is the first waxing product I ever bough,vand also the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried waxing.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t need to be hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend heating it in a hot water.</li>
            <li> BUT this was my first time waxing my legs</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a extra strength wax, some hair can be more stubborn than others.</li>
            <li> First time waxing and</li>
            <li> but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me.</li>
            <li> In order to spread this sugar (thats all it is), it must be sufficiently hot, but of course that ends up burning your skin.</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s has better quality cotton strips and it is not necessary to heat in order to spread the product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nad&#x27;s since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> This took off all of the hair, first try.</li>
            <li> , I did once on my first batch</li>
            <li> I use a wooden cuticle pusher to apply the wax because this works better than the sticks provided with the Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use as much product to get the job done either!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with anything like waxing.</li>
            <li> I did not expect that much pain!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure it will last longer for others.</li>
            <li> I think I just liked the name and color, and I was just curious also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also pleased with Moom&#x27;s facial hair remover kit.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I did not follow the instructions and no hair was removed -</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at first, don&#x27;t try over and over again (like I did the first time with stubblies).</li>
            <li> I have tried it so many times, following instructions to the tee.</li>
            <li> Rub in the direction of the hair to make sure it covers it all, then pull in the opposite direction to take the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I microwaved it, and although it didn&#x27;t seem hot, it was</li>
            <li> I had to go back over some spots, which caused more pain.</li>
            <li> I am a first timer and</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to professionals or first time users.</li>
            <li> Just run it under hot water for a while.</li>
            <li> it first attaches to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (attempted to use) this product several times, each time hoping the amount of hair that would be removed would be greater.  </li>
            <li> i should have probably done a test area first.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> So the following week I decided to try it again now that I had a bit more experience under my belt.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> I first used Moom</li>
            <li> so it was more spreadable, but let it go back to room temperature.</li>
            <li> But after following the directions EXACTLY, I still could not get more than a couple of hairs removed.</li>
            <li> 20 seconds is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I really like the product ~!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a waxing product</li>
            <li> It did not remove most of the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly, and just got so so results.</li>
            <li> I applied it and as I was removing the first strip, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li> If you can leave the normal waxing rules behind and just follow the directions, you will be very happy!</li>
            <li> I wanted to remove facial hair mostly under my chin.</li>
            <li> and I think if you are lucky enough to have blond baby hair to get rid of, this would work fine.</li>
            <li> ITS MY FIRST TIME WAXING</li>
            <li> , I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li> Personally I feel like it&#x27;s a hassle to keep making sure</li>
            <li> First time waxer, I bought this for use on my lower legs and underarms before a vacation.</li>
            <li> I washed them exactly how the instructions say to</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than the Nads wax strips I had used before (it actually removes the hair).</li>
            <li> all good stuff,but messy.</li>
            <li> read a few good reviews and decided to try MOOM.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have a high pain tolerance from years of waxing and getting piercings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truly a brilliant product - it washes off the strips (reusable) and off your face so easily with cold water.</li>
            <li> and I am 7 months pregnant with my 4th, so not only could I not not get too comfortable lifting my leg to wax it</li>
            <li> It was very effective for me, comparable to the result I get from using hard wax.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about this product and will definitely be saving a lot of money now!</li>
            <li> among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more.</li>
            <li> among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more.</li>
            <li> Also, I love how naturally pleasing it smells and how it is completely natural and organic!</li>
            <li> Product was sticky and fairly messy, It didn&#x27;t apply smoothly because I don&#x27;t believe it was warm enough even though I followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, it make work for you or you may prefer shaving and waxing once you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I also liked the tissue and other stuffs coming with it.</li>
            <li> can be used several more times (if there wasn&#x27;t too much hair after the first rip)</li>
            <li> I read reviews about other people saying to warm it up</li>
            <li> I normally used the Very prewaxed strips, but in efforts to go more natural and use non toxic ingredients I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it was my first time really doing it successfully, I did it in small sections at a time</li>
            <li> My upper lip is a little bit tender, but I loved how easy it was to wash off the remaining product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to burn youself if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li> I did the sides fairly well and the top of the bikini area was the most difficult mainly due to my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> I also love the reusable cloth strips which rinse right off with hot water and dry relatively fast for reuse.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, it cleaned up easy, didn&#x27;t pull off any of my skin, and hurt surprisingly less than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very sticky and just use a warm wet wash cloth when using to wipe off skin or spills.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is pretty fine, and I get the impression that this stuff actually works better on coarse hair.    </li>
            <li> I used my tweezers to pluck a few hairs that I missed and my legs are smooth and hair free!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say you can make this stuff work if you REALLY want to, but you&#x27;re going to have to get a couple of jars or a larger jar of the stuff if you want to do more than one leg.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t really work for my armpits, but I think that was more my inexperience than it was anything to do with the product.</li>
            <li> This is far better than waxing-unless you go to a professional.</li>
            <li> Spreads smooth and the cloth strips stick better than the heavy paper ones.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m even near my time of the month which should make my bikini area all the more sensitive.</li>
            <li> however i had to apply the Moom several times on my upper lip for it to remove a good amount of hair  </li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s this difficult for SO many people to do it, then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and when I saw that this product only grabs the hairs, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am very fair skinned, I bruise very easily, and I have very thick dark hair.</li>
            <li> They recommended first doing it with a certain length</li>
            <li> : Left about 5% of the hairs- mostly just ones that were too short or fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d caution anyone who uses it that LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li> If I can use it anyone can, you may need to practice a bit, but it is worth it, great results and it only needs to be warmed a little so no worries about burns.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any positive experiences with homemade wax, so I will continue buying Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been buying cheaper products regularly (the Sally Hansen hair remover wax strip kit or microwavable facial wax), but I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to spend more and try something new.  </li>
            <li> The wax is water soluble so a little bit of water is all you need to clean up excess wax on your body, any wax that dripped on the counter top or floor ,etc...  4)</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really have the hang of pulling the strips and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have waxed pretty much my whole body (arms, legs, underarms, eyebrows)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, takes the hair away for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every DIY wax out there...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s economical, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s empowering, and it&#x27;s even quite a bit of fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fast with my waxing</li>
            <li> Havent tried a whole lot of waxing products but this stuff seems pretty legit.</li>
            <li> I bought it for bikini waxing but found out you can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous when I took the first pull</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing to pull out those hairs, after being applied exactly as per directions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely painless, but a million times better than the wax strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my legs and underarms, just be sure your hair isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> first time I tried it I overzealously microwaved the wax too much</li>
            <li> If you wanted to cut your own strips out of a soft, cotton muslin, which I don&#x27;t, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still a good product, but unless they change the type of fabric strips they send with the product, I can no longer recommend it - which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair, probably medium course-ness and while Moom does pull some of the hair out, it&#x27;s just not as effective as wax and it takes a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> but I think I read the more you do it, the less quickly regrowth will occur.</li>
            <li> I was super pleased that I was hair less.</li>
            <li> As a man, I&#x27;ve been shaving the twig and berries for years, twice a week, to keep everything neat and tidy down there.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and very sensitive to A LOT of ingredients in typical OTC products.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly in the microwave and stays at a nice consistency long enough for you to finish waxing.</li>
            <li> smaller sticks made it very easy to create a fairly precise line in the arch of my brows without worrying about accidents, something that is fairly easy to screw up and in my opinion is what brow pencils were made to hide (at least when I do them).</li>
            <li> the instructions were simple, the wax was easy to apply without being too hot, and cleanup was a snap - just a little warm water.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use that I will definitely do this over shaving or anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> They have some very helpful educational information and a video tutorial which I found very helpful.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I&#x27;m on blood thinners, so I bruise easy.</li>
            <li> This was easily solved by having a damp wash cloth next to me.</li>
            <li> If you miss some hairs, it&#x27;s easy to go over the same spot again without making it sore.</li>
            <li> If the included fabric strips wear out, I can go to the fabric store, buy a yard of muslin fabric for less than $2, and make my own with a pair of scissors, I figure.    </li>
            <li> and I used wax on my left to easily compare the two.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is lotion-free and completely dry before beginning&lt;</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, and being that its all-natural, clean-up is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Great for small sensitive areas like bikini.</li>
            <li> , I love that the strips are reusable - you just need to soak them in water and then leave them out to dry.</li>
            <li> Just be sure that your skin is dry or the wax will not adhere to your hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use, all you need is place  the jar into the oven for 10 second, then apply on your skin and wax!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my legs super duper soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tweezers before, but I really couldn&#x27;t do much &#x27;cause it&#x27;d sting so much my eyes would water, but this stuff was not the case!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it unheated, slightly heated, and warm.  </li>
            <li> but the process is simple and easy to do.</li>
            <li> favorite part of these is that you just need to wash the strips in water and you can reuse them again once they&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and will definitely be buying a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> but I was not sure about the face as my eyes were watering too much for a good look.  </li>
            <li> I had to slowly peel the wax off one hair at a time it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I was also using the large strips.</li>
            <li> Regardless, you are pulling large quantities of hair out by the root which is attached to blood vessels and pain receptor cells</li>
            <li> My issue is with the large fabric strips in the kit I received from Vitacost.  </li>
            <li> I then placed the jar in a large mug of boiling water</li>
            <li> The application sticks did not help, as they take large bits, and clumps to whichever hair</li>
            <li> I expect I will be using less next time, as I found that I didn&#x27;t need to spread more product on each time, but just put the strip with some wax already on it onto the next section, rub it to warm the product, wait a moment for it to cool, and then rip again and repeat until it wasn&#x27;t sticky enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is nice in that you don&#x27;t HAVE to heat it up, but there have been times during colder months that I find it&#x27;s more solid than usual.</li>
            <li> Then I read about this product, and when I saw only 4 completely natural organic ingredients on it, it was love at first sight.</li>
            <li> Even though I only got to use half of the container, I still felt that I got great value for my money and have reordered.</li>
            <li> If you let the wax warm up too much, it&#x27;ll pull less hair out.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done waxing I screw the lid on nice and tight and rinse any wax on the bottle off.  </li>
            <li> Washes off quickly, with no mess at all.</li>
            <li> It appeared to work much better on the course, longer hair and less effective on the finer, shorter hairs as expected.  </li>
            <li> At first I did not see any improvement as I have to tweeze significantly after that initial use.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the end results but they were such a mess</li>
            <li> I do dread the idea of spending the time doing large areas like my whole leg.</li>
            <li> I love that it is sensitive enough for my face, but it&#x27;s strong enough to use on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Leaving it on the warmer keeps it at just the right consistency) and cut the longer strips in half so that I have more pieces to use in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your room temperature is a little on the warm side, you won&#x27;t have to heat this up.</li>
            <li> When I searched prices for waxing in saloons they all ranged pretty high.</li>
            <li> All great results - again, not perfect, but pretty close!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very easy, much easier than ripping your pubes out with your bare hands like I have been doing for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li> for removing any extra product from the skin, I found out that using Witch Hazel works really well for cleaning off residue off the skin leaving a smooth, unsticky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> It was not great for really course hair like on the underarms but worked great on legs and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I then used masking tape to tape my shoulder and forarms back to make the skin taunt, then I warmed it like suggested to a honey consistency and applied it real light, then I pulled it in the opposite direction of my skin growth.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different times, but I still wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Really like that fabric strips are reusable.</li>
            <li> And the redness went away amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li> Also my hair is very course</li>
            <li> With much saddness I must say that this product did not work.</li>
            <li> What really attracted me to this product were the reviews, and now I can confirm that if you are used to going to a salon</li>
            <li> , I really can&#x27;t think of anything else.    </li>
            <li> I would have worn myself out too much to finish.</li>
            <li> Overall I think its a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Once I started using it, I was very displeased.</li>
            <li> It works really well also.</li>
            <li> It works really well for removing hair also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gosh darned frustrating when I order a product with great reviews....</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> The only additional purchase I made was a pack of toothpicks, which I use to smooth the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a real plus-</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than going somewhere to get waxed.</li>
            <li> and I may very well be a convert</li>
            <li> All you really need to buy is some strips, tongue depressors and a jar.</li>
            <li> It went much smoother when I started doing this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with</li>
            <li> I used it once on each under arm but discarded too much work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to really work well at all.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t brake out as much.</li>
            <li> By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom.  </li>
            <li> By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom.  </li>
            <li> I also found out that you really have to apply it paper-thin, because if it&#x27;s anything thicker, it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair.</li>
            <li> The Moom really stuck to it</li>
            <li> Doesnt work really well but helps with hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It works really well on the hairs of my arm pits and face.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; was very sticky but it did work at removing the hair from my arms.</li>
            <li> But I was fed up of spending so much money on getting waxed</li>
            <li> this product removes hair without pain and is gentle.</li>
            <li> However, epilating my thighs hurt so much, I decided to wax them, and just keep epilating my lower legs.    </li>
            <li> I also have my doubts that this stuff is really pulling it out at the root.    </li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions and it just didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel like wasting that much money again</li>
            <li> I followed directions very closely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving the same star rating because the wait for smooth skin with this product is a bit</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> VERY sticky&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some websites I had visited stated that this was the correct way to do sugaring, and MOOM is really just a form of sugaring.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t make a mistake with this product.  </li>
            <li> yes it really, really works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, so get ready to wash your hands a lot.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions say to be careful not overheat - this is important!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have that much body hair to remove and</li>
            <li> It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else.</li>
            <li> If you read the instructions carefully, and follow what they say, this product removes hair the fastest and most</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can get a tad sticky, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with it getting everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Nad&#x27;s for my feet, and never had any real issue with it, but I was just looking to try something</li>
            <li> It is gentle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for having to let my hair grow out so long,but I figured you had to do that with any wax.  </li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t work, unless you want to become a Gulag torture</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet was really helpful as well.</li>
            <li> Left me smooth with zero irritation.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those disposable strips.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest Moom if you&#x27;re looking for an at-home wax!</li>
            <li> The hydrophobic qualities of this product WILL NOT ADHERE PROPERLY IF NOT APPLIED TO A CLEAN, DRY, OIL AND MAKEUP FREE AREA!</li>
            <li> I dabbed until the sugar wax seeped through the cloth (really grab to the hair)</li>
            <li> the process is a whole lot easier than I was anticipating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I just use extra light olive oil for face and body.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get too sticky or cold, but the liquid-y texture makes the best results I think.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure the area is clean and dry and only put a paper-thin amount on the area.  </li>
            <li> This sugaring still hurt, but didn&#x27;t seem to hurt quite as much.</li>
            <li> that was very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I admit I have very well-muscled calves, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it just sounded like too much work.  </li>
            <li> beginners may find it difficult to spread the sugar (unless experienced and expert at waxing) initially, but I think with practice it will get better</li>
            <li> I just used this and already the redness (pinkness) is fading, and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.</li>
            <li> if this stuff is made from sugar and lemon juice, how much could i screw up if I did it myself.  </li>
            <li> Have your area ready - lay out some paper towels or anything to catch sticky drips</li>
            <li> If the jar can be used to the very end, I won&#x27;t have to go to the spa for waxing for about 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> You will probably need a warmer because it solidifies so fast.</li>
            <li> Using an epilator took too much time.</li>
            <li> Th hair does grow back in light.</li>
            <li> but I had to go over several spots twice to get all of it for a really smooth look.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilation and it is much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> , i really like how its water-soluble.  </li>
            <li> all hairs were removed in one go with skin left smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After READING THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY THOROUGHLY, I began.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like this product and the results I got from it.</li>
            <li> The cloth strips are reusable, so you&#x27;re really getting your value out of this product.</li>
            <li> I always get bumps and fast regrowth after shaving</li>
            <li> Unfortunate, because this seemed like such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love my Parissa strips [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it takes too much time to wax compared to shaving either.</li>
            <li> GOT REALLY</li>
            <li> Stick to real wax and skip the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; marketing hype.</li>
            <li> and I take ao much time to do so.</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky, but even when I use the Very strips I always get some wax on my hands anyway.</li>
            <li> The strips are said to be reusable but mine didn&#x27;t do very well in the wash</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think that they really would.</li>
            <li> Works much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it really only kept me smooth for about 4 days.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really like the strips it comes with.</li>
            <li> But my hair grows extremly fast.</li>
            <li> For having not waxed in over 5 years, it didn&#x27;t even hurt that much</li>
            <li> Very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole container in my &amp;#34;girlstache&amp;#34; and part of my legs (up to the knees).</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really pull all of the hair out.</li>
            <li> but without the negatives- it really does wash off with water, and</li>
            <li> (You can add a couple drops of tea tree oil and chamomile but don&#x27;t really notice a difference.)</li>
            <li> This stuff cools fast</li>
            <li> I was spending $25-30 every month for a very conservative bikini wax.</li>
            <li> It works very well if directions are followed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even sting as much as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that one part of my leg is really itchy and it hurts whenever I get goosebumps.</li>
            <li> It was really dissapointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comparable to waxing.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I really like it-</li>
            <li> No section came out completely smooth, and it took almost the entire jar to do the lower part of my legs.</li>
            <li> I also tried this on my face and it didn&#x27;t give me rashes like the others and didn&#x27;t pain much.</li>
            <li> and yet I couldn&#x27;t keep the product warm enough to spread easily enough.</li>
            <li> Of course you don&#x27;t care what it tastes like, but when you&#x27;re spreading a product directly under your nose, it is important that it is made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural wax, and threw out my Veet wax strips because of the BHA and red dye content.</li>
            <li> (You don&#x27;t want the stuff to be too warm though, it needs to be solid and sticky enough to pull the hairs out.)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used multiple products and i love that the strips are reusable and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> Another thing that I use is my old Nads applicator stick, it is angled and works better than the wooden stick for the bikini line.</li>
            <li> I finally tried the microwave and found one minute to be too hot and 20 seconds too cool for me.  </li>
            <li> Never having used such a product before I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and love  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth from no hair; no little bumps all over the chin area like shaving leaves; I suppose because the hair is still so close to the surface; my skin also feels moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> You have to apply a VERY thin layer of wax, or else it won&#x27;t be very effective, and you&#x27;ll quickly run out of wax.</li>
            <li> If you do it carefully, warming the wax to the right consistency, working in approximately 1x1 squares and pulling with confidence, it&#x27;s totally great!    </li>
            <li> Moom removed the long hairs on my legs perfectly but left the ones that were a millimeter or less.</li>
            <li> * if you&#x27;re using this product on your bikini area and you&#x27;ve never waxed before, expect some mild to moderate pain the first time.</li>
            <li> The area has not grown back as quickly as the first two times.</li>
            <li> But as a waxing product goes its been pretty gentle and makes my skin very soft after waxing.</li>
            <li> Especially that there are some good reviews to this product which makes me think that if it works for some other people it still may work for me.</li>
            <li> This wax is really easy to use, especially for quick facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> Also the ingredients in this wax are much more gentle on my face than other waxes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy on and easy off causing me hardly any pain.  </li>
            <li> I used most of this pretty fast, there isn&#x27;t enough to do your entire legs, but maybe one.</li>
            <li> The wax itself spreads much more easily than other brands and does not need to be heated as long.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful being able to do a quick hair removal as soon as I notice some extra hairs instead of waiting until the problem is bad enough to justify a trip to the salon.    </li>
            <li> you want natural results that keep your skin clean and exfoliated at thesame time while waxing, then go all natural and go with Moom.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little different than other self waxing kits and i found it worked best when you follow it exactly.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s sure a lot cheaper than paying someone to do the job for me every other week.</li>
            <li> Also, I really like that the sugar washes off with water instead of needing an oil to remove it, because I don&#x27;t normally buy baby oil,  or have a bottle of that blue stuff that comes with wax available.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my lip, a little tricky on the eyebrows but probably cause the hairs aren&#x27;t as long</li>
            <li> no more spending $100 a month or more on waxing!</li>
            <li> The normal bumps and leg redness went away fast overnight and left me with smooth skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better than the other wax i was using before.</li>
            <li> ;D Everything I Moomed, afterwards was baby soft!</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman who has only heard about waxing...and the first to admit there is a huge learning curve involved with usage of this product.  </li>
            <li> We tried it about a dozen times to make sure is wasn&#x27;t due to user error.</li>
            <li> - Very very sticky which has the potential to be messy, and not exactly the greatest on courser hair</li>
            <li> I will have to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back, but right now I think this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a product that is simple to use and that does exactly what it says then this is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> You would then need to clean up the strips so that you could have enough strips to do another body part.  </li>
            <li> that was my first reaction, until I made myself try it a few more times.</li>
            <li> If you have Asian or fine hair, you will most likely have the same results that I did.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very simple to clean</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first couple of times it worked great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and clean, just follow directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s quite as powerful as normal wax, and how the time/moom cost compares to the cost of a professional wax job.</li>
            <li> - I think we all have realistic expectations here), but the difference with sugar solutions like this is that after you pull the first strip and most of the hair is removed, the second strip only grabs the remaining hair, not the skin.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it as I would much rather prefer to use a product with less chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a sting, but it doesn&#x27;t linger like the hard wax does and the skin is smooth right away, with the redness disappearing quickly.    </li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and not at all messy.  </li>
            <li> In more sensitive areas (testicles, for instance), you&#x27;ll want to spread the testicle skin as far to one side as you can and rip the other direction quickly.</li>
            <li> With that said, I&#x27;m most familiar with waxing, having done so for the past 15 years, both professionally and at home.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can reuse the wooden applicators and then just run them under hot water and the remaining wax comes right off.</li>
            <li> With the Moom, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly at all, and the Moom is much gentler on my face.</li>
            <li> and I quickly got the hang of it so that the second leg was much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely water soluble, is easy to use and is entirely organic</li>
            <li> The strips clean easily with water and wash ASAP after use and let dry flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past five years, and I refuse to try anything else because of how amazing it</li>
            <li> then most people might, even still, if I used this same amount again, it looks like I would have at least four more leg waxings.</li>
            <li> legs feel silky soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> that said, I&#x27;m using it on a pretty sensitive area.</li>
            <li> In the starter kit there is not enough Moom or strips to do a really good job on your entire body, especially if you decide that you want to do both legs.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for 15 minutes and the honey was so hot that I nearly burned</li>
            <li> I usually get my brows done at my sisters salon, but I decided to buy my own</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever waxed my armpits so they&#x27;re sensitive</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the one and two star reviews that are actually helpful and TRUE.</li>
            <li> Of course test this on your skin first - if you&#x27;re sensitive to heat</li>
            <li> This is the first time I wax and saw that this product was all natural, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is pretty sensitive too</li>
            <li> The product works as well as you can expect it to if you&#x27;re doing it at home for the first time you&#x27;re not going to get professional results</li>
            <li> Not bad but still didn&#x27;t get all the hair and left wax on my skin that was NOT coming off.  </li>
            <li> It warmed up and spread fine, however it didn&#x27;t pull a single hair from my leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have fairly fine, soft hair.</li>
            <li> Place a fabric strip over the area and rub up and down with your palm a couple times to make sure all the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is in contact with the strip.</li>
            <li> Be sure to brush on the wax with the hair growth direction and peel back against hair growth - it&#x27;s not a straight up pull where you&#x27;re ripping your skin upward, it&#x27;s more of a fast peel action in the opposite direction of the hair</li>
            <li> After i used it, my skin turned normal (from being bright red) in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so.</li>
            <li> rinse the fabric strips with warm water when I&#x27;m done and press them flat to dry.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff doesn&#x27;t really burn or sting when you rip it off; it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> Works great but so sticky that it&#x27;s hard to open the Harv</li>
            <li> would, you just want it to be warm and lessen the original thick consistency enough so that application is smoother.</li>
            <li> So, I learned how to make it thanks to youtube and haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since.</li>
            <li> Have used wax, sugar based products, the whole spectrum, this really doesn&#x27;t attach well at all, and you have to do each area 2-3 times before you get the desired results, which means more time, and slightly raw skin.  </li>
            <li> More control, and less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, absolutely no pain, job is done in minutes and wash away the wax with water.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to remove with warm water if you spill the wax or decide that it is too painful, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> and I was never super satisfied with the look afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would say I have enough product left over for three more applications on my lower legs.  </li>
            <li> sure you pull the cloth as parallel to your skin as possible.</li>
            <li> I purchased the classic kit (with tea tree oil).    </li>
            <li> I was ripped off but at least I now know of a way to wax effectively without going to a pricey salon in this economic climate.</li>
            <li> (unless you have the larger jar, but that will probably go quick as well.)    </li>
            <li> It did not take all the hairs in area applied and took several times to get it completely hair free.</li>
            <li> While I really like this--doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing, all natural, reusable cloth strips--there are some cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very specific to the direction of your growth, if that makes any sense, more so than regular wax.</li>
            <li> Main reason being for comfort, not looks.  </li>
            <li> It has to be hot to spread, problem is it burns if you have it hot enough to spread.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent stuff.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I got this stuff mainly for my brows, so</li>
            <li> It definitely worked by those directions, actually a lot better than the product I&#x27;d used before this.</li>
            <li> Getting older, means getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pull strip in the opposite direction as the wax was applied at a 45 degree angle quickly.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up burning and blistering my skin the first time I used this product because the wax was so hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used standard wax and then Moom, and the Moom is much better than just regular wax.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m practically stubble free and not one single bump.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m a man that wanted to clean up his chest and other areas and not have to do it all the time.</li>
            <li> but really, you need it to be pretty liquidesque to get a nice thin layer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get every single little microscopic hair on the first try, but I think it will just take a little practice to get perfect results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching it before you start.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li> and I have a high pain threshold.</li>
            <li> On some, I folded them, but that wasn&#x27;t highly successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> but despite all of the high praises for Moom, I think it is a bit overrated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li> methods\\&quot;, you should not be lead to believe that this is a painless operation, and I have high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as it has NO chemicals to deal with.</li>
            <li> Before using this, I highly recommend watching the how-to video offered by Moom&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> First time waxing at home, I bought this as my skin is very sensitive and it had the tea tree oil and was completely organic.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for a home waxing kit.</li>
            <li> High quality fabric strips.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people who are looking for a waxing product.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes from this product after looking at the reviews.</li>
            <li> so I highly doubt its my technique, the was just won&#x27;t grab onto those hairs.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They usually never included enough wax strips to do 2 full legs.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this product, even first time waxers!</li>
            <li> Even though this was my first time and thus I would expect it to take longer to do the whole thing, it probably took less than an hour, but in my case, the need to move back and forth to get things (re-heat the product, get a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time.</li>
            <li> I found it worked a little bit better if I waited for about a minute before removing the strip.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> (a little more than a stubble)</li>
            <li> , I feel that it is not strong enough for the bikini area which although sensitive I think benefits from a very strong but quick wax.</li>
            <li> You may want to look into a candle warmer or something to keep the wax warm, because it becomes hard to spread when it cools off.</li>
            <li> removed facial hair with less pain than waxing and threading; product residue easily washes off face and hair removal strips with just water;strips are reusable after drying; no terrible odor; no need to heat up; convenient small container so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a huge pot of sugar    </li>
            <li> I swabbed the area with a little alcohol first, and when this dried, applied a light dusting of powder so the MOOM would stick better.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put more wax on it and try to pull it out again - move on to other areas, then wash and dry the areas that need to be gone over again and start fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a natural product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is natural and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, reasonably priced and</li>
            <li> It was quite messy as well but easy to clean up then regular wax.</li>
            <li> but it felt no worse then having this done at a professional spa, which I have done.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and am pleasantly surprised that it worked really well on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Always use on CLEAN, DRY skin, and also use baby powder beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Much faster to just shave, or get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> You really do need to remove any natural oils</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product at all, I will admit it was the first time I have use this kind of method.</li>
            <li> I did not experience the redness/bruises that I do with normal wax.  </li>
            <li> hot enough (obviously don&#x27;t burn yourself, but I get it pretty hot).</li>
            <li> THIs product was a total success for  me!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it pays for itself if you normally pay to get waxed.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy but gets better each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> make sure hair is not too long and not too short</li>
            <li> Second attempt: 2 weeks worth of leg hair</li>
            <li> I will update this review after I try waxing an area that I normally shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was 3/8&amp;#34; or so long, applied the sugar to the strips (at room temp) and pressed it into the hair, starting at the top of my man area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably different for every person, and I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I heated it for 10 seconds in the microwave, still seemed pretty thick, so I gave it 5 more seconds.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure waxing would&#x27;ve killed me maybe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I will need to follow up the moom with either plucking/epilating or shaving these leftover hairs or try moom again in a few more days.</li>
            <li> and I rarely ever need to use the latter.</li>
            <li> This product did smell good and was not at all irritating to my skin, but it does nothing for its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> Give it a good stir and apply a thin layer to the area to be waxed.</li>
            <li> but it was really hard to get at the right temp and keep it warm so you can actually do a leg.</li>
            <li> Sure, there is some pain involved, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, and, when you wax on a regular basis, the pain lessens since the hair root weakens and the hairs pull out more easily.  </li>
            <li> The idea of this stuff is great (organic, easy to clean up, less painful), but the stuff itself is ehh.    </li>
            <li> Long story short, I am very familiar with waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to use</li>
            <li> While the shingles lesions quickly went away, I was left with pretty severe post herpetic neuralgia (aka: pain) on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li> It cools off pretty quickly and needs to be reheated several times when doing a big area like legs-</li>
            <li> That was a slightly more difficult task I will say and the hair did not come off as easily</li>
            <li> Whereas, on washed, cleaned hair, such as my pubs and bikini area, the wax didn&#x27;t grab hold of the hair too well and caused more pain than the dry, uncleaned hair of the arm pits.</li>
            <li> I liked Moom&#x27;s idea of using a couple of extra tools ( spreading stick and cloths) to get the job done with less agony.</li>
            <li> I do get some red bumps in several spots on my face; but they go away very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had been going for professional waxing or using other famous brands for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but they give you more than enough for a single use.  </li>
            <li> 3rd time is a charm, right?</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right, but I tried every way possible.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of Moom though after doing my right leg (and there was still hair left).  </li>
            <li> Only positive is it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be super long before MOOM will work.  </li>
            <li> I would use this in my cool, dry room, use the witch hazel to wipe off any excess and then take a bath to wash off all of the residue</li>
            <li> It just needs a few seconds in the microwave and it stays warm enough to use for more than long enough to wax your face.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it works better when the wax is warmer and can spread thinner without pulling on loose hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I would be pleased with the results from the first use; before I began the waxing process, I assured myself that I would need to be patient and give it a few tries just in case it didn&#x27;t work out at first.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat fine and actually would take about 3 weeks before it started to grow back after a visit to the salon.    </li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll almost certainly have to go over the same area again to get all of the hair (which is why it takes so much).</li>
            <li> so I would either have to shave to get smooth skin now or wait for the other hair to grow out and try again...</li>
            <li> so you can stick it back on when you are dipping your little pot of miracle into warm water.</li>
            <li> The wax gets extremely hot very fast, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to sugaring and waxing altogether, so this was an experiment.</li>
            <li> Unlike waxing, which also grabs live cells, Moom doesn&#x27;t tear your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I had to order a new package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 strips about a dozen times and they are still like new.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any new ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing that area</li>
            <li> She has used an Epilator for years now but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and fairly new to hair removal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing.</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical city (Miami, Florida)</li>
            <li> I am a new user to waxes and sugar waxes</li>
            <li> day, while inspecting my new growth I decided to give it another try and to my surprise it worked,</li>
            <li> Maybe because I am fairly new at all of this</li>
            <li> You definitely do have to go over most areas more than once, especially if your hairs grow in pretty random directions and not in much of a \\&quot;pattern\\&quot; like mine.  </li>
            <li> , this is a nicer product that hurts less, smell delicious and causes way less damage than the other waxes.</li>
            <li> a professional might be the better choice for the initial go due to how much hair men have.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked amazing for my eyebrows but had a harder time clinging to the small fine hairs on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> -It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, so you can wax your skin multiple times without much irritation.</li>
            <li> It effectively removes all but a few stubborn hairs and my skin doesn&#x27;t turn red at all.</li>
            <li> PROFESSIONAL WAXER DOES A MUCH MORE THOROUGH JOB AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLY MESSY AND INCONSISTENT EFFECTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When at last I could hold the jar comfortably in my hand, I gathered the included wooden spatula and dipped into the goo -  ladies, it is like trying to dip honey with a stick.  </li>
            <li> (Comes with very clear instructions, too, for beginners.)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and found there is no irritation or redness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use it my skin gets very sensitive for a couple of days, almost untouchable, add to that the fact I get ingrown hair</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Note that I use this on some very sensitive areas,</li>
            <li> , I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at both</li>
            <li> I do have a high pain tolerance, but all women know the bikini area is always incredibly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily be cleaned after you are done and doesn&#x27;t leave any mess, just damp towel with water.</li>
            <li> Be sure that hair has somewhere to grow out of!&lt;br /&gt;- a few drinks can really help in the pain area (but not so much in the making a mess area) ;)if you&#x27;re doing it yourself and you&#x27;ve never done it before.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Be sure that hair has somewhere to grow out of!&lt;br /&gt;- a few drinks can really help in the pain area (but not so much in the making a mess area) ;)</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area because otherwise you just waste it and it is more clean up and could be irratating.</li>
            <li> Even if you are messy, the clean up is easy with just a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> If the bottle sticks shut for the next use, run it under hot water and it softens the sugar.</li>
            <li> I expect there won&#x27;t be bleeding next time around if the trend is consistent.     </li>
            <li> Trust me, if you&#x27;re waxing for the first time, especially in the bikini area, choose Moom!!</li>
            <li> I used one of the larger wooden sticks to spread the first layer, and the first mistake was made.</li>
            <li> I tried my Moom for the first time yesterday on my upper lip and eyebrow area.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even though it removed some hairs it left A LOT</li>
            <li> Thirdly, this was my first ever waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it works better than any other hair remover I&#x27;ve ever used (Nads, Veet, Nair, Tweezers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review about anything before, but I got Moom in the mail today and WOW!</li>
            <li> Lastly, I ended up burning myself (ugly scars on my upper-lip that healed after a week) 2-3 times because the wax gets very hot under the top layer, but the top layer doesn&#x27;t appear affected by the heat</li>
            <li> Anyone who is having trouble either is probably using too much wax (then you only pull off the excess wax) or has more resistant hair than I do.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s usually smaller, finer hairs remaining after a first wax.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I microwaved the glass jar (lid off) for 10 seconds, which was enough, since it&#x27;s hot today.</li>
            <li> After 40 seconds, it was suddenly too hot.</li>
            <li> I tried sally hansen brazilian wax to begin with my first time waxing my bikini BIG mistake.</li>
            <li> I DID end up breaking out in whiteheads on my face, just as I had with regular hot wax.  </li>
            <li> My first time waxing was the hardest though since I had a low tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> On the small amount of wax that I was able to apply, it did remove some hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ll try again, maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it well enough when I first used it.</li>
            <li> tips:&lt;br /&gt;--You want to make sure you are putting a small amount and spreading it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;--If</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually works really well, too!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve tried my very best.&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> All the hairs doesnt come up in one take, i need to try 2-3 times to come up completely!</li>
            <li> just enough so that it is easier to spread on your skin, but not too hot or else</li>
            <li> It helped but wasn&#x27;t  hot enough.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Every time I pulled off a strip, I had to stop and say WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow, I feel like a woman again!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It will give you the EXACT same results!</li>
            <li> For those of you girls out there that have a great, thick head of hair but have problems with other areas of your body, I&#x27;m one of you, buddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> The second learning cure involves when to scream - first time there was a bit of a shock, a delay</li>
            <li> I mentioned this to my friend, she told me that she had the exact same experience</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li> Ladies, do not expect assistance from your &amp;#34;better half&amp;#34; - mine grew wide eyed and ran out of the house when I sweetly asked for some help here.  </li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I wasn&#x27;t nervous, especially because I knew this comes right off with water (quite easily, actually--just wet a washcloth and rub it over the sticky area</li>
            <li> I decided to go back the next day and clean up the area</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to put on, and requires less frequent reapplication than shaving.</li>
            <li> very fine hair, but I never liked it.</li>
            <li> I only had to heat it in my microwave the initial time for 10 seconds, and it stayed warm enough to use for the entire 30 minutes I needed to do my waxing.  </li>
            <li> I did the bikini area, which I assume is one of the most sensitive body parts, and yet I had very little pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quickly and easily removed the trouble hair I no longer wanted.  </li>
            <li> I should note that if I accidentally pluck a hair that is too far into my eyebrows I bleed as well, and hot wax made my eyebrows red and swollen for a week.     </li>
            <li> After the first strip on a particular area, the second one barely stingsat all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more manageable to spread thin layer of wax on the cloth than it is on your body, especially for smaller, more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the same as the hot wax and strips that Everyone offers.</li>
            <li> and it was my first time working with such tools I completely tore that stuff up.</li>
            <li> mom had sworn by Nads in the past, so I was gonna go for that, but this stuff was cheaper and looked to be not only cost effective, but</li>
            <li> You have to heat it for about 15 seconds before it can be soft enough to use, at which point the mixture is too hot to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mainly on my legs and worked very well and didn&#x27;t need to wax for almost 2 whole months until the hairs started to grow back, but in much smaller amounts.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in this option in case it didn&#x27;t work out, but I plan on getting a warmer for next time, and there will definitely be a next time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair on my underarms is a bit more coarse and it was long enough</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t hurt so much as the other ones, including the wax that I used to get done in the parlor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad, the prodcut smells super good, my super-ultra-sensitive-allergic-to-everything skin doesn&#x27;t have any side effects with Moom.</li>
            <li> Moom allows me to spend more time actually removing hair, and less time preparing.</li>
            <li> I used the entire 6oz jar on just the bottom half of each leg, and they are STILL more than 60% covered in hair.</li>
            <li> No matter if I tried it on the more course hair on my legs or the less course stubs of my eyebrows to even the finest hair above my lip or under my chin..</li>
            <li> and I only reacted mildly for a short time.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the hair grew back quickly</li>
            <li> The stomach hair was easiest to remove; the other areas required multiple times to wax off (mainly due to a few hairs that were being stubborn), for those its best to just pluck off.     </li>
            <li> few months ago, I read an Amazon review from someone who used MOOM cold -- i.e. room temperature, she didn&#x27;t heat it up first -- and liked it better that way.</li>
            <li> So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn&#x27;t really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are a female and you don&#x27;t want to use this on a large area it would probably work, but</li>
            <li> ; 2) don&#x27;t press down on the strips, just rub three times quickly; 3) don&#x27;t overheat the wax... and the wax melts from the center so even though the bottle feels cool</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, doesn&#x27;t hurt too much, don&#x27;t have to warm it up when using it for facial hair, and it is easy to wash the cloths.</li>
            <li> Apply it very, very thin in the direction of the hair growth, lightly rub down on the muslin strips then give it a good, continuous yank.  </li>
            <li> That way I can use a more generous amount without trying to be so sparing with this tiny little jar.    </li>
            <li> I had waxed most of my bikini area except left a little strip on each side of the lips.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After more searching, I ordered hard wax without strips ([...]</li>
            <li> I guess I had very high expectations, reading the prior customer&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> a thick coat will just leave you with a gooey mess  * after putting the strip on the waxed area, make sure you rub it (not hard but quickly)</li>
            <li> I was shaving as often as I knew I was going to wear shorts or short sleeved shirts, and you guys shaving got old fast.</li>
            <li> The directions are clearly written.</li>
            <li> This one is less sticky and easier to clean up after.</li>
            <li> I did an immediate clean up of the counter, the sink and the floor and left the strips to dry.  </li>
            <li> I clearly need to let the professionals do the work and keep my daytime job.</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as wax but much less pain and easier to clean after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it done professionally (</li>
            <li> Not messy.  </li>
            <li> and they are ready to reuse for the next use.</li>
            <li> Maybe the wax was old or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend a considerable amount of time doing this, but I guess I&#x27;ll get faster if I keep it up...</li>
            <li> Having never used a wax or sugaring product before, it took me the whole package of cloth strips to do my upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that waxing will never be completely painless.</li>
            <li> , the redness faded and it was soft.</li>
            <li> a professional.</li>
            <li> , the redness faded and it was soft.</li>
            <li> a professional.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural, no wax hair removal product.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I surprised.</li>
            <li> Compared to waxing, sugar is nearly painless.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like I was ripping off an old bandage, I just feel the sticky sugar lifting off of my skin.     </li>
            <li> All in all, I found the results were to my liking, and I thought the price was reasonable since you can get a lot of hair from just a tiny application of the paste.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or your time on this product.  </li>
            <li> I waxed my legs completely and wanted to keep going.  </li>
            <li> this product works really well if you use it properly.</li>
            <li> * wash the area before waxing (any lotions, natural oils, etc will interfere with the ability of the product to stick to the hair)  </li>
            <li> use this primarily to remove facial hair (upper lip and chin), and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove my hair, and doesn&#x27;t go far at all.</li>
            <li> My husband loves my soft skin opposed to stubles from shaving.</li>
            <li> my guess is that I was sold an old wax or something...</li>
            <li> Do not warm the Moom more than advised.  </li>
            <li> Apply the strip, ensuring that you move your hand across the strip so that it is adhered and pull the strip with a fast motion in the opposite direction.  </li>
            <li> Before trying Moom, I was using Nads, another natural product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Moom hair removal kit.  </li>
            <li> I think that is why people are experiencing hair breakage rather than hair being completely pulled off by the roots.</li>
            <li> : Btw I only use this for my bikini area (the whole area) and sometimes under arms, for everything else I use an epilator machine.</li>
            <li> I used harsher waxes for 15 years, and developed melasma from the skin layers they took off over time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to a professional because of the horror stories I had heard, so I wanted to try sugaring since I heard you can do it all by yourself.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much smoother, and hair took longer to grow back than with shaving.</li>
            <li> , I find that it doesn&#x27;t catch as much hair, maybe the hair is too short?</li>
            <li> tried this again... removed the longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in.</li>
            <li> I have used about 3.longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in.</li>
            <li> lower neck hair look no further, this stuff really works and beats paying $450 at a hair removal place.</li>
            <li> will admit that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sensitive to use products like Nair.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed before - the whole idea sounded too intimidating, especially after hearing tales of ingrown hairs and damage to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten it professionally done</li>
            <li> -removes coarse leg hair  -gentle on the skin  </li>
            <li> I can now wax all my areas, and not have to do it all the time and wear a bathing suit without feeling self conscious.</li>
            <li> When I used them, I had considerable bruising which I&#x27;ve never had with the lightweight strips.</li>
            <li> I spoke with the Moom company directly</li>
            <li> I have to admit it actually works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have two young kids</li>
            <li> but MOOM has completely saved my life.</li>
            <li> You are pulling hair out by the root in sensitive areas, sooooo</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavendar version for sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li> I heated it for 15 seconds (even though the manual says you don&#x27;t really need to do this for facial applications)</li>
            <li> As someone with horribly sensitive skin, I decided to give in and try waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Keeps skin soft</li>
            <li> I bought this at a natural food store</li>
            <li> This Moom product is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gone to a salon to be professionally waxed as well as done it myself with products from walgreens and also with nads.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use, simple to do yourself and very efficient.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s still so much product left</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and everything I have ever used has caused problems for me.</li>
            <li> Do some prepping before hand - the day before waxing, exfoliate skin to remove dead skin and moisturize lightly ( i like to use coconut</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was fast shipping</li>
            <li> No irritation afterwords which really surprised me</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally done.  </li>
            <li> think you really need to understand how waxing works and how to apply the solution and all that for this to work properly for you.</li>
            <li> to a very understandable no return policy on Amazon for this product, I went to Moom itself to get info on shipping it back.  </li>
            <li> my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back yet, it DOES miss hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be very similar to wax, removing the hair with not too terribly much pain.</li>
            <li> but, overall, the appearance is much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> (170 g) 100% Natural Hair Remover.&lt;br /&gt;18</li>
            <li> As far as waxing the underarms and Bikini area, it did</li>
            <li> This was used so far to remove excess eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> I switched to Moom after I was burnt at a salon getting my eyebrows waxed, since then I have had insanely sensitive skin in the area</li>
            <li> (I am sensitive anyway)</li>
            <li> and I think the hair is not growing back as much.</li>
            <li> but after you figure it out it actually works and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as waxing.</li>
            <li> you do have to let your hair get pretty long for it to work well.</li>
            <li> I had bought this just for my upper lip, but I really like it</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really wish I could have my money back.</li>
            <li> The first time my hair growth was about a month long</li>
            <li> Natural scent.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t pull it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;re using it on a sensitive</li>
            <li> Definitely heat it up in the microwave vs in hot water, though be careful it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a wax so we&#x27;ll see how long it works.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell with this</li>
            <li> (oh yeah, and rinses off completely with water... not the end of the world here)</li>
            <li> But the pain really isn&#x27;t avoidable for coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bits that cleave onto your skin even after a shower as it is just natural sugar.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You have to do it fast and parallel to the surface.</li>
            <li> the wax directly to your skin.</li>
            <li> otherwise it won&#x27;t work nearly as well</li>
            <li> I had tried this same type of product for unwanted facial hair before without success, but decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> wax is extremely sticky and kind of stringy, so be cautious when opening it, otherwise you&#x27;re gonna have a wax mess</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of tries to get the trick, but if you follow the directions carefully you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately you really do have to go without shaving for two weeks for this to work effectively.</li>
            <li> The good reviews are all fake.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to warm it for the face, but you can still spread it fairly thin.  </li>
            <li> I find that when the consistency is like thick syrup - its easiest to spread thinly which helps pick up the hair best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product left behind a good amount of hair in all of the areas.</li>
            <li> see other reviewers complaining that this doesn&#x27;t remove fine hairs -- traditional wax won&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> In that event, I do pop it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds and then wait for it cool down</li>
            <li> Wow, to my surprise, no dark area anywhere!  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how quickly the wax cooled down, by time I was ready it was already turning white.</li>
            <li> It really is nicer to be able to do this at home without worrying about the wax dripping down your eyebrow and causing you to wax off half an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> This wax is better the other wax products I have tried because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and its the only one I have found that I have actually gotten to work.</li>
            <li> I did experience some very minor and not visible bruising with use, but as this was my first time it could have been an error on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sugar based, we even reuse the strips by letting them soak in hot water, rinsing them, and letting them air dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, my girlfriend and I are addicted to waxing each other.</li>
            <li> Superior to other &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; hair removers as it is much easier to use (but read the directions!), less messy, and no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> True, there was no mess, and it hurt less.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few sessions and many hours to finally be hair free, and the hair came back in less time than if I had depilated.</li>
            <li> Stick to the gold standard in hair removal - classic old sugaring.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s also why it hurts less, because it has such a strong hold.    </li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not as harsh as hot wax.</li>
            <li> At least not one that  a little warm water can&#x27;t take care of!    </li>
            <li> NO it will not get all the hair at once regardless, even at a professional place - hair grows at different rates and lengths which is why salons will have you come back for a follow up if you&#x27;re a first timer.</li>
            <li> no mess what so ever.</li>
            <li> Overall, when it did successfully grab hair, it removed it completely and wholly; however, it does tend to leave patches unless I was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- When you put the waxed cloth on the body part your targeting, just tap and rub it a few times gently, making sure its in place, that also slightly warms the wax.</li>
            <li> Even though the process is messy, clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li> I was still using big strips, and so I was coming up with a decent amount of hair, but</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my legs and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Particularly with the Moom because they don&#x27;t give you enough strips or Moom stuff to do it all at once.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I&#x27;ve only used epilators so my pain tolerance might be slightly higher than someone with no experience with depilation.</li>
            <li> I just used this kit for the first time to wax my upper lip and eyebrows and I am totally sold on it.  </li>
            <li> I know Moom makes a mens gel, but the main ingredients are the same, plus my wife plans on using it too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, fair-skinned, fair-haired with normal not edpecially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I just wasn&#x27;t following the directions, but I read it, reread it, re-applied the wax over and over again, but this item is totally trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of afraid to get it too hot.</li>
            <li> It was sticky and messy and caused me more pain than I had felt in a long time.</li>
            <li> Normally the fabric for the large and small strips is of a lightweight muslin; however, in the kit I received, the large strips are of a heavier weight muslin.  </li>
            <li> I am really impressed with that part - other types I&#x27;ve used generally get cold and harden up after just a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> The hairs grew back MUCH finer, in fact, it was hard to even see the hairs in the mirror they were so fine.  </li>
            <li> After applying the strip, I would wait about 10 seconds before removing it to give the sugar time to cool off a little.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never gotten it quite right any other way.</li>
            <li> this was pretty easy to use with little mess.  </li>
            <li> It just does NOT work -- on the legs one would have to do the same spot over and over again to see any good results; and for eyebrows - simply useless: it does not pick up the tiny hair -- which is the whole point of waxing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> (it does NOT cool quickly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kinda messy to apply (&#x27;strings&#x27; everywhere), but cleanup is easy enough.</li>
            <li> There are two sizes of strips- small and HUGE</li>
            <li> Keeping a wet cloth nearby will help the process go more smoothly since sticky fingers make it difficult.</li>
            <li> it makes life so much easier and the hair stays gone for a long time.</li>
            <li> You stay hair free for a long time compared to shaving which actually makes waxing save you time in the long run.</li>
            <li> The results were about the same, only more messy.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this if your hair is long enough, but if not, normal waxing would be better.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the directions and exactly followed them, and tried again on 3 separate occasions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did hurt a bit, but I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything else, so I am not sure what kind of pain I&#x27;d get with other products...</li>
            <li> (I normally use wax strips for my upper lip).    </li>
            <li> , the wax in the center can be hot; 4) trim the hair to 1cm, any longer</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using and don&#x27;t overheat in microwave, as I burned my finger the first time using it.  </li>
            <li> Place the waxed strip on wherever you&#x27;re hairy and press in, making sure to rub the back of the strip back and forth a few times.</li>
            <li> Even upon repeated application I could not get all of the hairs as I normally would with regular wax.</li>
            <li> The directions are spot-on, though it could clarify how quickly you should be pulling and other minor details for people new to waxing-type hair</li>
            <li> I just wash them right after use and dry them for next time.</li>
            <li> It works very much the same way as wax, but smells much better and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was afraid it would.</li>
            <li> The whole hair follicle comes out and it takes a considerable long time to grow (about the same time when you get waxed professionally).</li>
            <li> The wax itself was not a really good one, and it gets cool down easily.</li>
            <li> Not as painful as the other stuff I tried and so much more effective.</li>
            <li> It really lasts long!</li>
            <li> at a time, apply a very thin coat, use quickly so it doesn&#x27;t cool down too quick.</li>
            <li> But as far as effectiveness - not a single hair was missed for me.</li>
            <li> So much better than hard wax!</li>
            <li> is smooth and with no irritation, minimal bleeding, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> It got all the hairs, clean up was simple, and it hurt WAY less.</li>
            <li> It really is a sugar wax, similar to what Middle Eastern women have used for centuries: since 1900 BC, Wikipedia says!</li>
            <li> because it left my legs itchy and red and really irritated.</li>
            <li> It is so sticky, though -- whether it&#x27;s warm or cold, the wax stays very sticky.</li>
            <li> You cannot twist the cap back on because the wax never fully hardens -- it stays sticky so you just have to sort of gently lay the cap back on the container.</li>
            <li> You will definitely need 2 of them and you will probably have to use it over multiple days to really get the hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this item should come with more strips.</li>
            <li> so if this makes it longer then even a week and a half its worth the money already.</li>
            <li> For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much.</li>
            <li> However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well.</li>
            <li> Then wait for like 2-3 seconds (gives time for the sugar to settle) and pull with a quick firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then wait for like 2-3 seconds (gives time for the sugar to settle) and pull with a quick firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to figure this out, but I love it now.</li>
            <li> Moom got virtually all my hairs, minus a few strays that I plucked with tweezers when I was done...even better than the at home waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It didnt hurt like at all, but it was super messy</li>
            <li> I grew the hair out for 2 weeks prior to using and the hair was a little more than 1/8 inch long.</li>
            <li> The directions do say to let your hair grow out a certain length, but that&#x27;s just not realistic when it&#x27;s spring time in Texas.</li>
            <li> more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the first time the other day on my upper lip (which I&#x27;ve never done before) and WOW, it seriously didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blisters after waxing.</li>
            <li> and then I have very sensitive skin, so I had to deal with red skin for days.. &lt;</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin was left very soft.</li>
            <li> The pubic hair region is a little more painful than the underarms, but after a while I really did not feel it because I was more focused on getting the hair removed than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This wax barely removes any hair!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again, my sensitive skin has no complaints!</li>
            <li> I warmed it in the microwave and was shocked how long it stayed warm!!</li>
            <li> I want to thank moom for creating a product with such natural, non harmful ingredients!</li>
            <li> and so the next time I followed the directions completely and was amazed by the results!</li>
            <li> Definitely use the corn starch on the skin before &amp;#34;mooming.&amp;#34; It is kind of annoying to have to reheat the product several times during use, but other than that it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> so it took a couple of tries to get it right, by my third time waxing</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re done, you just rinse the strips in hot water and lay them out to dry for next time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The sides of my calves are now starting to feel like carpet because I&#x27;m so anxious to try it on my legs that I&#x27;ve stopped shaving and started covering them up(not easy since its summer</li>
            <li> The reusable strips wash off so easily, and that was a feature I was pretty skeptical about.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time using an at home wax (or waxing at all), I thought my first failure may have been my fault.  </li>
            <li> It would remove the very fine hair but even with repeated uses, still did not remove the stubborn coarse hair which is always the most annoying to deal with.  </li>
            <li> This product will obviously work differently for every person, but if you read the instructions a few times and get a clear idea of the process in your head before you try it, I truly believe things will go smoothly.</li>
            <li> (I went slowly since this was my first time doing a full wax on myself, but I imagine that next time it should only take me about 15 minutes.)  </li>
            <li> Once I used a very thin layer of the mixture instead of the thick clump I started out doing and got the hang of how to lift, it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I follow the instructions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, and have tried every which way to get it to work (leaving the strip on longer, using more, using less, re-doing it, rubbing the strip harder, softer, etc.,) and it DOES get rid of some hair, but definitely not all of them.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried the waxing route before, but I was tired of plucking and the other reviews were good.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me on my ultra thin leg hairs, but it&#x27;s nice enough for other areas.</li>
            <li> The package includes both large and small sticks as well as large and small strips (though not enough of them - but fortunately I have a bunch of strips a friend gave</li>
            <li> I find it easiest to lay them in a shallow bowl of hot water so the wax loosens up, and then rub the wax off to clean them and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> So far, only her legs have shown this problem, but it&#x27;s still a major inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I am left with a large red area on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I recently became a mom again just as my only child was off to high school..</li>
            <li> Ripping the strip - with one hand, pull your skin taut in the opposite direction of hair growth, while the other hand quickly rips the strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth (just like ripping off</li>
            <li> Almost just the same as any other wax, seemed extra super sticky though...</li>
            <li> Granted, my hair is not extraordinarily thick (i&#x27;m eastern european) or coarse, but the pain was nothing like the excruciating horror stories I heard--</li>
            <li> And make sure your hair is at least 1/4&#x27; in long before you wax</li>
            <li> By morning even though my lips were red-the next day it was clear and then I took a shower.</li>
            <li> Just be careful because it heats up quite fast in the microwave</li>
            <li> but for sensitive areas such as underarms, bikini, and face?</li>
            <li> but for sensitive areas such as underarms, bikini, and face?</li>
            <li> , my red-headed daughter tried to get professionally waxed and ended up very red, irritated and bruised.</li>
            <li> Left her skin soft and its been 2 weeks, no sign of regrowth</li>
            <li> Having never waxed before, I am not in a position to say how the pain compares, but I will say that I was surprised by the excruciating pain I endured whilst mooming previously only shaved areas.</li>
            <li> It barely took the hair off the legs.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this for anyone looking for natural waxes.</li>
            <li> I never waxed my legs before and have only gotten my arms and armpits professionally waxed twice.</li>
            <li> If your not careful with wax you could also pull off skin along with hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to wait weeks to remove the hair, I could barely stand the one week.</li>
            <li> (really just crushed up Asprin, witch hazel and alcohol).  </li>
            <li> Wax also used to leave my skin red and irritated for hours, even when done by a professional.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used barely any of it...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;ll bare my husband any children...</li>
            <li> O_o  </li>
            <li> Granted, you&#x27;ll need to buy bigger strips and more product to do larger areas, but that is common sense...    </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so doing it over the same area hurts.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing so far that I have ever used, therefore I can&#x27;t compare it to waxing.</li>
            <li> It took forever and the 6oz jar I bought would not be near enough.</li>
            <li> I paid around $13 for a complete kit with two different size strips, sticks, instruction booklet, and a glass jar of the sugar</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely, a couple times, but it wouldn&#x27;t remove the tiny hairs I have.</li>
            <li> After dabbing the wax into my eyebrow hairs, I pulled my skin back and peeled off the strip as fast as possible (in the opposite direction of hair growth) and all the hairs literally came out!</li>
            <li> so when this stuff pulled it out i was :O</li>
            <li> I took a shower and my skin was not as nearly as sensitive as with regular wax.</li>
            <li> But with Moom, barely any hair came out, if any.</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft and lighter skinned.</li>
            <li> It will remove hairs, but you will probably end up with patchy skin hair as you wait a couple of day to go back to your old remover.</li>
            <li> Also, as I vaguely mentioned above, I do heat it up in the microwave so that it is more spreadable, but I do wait for it to go back to room temperature first.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it worked sometimes it go barely any hair.</li>
            <li> If you make a mistake with Moom, even if it is a spill, wet the wash cloth with hot water from the tap, squeeze the extra from the cloth and wipe.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;While difficult, it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> it is extremely difficult to use alone,m effectively.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend laughed at me the other day because I seem to be coming up with random other places to wax for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> if the honey-like thing doesn&#x27;t completely become cold, the effort may not be such good.</li>
            <li> It gives me a freshly waxed smooth finish on my neck and chin and the few hairs that were left, I used a small electric razor to clip.</li>
            <li> Then ensure the area is completely dry and oil free, sometimes I dust a little baby powder over the area to ensure all oil is gone.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of redness (above my eyebrow on the side that was affected by shingles), but the redness quickly went away.</li>
            <li> Being a first time waxer, I was down to try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used microwaveable body wax (sticky and complicated to get ready), naturally bare honey wax (natural, but extremely sticky/messy and hard to grasp the clear strips), wax strips (easy to use, but more wasteful than I&#x27;d like) and cream/gel hair removers (also gross).     </li>
            <li> it only left me red for a little less than a day (a great improvement over any other hair removal product).  </li>
            <li> This was my first time waxing, MOOm is so simple and easy to use that you cant go wrong for buying it.</li>
            <li> If anything it only made more of a mess and made it harder to properly apply the cloth.  </li>
            <li> I laid down the second swipe of wax, I made SURE to use MUCH less.</li>
            <li> stuff is so amazing, easy, and less painful.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> The other reason it didn&#x27;t work the first time is that I followed instructions and only warmed it for 10 seconds at a time which did not bring it to a state for spreading for me -</li>
            <li> , I had taken a warm bath at least 45 minutes before trying Moom, I applied a thin layer, I only quickly rubbed 3 times over the length of the strip, waited a few seconds, held the skin taut and ripped oft the stop as I have always done before hundreds of times with other wax lines (which have all worked fine for me).</li>
            <li> Its nicer than regular wax it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad just make sure you read the application instructions before your first usage if you never used the product before its not like your normal wax kit.</li>
            <li> I bought another kit the other day for my daughter-after seeing how well it works and how much it&#x27;ll save on salon waxing-</li>
            <li> First couple of times you&#x27;ll mess up</li>
            <li> I used this on my husband&#x27;s chest and pulled out most of his hair, but I know the fault of it was because they were too long and curly to pull out all at once, but once again its growing back slowly and for him, it beats the chore of shaving/</li>
            <li> With all the good reviews here I assume this is because I am not letting it grow long enough, but I just can&#x27;t go several weeks with hairy legs waiting for the hair to get long enough to remove (not sure how long that would take).</li>
            <li> It works awesome too even on the thick bikini area hairs and grabs them all as long as its used properly (a thin strip of wax!).</li>
            <li> Next strip a little better with a slight groan and shriek afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I can see what other reviewers mean that it&#x27;s so easy, it makes you want to wax it all!</li>
            <li> (I had never waxed myself before), just as or less painful than in the salon, and it actually works great!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing sensitive areas, use the smaller strips so you&#x27;re not yanking as much hair and therefore have less pain to deal with at a time until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> did notice, through pain induced misted eyes that I did NOT have the same red bumps or ingrown hair issues as I get with shaving, and as sensitive as the skin is</li>
            <li> did notice, through pain induced misted eyes that I did NOT have the same red bumps or ingrown hair issues as I get with shaving, and as sensitive as the skin is</li>
            <li> I just used it today (about 30 min ago) and the red spot I had near my upper lip is gone.    </li>
            <li> and I only used up a third of the wax so far.     </li>
            <li> I love that this stuff is non-toxic, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about inhaling its smell or letting it near my coochie.     </li>
            <li> Did not really remove hair very well for me, I tried different techniques to no avail.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re waxing sensitive areas for the first time (like the bikini area), use the small strips designated for your eyebrows/lip/chin.   </li>
            <li> Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> They recommend heating it up, but only so you can spread it more thinly.</li>
            <li> The pain only lasted for a few seconds, and this was absolutely worth the results.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I found that I was spreading it TOO thin, and it wasn&#x27;t working at all at first.  </li>
            <li> Would take off some hair, but most of it was left behind.</li>
            <li> The major hurdle is the temperature - Moom, I would pay extra for one of those temperature thingys etched into the side of the glass jar.  </li>
            <li> my stomach and chest (dense, coarse hair) was very painful to do but the results were excellent</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my skin at all (initial redness at first as always but gone in like half an hour).</li>
            <li> Also I had a slight irritation on my upper lip after all (I imagine from pulling the hair off a place for the first time)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very effective on facial hair, and not as painful as I imagined</li>
            <li> With this, because it doesn&#x27;t wax your skin, you can jump in the shower really quick if you get a little goopy( because this stuff doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin), wash off, pat dry and have another go.</li>
            <li> I plan to wait and see how long it takes for the irritation to clear up.</li>
            <li> I also came across some other promising things I could try my next time</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, I was trying it out to find and alternative to the other waxes, but I ended up using what was left over of my Sally Hansen kit to finish what Moom could not.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t that stubborn (thank goodness) but I can see where this product would work well where other, more common products may not.</li>
            <li> My issues came with the actual ripping process, because apparently I am a wimp when doing it to myself.</li>
            <li> Now the reason for the low score: there was not even enough product for one lower leg (I&#x27;m not exactly beastly hairy), not many waxing strips or tongue depressors provided (trying to get you into buying more of their products)</li>
            <li> It barely removed any hairs, probably only 5% of them.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe the hairs were not long</li>
            <li> I barely made a dent in the jar, so it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> At least one promise held true.</li>
            <li> At least one promise held true.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m disabled; my disability makes it a challenge to control my body.</li>
            <li> Just soak them in hot water for a few minutes, wring them out, and throw them in the dryer.</li>
            <li> I was careful to follow directions specifically; however, this product caused hair breakage (instead of pulling out by the root) and the absolute WORST case of ingrown hairs/red bumps I have ever experienced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using moon hair removal wax for 3 ears since I first read about it in The Green Beauty</li>
            <li> First time user trying to save money at home turns into messy disaster with pain.</li>
            <li> It always leaves behind hair which kind of defeats my whole purpose of using it at the beginning, I guess my hair is a bit too thick for it?</li>
            <li> It certainly does not work with hair less than 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> If I do make a little mess with this product, it washes off quite easily with water.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very easy to clean up, re-usable strips, was not too painful (much less painful than home laser which i also tried for a short time), did not leave any kind of rash or reaction on my skin (a little redness in the pores faded in a couple of hours).</li>
            <li> but after it colds down the effort is very well.</li>
            <li> Less painful than waxing and a lot more effective than other methods of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> At least for me it was less pain as long as i kept it at a nice \\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistency.</li>
            <li> several other reviewers have mentioned, also be sure to follow the directions carefully:  using some baby powder, applying a very thin layer in the direction of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice thick consistency at room temperature and based on that thins out with just a very little bit of warming.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, it was the most painful experience EVER.</li>
            <li> There is definitely pain involved, as expected, but it&#x27;s much better than trying to tweeze the hairs off, fast, and the least messy waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for</li>
            <li> And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for you.      </li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and just heated slightly, applied the cloth and then gently pulled.  </li>
            <li> It left my lip itchy and red and barely took any hair off.</li>
            <li> I have had a few instances of bleeding from the hair follicle (it was not ripped skin), but I think it&#x27;s because some of the roots were pretty deep.</li>
            <li> You tend to get lazy when it starts to get thick again, but its way easier to spread when warm.  </li>
            <li> When it is finally spread thoroughly yet only a thing layer (as per directions), as I pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth, barely any hair came out!</li>
            <li> It is a little messy, but it washes off everything easily.</li>
            <li> And it works effectively, with very little mess or pain, just as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> It really does what it promises to do, painless, fast, and the truth is the hair does come back less and less.  </li>
            <li> Or, maybe the hairs were not long enough?  </li>
            <li> The kit has a glass container with 6 oz of product, about 10 or more long fabric strips, a few little strips, and wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> This worked great on my (south asian, thick, dark) hair and had lots of benefits over these other products, including that it dissolves with just water, so you aren&#x27;t left with sticky stuff all over your face, it left my face feeling soft and with no red spots, and it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this, if you&#x27;re new to waxing it might hurt but it will hurt a hell of a lot less than with any other.</li>
            <li> : Btw I only use this for my bikini area (the whole area) and sometimes under arms, for everything else I use an epilator machine.lso slightly warms the wax.</li>
            <li> The problem is, as much as I wanted to use and love this product, the kit is almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it on my legs in the near future since shaving my legs leaves stubble and has to be done every single day.</li>
            <li> Separate into smaller sections; for underarms, I do one half downward (lower half), the other upward, and one more for the entire armpit upward.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to wax for my legs, it may hurt a little more but at least it works.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go back and catch the little stray ones as much.  </li>
            <li> It is messy to work with, hard to apply, even when heated, does not spread smoothly and an all around a dud!  </li>
            <li> My first 2 attempts were definitely user error, and apparently hair that had been previously shaved is extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s basically my favorite way of using this product, less messiness, less product wasting (for both the sugar and the cloths) and MUCH less</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s basically my favorite way of using this product, less messiness, less product wasting (for both the sugar and the cloths) and MUCH less</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that the company took the time to give instructions for each different area you could use the wax on, as there are small differences which can apparently increase your accuracy.</li>
            <li> Gloopy and thick does not equal success here.</li>
            <li> I really really tried hard to make this work for me and the only thing i did not follow is the half an inch of hair they wanted you to grow out first.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really hard to keep it constantly at the right temperature so that it works as supposed to.</li>
            <li> However, this product does not work on me, it is very messy and took me more than 30mins just to remove hair from a small part.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t rip skin off in other places i tried later though, the upper lip is just really sensitive</li>
            <li> It was very hard getting a clean swipe to remove all the hair on the body surface.</li>
            <li> I tried this with high hopes that it would work for me and it did nothing but give me little red bumps on my chin and upper lip area.</li>
            <li> and I wish it wasn&#x27;t so late because I would head to the store right now and pick up the jar so I could finish the skin</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works if you have very light thin hairs, but if yours are coarse or dark DO NOT buy this.</li>
            <li> If its not hot enough the applicator just pulls on your hairs (like a bandaid on a hairy area), so either way youre out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After burning myself, having hairs ripped instead of pulled out, and patches of clear areas, I gave up on this product and threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy the pre-waxed strips again though they left this awful residue on my skin, this was nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Cloth strips are hard to clean and not very thick&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing and less mess because it&#x27;s completely dissolvable in water.</li>
            <li> I did half the upper lip first, then the other.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can be slightly messy, but if you are careful it is easily manageable because it comes off with water (and perhaps a little bit of soap).  </li>
            <li> Moom was super easy-to-use--similar to the honey wax, but much less messy (even when I heated it).</li>
            <li> and they said that they still use the same fabric for both the large and small strips.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly how you want to feel when waxing sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Everyone that is giving this a negative review obviously has issues with reading directions in a product manual (located inside the box) and following instructions EXACTLY how they are written.........</li>
            <li> It is a nice but not Enough entire body and the price is very expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not as painful, but the hair grows back so fast, in ONE week it&#x27;s back!</li>
            <li> My reasonably high pain tolerance was no match for the thickest of my dark hairs, and I would suggest practicing on less sensitive areas before giving yourself a brazilian (regrettably I do speak from experience).</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult for me to use this though because my skin is sensitive and I can only do a little bit of my face at a time or my face is tomato red for around four or more hours (even with applying a moisturizer and staying out of the sun).</li>
            <li> It works very well for removing the bulk of my unwanted eyebrow hairs, with a very little bit of tidying with the tweezers the next day after the swelling has subsided.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the clean up was easier and the product wasn&#x27;t harsh like soft wax, it failed at removing hair on high school girls and the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more painful spreading it on the hair then actually ripping, and you have to buy new fabric strips everytime.</li>
            <li> I had a small wet towel with me so every time I had the product left over on the skin I removed right away before moving on.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> More fun is less painful.</li>
            <li> Of course, there is some pain involved, especially when you are removing thicker hairs, but for those areas, I recommend you do it in small sections so that the pain will not be as much every time you pull the strip.</li>
            <li> I feel dumb now for spending so much on getting waxed professionally!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to over warm it, I have to microwave it for less than recommended on the package or it&#x27;s too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moom since this past May only on my bikini area, and after reading the instructions I was ready to try it.</li>
            <li> is small, so I used about 1/5 to do the whole Brazilian + underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use regular wax anymore</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not hot/heated enough - where you can put it back in the microwave for another 3 seconds or so - this will not work dry; b) the strip is not being removed quickly enough.  </li>
            <li> If you want a long lasting method of hair removal that is simple to use then get this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is different lengths and some wasn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the popsicle stick applicators, I use a small cake decorating spatula, which nicely spreads the thin layer needed and helps the product go farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair might be slightly more tenacious than average, but not THAT much worse.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you are tired of new growth within 2 days from razors, constantly get burned from Veet/Nair, and you are open to something different.  </li>
            <li> So if wax does typically work for you, maybe just consider: This stuff doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> The only down side was that after I had been using it for a couple months it developed this caramel candy like texture and didn&#x27;t work well --</li>
            <li> Like most people, I get sick of shaving pretty quickly and decided to use this as an alternative to straight up waxing, which I have had bad experiences with.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> how much hair comes out with every strip, and with very little pain.  </li>
            <li> Finally I decided to give it another try on my stomach, an area with hairs easier to pick up than my face but less sensitive than my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed before myself, only professionally done, so I was slightly nervous to try it out.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it goes a long way, and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> but I really like it (even without it working if that makes sense :/).</li>
            <li> However, this size was really small, I could not epilate my whole leg with it</li>
            <li> Sticky and didn&#x27;t really remove anything, wasted of money!</li>
            <li> I gently patted a small section of fabric on to the area with Moom, and HOLDING MY SKIN</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is natural, but its no fun to bleed copious amounts every time you wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you how it goes and how long until the hair comes back.</li>
            <li> if the hair is too long or short the product won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been in the beauty industry for a LONG time and have tried several types of waxing.</li>
            <li> It has only removed long hair efficiently.</li>
            <li> The results also don&#x27;t last long - two weeks max</li>
            <li> A pack of those will last a long while.</li>
            <li> Too short, and they wont get picked up.. too long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my legs waxed for about 2 months and the hairs were long enough to wax.</li>
            <li> so a box doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> but it was long enough</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found out how long the results will last yet.</li>
            <li> My first layer was WAY too thick.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the pain was not really bad at all with this product, but I built it up in my head each time, which made the experience worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li> But, hot wax always scalded my delicate eyebrow skin and left it dry and scaley.  </li>
            <li> The new package came with heavy, muslin-looking strips but they&#x27;re stiff and highly ineffective.</li>
            <li> Really follow the directions and 1) don&#x27;t use too much wax, just enough to spread it very thinly</li>
            <li> And because waxing is sooooo time consuming, I think I&#x27;m just gonna throw in the towel, splurge a little and get my professionally done this summer!</li>
            <li> Also my skin is so sensitive that I had to switch from waxing to threading, which lasts less time.</li>
            <li> * thoroughly dry the area before waxing and if necessary, keep a tissue with you to wipe off areas that may get wet/damp again (like underarms)   </li>
            <li> By the next day they should be dry.  </li>
            <li> By the next day they should be dry.  </li>
            <li> My previous product was Body Shop&#x27;s Sugarings, but when they took that off the market, I had to go to the professional salon.</li>
            <li> Just make sure if you are cutting up the strips to make smaller ones to use pinking shears so the fabric doesn&#x27;t fray.</li>
            <li> I waxed half my leg and it felt like 2 day old stubble.</li>
            <li> After doing everything according to direction several times, I only ended up with a really red patch of skin with less than a third of the hair pulled out.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not really ballsy enough to wax my legs, so I only did part of one of my legs...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to spread it out super thin</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painless but I have felt worse zipping off a super stuck adhesive bandage.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, blonde hair</li>
            <li> I am blonde and have very thin fine hair, I used this to get the thinker hairs</li>
            <li> but I was surprised with an almost healed-up fully small cut being torn open to the point of bleeding (it was almost all the way healed, no scab left even), and the sensitivity of the bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs (after I let my hair grow out for 2 weeks like it said to do) but only removed some of the hair and not very much of it.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out after my first session that I still ended up with the unsightly whiteheads the next day (and of course a few more in the days to follow).  </li>
            <li> The cream I&#x27;m currently using doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair like I wish it would, but at least it doesn&#x27;t burn me like some have - I end up having to pluck a few stragglers, which kind of sucks,</li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical when I read the reviews that it hurts less than wax and how easily it washes off!  </li>
            <li> The sugar adhered to 99% of the hairs this time and it only took me half the time that it usually does because all the hair was removed the first time.</li>
            <li> , I only got about 2/3 of the way done before I had to just give up not only due to being sticky, but because the darn container cooled</li>
            <li> , I only got about 2/3 of the way done before I had to just give up not only due to being sticky, but because the darn container cooled</li>
            <li> I had tried other facial hair removers and they actually burned her face.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other wax and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> however for those who are not familiar with this or for those who are first time, this might really be a little though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other notes: If doing a large area like legs, you will need at least 2 jars I would recommend getting 3.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other waxing products, I was really disappointed with the hair removal, the messiness, and how incredibly sticky they were.  </li>
            <li> as well which are really nothing more than wooden popsicle sticks or tongue depressors, again one set thin and the other wide (I use the thin one).</li>
            <li> I also liked that it wipes off with cold water, as opposed to oil-based removers required with conventional wax.</li>
            <li> It was super easy on the legs, armpits were very painful.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, but the issue with the chin and the redness is the reason for the 4/5, as it&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment for me in that respect.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my arms, although was kind of painful to put it ON and spread it out.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about self-waxing, but now that I have used Moom I can&#x27;t see myself ever going to get a professional wax again.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and had to get my hair waxed off by a professional.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enoughthat when applying the sugar, the sugar absolutely must be proper consistency, paper thin, and in the correct direction, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t grab the hair properly.</li>
            <li> grows 0,5cm long before i can wax it off</li>
            <li> I searched for a long time to find a sugaring product I can use.  </li>
            <li> and watch out if you heat it too long</li>
            <li> Maybe its because they&#x27;re so long but come on I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7, so that doesn&#x27;t make me an amazon</li>
            <li> they have a long Youtube video that tells you how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a LONG time to do this.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m no professional at waxing techniques</li>
            <li> I think I will wait and try again since I&#x27;ve waited this long.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes some practice, but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Messy and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sensitive to pain</li>
            <li> A person won&#x27;t have to wait for it to get so long because the hair will be finer and release easier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try to give an update on how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> so i didnt know how long to keep it on or what,</li>
            <li> I have been using sugar for a long time and everytime</li>
            <li> This might work for hair that is longer, but if you didn&#x27;t want hair in an area, why would you let it get that long before removing it???  </li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because I received the product earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Four months ago I spent $12 on this product and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get it off</li>
            <li> and I disagree only because I am inexperienced.</li>
            <li> me multiple tries to remove anything at all&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Wish it was possible to give minus 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to wait until it was 1/4 inch long, I wouldn&#x27;t bother to remove it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF YOU LEAVE IT FOR TOO LONG IN THE MICROWAVE</li>
            <li> Only microwave it 5-10 sec.</li>
            <li> (but you will have some long strings of honey from the jar to your body, so be prepared with a wet cloth to wipe your hands and any surfaces as necessary).</li>
            <li> The first area I tried to wax was my legs and although it grabbed a lot of the hair it still left a lot behind</li>
            <li> It really works, and you don&#x27;t need to apply thick layers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> It was so much less painful than hard wax, easier to use than the honey wax, and more precise than the pre-made wax strips.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended using this on dry, uncleaned hair for better, less painful experience.</li>
            <li> It was much less effective cold</li>
            <li> My last issue with this product compared to the salon wax, is that the hair started growing back within a week and a half.</li>
            <li> baby powder to keep your skin dry if necessary, the wax won&#x27;t work on wet or sweaty skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> did my lower right leg using just a paper thin amount as indicated on the directions.</li>
            <li> I have tried several methods of heating it up: putting the jar in a pot with water on the stove (probably not a good idea to do it without the water!), running hot water over the (closed jar) from the sink, and briefly running the hair dryer over it.</li>
            <li> I am very new to the waxing/sugaring world - I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows waxed and used cold wax strips on my bikini line once; therefore, I was pretty nervous about using this product.</li>
            <li> stopped shaving the end of last summer because it had become such a mess.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to epilating because I just couldn&#x27;t afford monthly waxes anymore, and the mess of doing it at home was enough of a deterrent to me.  </li>
            <li> But from my standpoint, Moom (and likely many other home waxing kits are simply not worth the time, mess, and poor results -- beware</li>
            <li> It still looks like normal wax, so it is a little messy but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> , you might want to buy some wooden craft sticks or tongue depressors from your local crafts section, because if you&#x27;re waxing a small area, the couple of sticks that come in the package won&#x27;t last you nearly as long as the jar of wax.</li>
            <li> morning I set everything up and prepared for a long agonizing process and found it not to be so at all!</li>
            <li> This is mostly due to my bodily issues; I found that my hands were getting a bit sticky when I was rubbing the strip before pulling, but also when my body was jerking around, I was getting the product all over my arms, hands and oxygen tubing.</li>
            <li> i usually have to repeat the process three times to get all the little spots that didn&#x27;t work the first time through.  </li>
            <li> All of them worked to loosen up the wax to different degrees, and I only tried the last two because I was too lazy to turn on the stove.     </li>
            <li> The hair removing was almost pain-free (especially compared to other methods).</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend this to other women.</li>
            <li> Upon trying Moom, however, I immediately noticed how different this is from the other waxing products.  </li>
            <li> a couple of days later I tried the other leg...</li>
            <li> the 6 oz jar was just enough to get some small areas on my back and my entire chest/stomach.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s liquid enough that when you apply it to your skin and place the cloth over it, the two things don&#x27;t adhere to each other.</li>
            <li> I will try other areas and update my review later.    </li>
            <li> I was a little red but not a big deal at all.  </li>
            <li> the whole process was messy and full of disappointment.</li>
            <li> Again, because I have such coarse hair, I bled a little bit, and I stopped after 30 hairs or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed, but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It gave me the same result every other solution has.</li>
            <li> Getting a little addictive, the third try elicited a growl from beginning to end.  </li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> I totally believe this is partly due to my luck in finding this brand of wax.</li>
            <li> you can handle a little bit of pain, use the wax cold instead of warm.</li>
            <li> Did not make me break out much (which is very common every time I wax my upper lip).</li>
            <li> kit comes with a small tub of the Moom product itself, 12 large muslin strips, 6 small muslin strips, 2 large popsicle sticks, and 2 small popsicle sticks.  </li>
            <li> However I expected a heck of a lot more than what I actually got.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to a T. First off, heating it only ten seconds did not do a thing to it, it was a terrible mess.</li>
            <li> You can wash, dry and reuse the muslin fabric strips</li>
            <li> Dry the area with cornstarch or baby powder.</li>
            <li> You will probably have to wash the strips, wait for them to dry</li>
            <li> It was easy to clean since its a sugar base!!</li>
            <li> The least painful of all the wax I have used and produces great results.</li>
            <li> You can rinse the strips and spreaders, then lay them on the towel to dry.  </li>
            <li> Once dry you can reapply the Moom.  </li>
            <li> You can rinse the strips and spreaders, then lay them on the towel to dry.  </li>
            <li> Once dry you can reapply the Moom.  </li>
            <li> Instead as I would do my hair coloring I used on dry, unwashed area.</li>
            <li> I had to stop 3 times and wash and dry the strips.  </li>
            <li> (As per the manuals instructions - wash makeup and oil off your face) Keyword: WASH AND DRY FACE</li>
            <li> and I hung them to dry and use again.</li>
            <li> I just rinse all the strips and sticks, then leave them to dry.</li>
            <li> IT GOT REALLY DRY BEFORE IT CAN HIT THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> Despite the bruising and bleeding, it honestly wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected...</li>
            <li> The only problem I found was it&#x27;s trouble in retrieving the short finer hairs.</li>
            <li> However, I was getting tired of Nads&#x27; very sticky residue, especially since 1.</li>
            <li> Tired of paying so much for others to wax my facial hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 5 times on different areas and it only takes off a few hairs.</li>
            <li> For the last few years, I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilian bikini waxes at a local waxing salon, but, at the cost of $55 +</li>
            <li> What a waste of ten dollars- such a scam.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> How they have so many positive reviews I can&#x27;t imagine, but it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to fake them.</li>
            <li> The other issue is that if you take a long time with each strip, then the wax gets cold and needs to be reheated many times throughout the process.</li>
            <li> Over a year later, I am using the SAME fabric strips and still have half the jar of Moom remaining!  </li>
            <li> It did not remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> (ie: it does not remove every single hair).</li>
            <li> A SINGLE HAIR WAS PULLED.</li>
            <li> After multiple attempts, my skin was left red, raw and irritated, and yes, still hairy!</li>
            <li> for me it lasts about a week before the hair is noticeable, then takes about another half week to get long enough to wax again.</li>
            <li> I could only do half of the other lower leg with what was left in the jar.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my legs, but not good for under arm.</li>
            <li> I expect the jar that came with this package will last a long time because I only use it on small areas.</li>
            <li> Especially when the wax was on the skin, wiping off was harder with the other product.</li>
            <li> If they actually last at least 3-4 weeks then I would definitely consider repurchasing for future occasions.</li>
            <li> However, I have ran into the problem that I have pretty thin leg hair, and can&#x27;t see if I missed some until after I put lotion on.</li>
            <li> I thought I was using poor technique, but I&#x27;ve tried using it every which way: applying MOOM thin, applying it thick, applying in all different directions compared to hair growth, applying after a warm shower, pulling muslin slow, pulling it fast, pulling it off in different directions.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this multiple times, but after about 30 bloody pores later (from more than one use, I&#x27;m not suicidal)</li>
            <li> One pot lasts me a real long time.</li>
            <li> I gave Moom only 4 stars because the learning curve is a little painful, and I feel the instructions could be a bit better, but the video was definitely helpful.</li>
            <li> It pulled out maybe half of the hairs, some other hairs simply snapped, and it left a massive mess</li>
            <li> I am unable to use hot wax for hair removal due to extremely sensitive skin, which I found out the hard way after getting waxed (with what the woman said was for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> All those women claiming that they&#x27;ve managed to maintain use of the same jar of MOOM for like 6-8 months need to break down for me how they did it.</li>
            <li> The washable strips are a bonus, and you can cut the larger ones down with pinking shears if you feel the need to.  </li>
            <li> I then patted down the strip, held my skin taut, and pulled in the opposite direction of growth.</li>
            <li> I warmed up enough to get a runnier consistency but when the wax cooled down and got stickier it worked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once its boiling, bring it down to a simmer and let it cook for 20 minutes until its a deep brown.</li>
            <li> My skin was not left irritated or bumpy like with pro-waxing or other brands!  </li>
            <li> All in all, it was easy to clean up (not only with spills, but if I got it in the wrong place - no more worries about accidentally ripping off half of my eyebrow), inexpensive, surprisingly less painful (the first time I used it</li>
            <li> it took me a bit to get the technique of waxing down (not too much wax, don&#x27;t press too hard..</li>
            <li> is easy, even if you chicken out.</li>
            <li> I did one section exactly according to the instructions and couldn&#x27;t do the rest because it was much too painful.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out!</li>
            <li> There was still some bleeding from some follicles, but only in the spots that I had missed previously.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and not course, but it grabbed hair that was less than a quarter of an inch, which is the recommended length for Moom.    </li>
            <li> I just finished using the Moom on my entire face, which took about a half hour.</li>
            <li> but I found using less pressure on the cloth strip when applied is key.</li>
            <li> I ordered Moom shortly after I&#x27;d waxed, but when I got it a week later I was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> I used half of the 6oz container for a back</li>
            <li> what the hell?\\&quot; and only about half of the hair came out.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for the green, natural, organic stuff, and having said that, sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to find green, natural, organic stuff that really really works.</li>
            <li> I am about half way through if that helps so it does last</li>
            <li> so less pain is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when your skin is dry</li>
            <li> I had intended to try it out on my legs first, then graduate to the bikini area because I get some uncomfortable ingrown hairs and irritation, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the leg pain and only did one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget the hard and soft waxes - they just hurt!</li>
            <li> Waxing at the salon is super expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry, however, so, I&#x27;ll take the blame on that one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next issue to solve was a bit of a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I did make a mess initially, but you learn how to avoid drips and spills.</li>
            <li> It is costly and time-consuming going to the salon regularly and at-home waxing kits are a mess.</li>
            <li> The jar is too small to waste on my legs anyways, so I&#x27;m going to stick to the facial region only, like upper lip and stuff, since the hair is finer.</li>
            <li> Finally, since the strips are durable and made of thin fabric, I could rinse each strip in a little bowl of water immediately after I used it and it would soon be dry and ready to use again or to be put away.</li>
            <li> While the hot wax did not irritate my skin - it was tedious, messy, and hard to get the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> My only warning about this product would be that it appears to break down a little after a few uses, which makes sense considering it is made from all natural ingredients, but its definitely a product that has to be reordered every few months.</li>
            <li> I found the strips a little difficult to clean, but it did not take long.</li>
            <li> I started going to a salon after some injuries caused by self waxing a little while back.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m Asian, my hair is thin; waxing was always a hassle because my hair was never long enough.</li>
            <li> I got little red bumps from pulling hair out, but they didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> The wax is actually unusable at room temperature because it solidifies, so I have to heat it up a little bit for it to become viscous.</li>
            <li> There was a little redness the next day but organic aloe lotion helped a lot.</li>
            <li> had a little bit left in the jar and</li>
            <li> afterwards i have little red dots on my skin because of the hair getting ripped out but it disappeared in the morning.</li>
            <li> It got a little red but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hardly hurt from the first use, and it hurts less and less each time you use it.</li>
            <li> You are ripping little hairs from your body, it&#x27;s just inevitable there will be pain of some</li>
            <li> Hard wax, soft wax, wax strips.</li>
            <li> Spread it in a very thin layer, apply the muslin strip, rub it a few times, and pull the muslin strip off quickly and parallel to the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to traditional wax, but from what other reviewers say, it hurts less.</li>
            <li> Personally, the only type of wax that I have found to work unfailingly is hard wax.</li>
            <li> It works well, easy clean-up, and actually doesn&#x27;t hurt as badly as some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It gets more hair, it&#x27;s easier to cleanup, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad...</li>
            <li> I switched to the smaller strips, I was in a bit more control of the usage of them, but I also had my hands COVERED in this stupid wax.</li>
            <li> Had to do more than one pass over each section and that is just painful.</li>
            <li> It is still moderately painful but more tolerable than wax.</li>
            <li> 16 Strip(s)]], they&#x27;re much more painful and wasteful, but they work.  </li>
            <li> The process was incredibly painful, more so than what I expected</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write long reviews, but Moom is definitely the way to go!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to depilatory cream for my upper lip, as it is the least disagreeable option I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t come with enough strips.</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> Results of waxing minus the pain.</li>
            <li> so I used it again a few weeks later and TADAH....</li>
            <li> and I see absolutely NO HAIR growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely have to do a follow up wax in a few days to get the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I find that it works really well on thick and coarse hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for my brows and upper lip hair which were really thin.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;ll be back to messy sticky waxes for me.</li>
            <li> I tried on my facial hair and the honey is messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wax, then take a tweezer to the few left.</li>
            <li> I spent two hours attempting to wax my legs.</li>
            <li> get this out of the way, regardless of the reviews I read, I was expecting it to be messy, to hurt, and to not do the entire job.</li>
            <li> This time it got maybe 1/4 of the hair and left me messy and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and it only pulled out a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes does leave a few stray hairs here and there, but it&#x27;s no big deal</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re harder to grab.</li>
            <li> and I prefer it over the alternate green mixture.</li>
            <li> Minimal heat required and</li>
            <li> /clawed, it was minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time the hair was really thick and was definitely difficult to remove, but when we tried again in 5 weeks it took a third of the time/product and barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I was about to resign myself to being a fluff ball when I discovered moom.</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> And it does not take much just a thin application each time.  </li>
            <li> This product did not get all the hair as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still....in the end, not worth the cost &amp; time unless I specifically had a long trip planned.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my legs to be puffy, red and itchy for a few days, buy NOTHING.</li>
            <li> am writing this review approximately 3 weeks after I waxed my underarms and the hair is much sparser and finer.</li>
            <li> I initially gave up on this and almost threw it in the garbage as wasted money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I had heated it up enough, because I did have to go over the area a few times.</li>
            <li> again, I had absolutely not experience waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> Unlike wax, this just washes away with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> They are not thick, so I am not sure if this would work for someone with thick body hairs, but it definitely did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Since the stuff melts with water, I found that everything went a lot faster when I would dip the stick in, pull it out and then with wet fingers sort of pull the wax from the jar.    </li>
            <li> It hurt, but that is expected when you&#x27;re pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have to use it on the same area multiple times to get rid of the hair,  and my hair is not even thick.</li>
            <li> Harder to remove coarse hair (had to go over a few spots three or four</li>
            <li> I am an asian and have a very coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I found the wax too thick to apply, and found it even more difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I expect this small jar will last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> As opposed to spreading the wax on the hair directly (which I find can be messy and painful sometimes when the hair is slightly long), instead spread a thin layer of the wax on the cloth itself, making sure you have an area relative to that you&#x27;re targeting on your body.</li>
            <li> This past month I really didn&#x27;t have time to sugar and  the hair was a little longer than I would usually let it get and thought it would be too long, but I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and do the Moom anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to the salon a few times only to find it extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> On the other side, I did have a few that I kept using tweezers to pull out; then they grew back in a week or 10 days.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it is very difficult to achieve a consistency that allows for an easy spread of the sugar.</li>
            <li> I usually trust reviews, and most of the time my experience matches those of the majority, so I&#x27;m just baffled and a little sad.  </li>
            <li> The other wax hair removal kits would usually leave a mess or there would not enough acetone to remove the excess wax or not enough strips.</li>
            <li> It misses a little bit of hair, but I&#x27;m not sure any waxing kit is going to get your professional results  2)</li>
            <li> I wanted something to remove unwanted facial hair that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling raw like the wax strips that I used to use.      </li>
            <li> My skin was raw, red, bumpy, and irritated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the raw, red, tender skin with this product.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get the sugar too hot or it will be really uncomfortable and may even burn.</li>
            <li> If for example you have made a mistake with the Moom on your underarm, use the wash cloth as stated previously with  warm/hot water to wipe away the Moom, then use a paper towel to pat the area dry.</li>
            <li> If for example you have made a mistake with the Moom on your underarm, use the wash cloth as stated previously with  warm/hot water to wipe away the Moom, then use a paper towel to pat the area dry.</li>
            <li> This, along with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t remove hair quite as well as hot wax does, made this product a big disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and it was painful, it didn&#x27;t remove hair completely, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> After MOOMing, I washed the area again with COLD water (to close those infection-prone pores) and the same mild soap, dried the area, and applied the home-made Tend Skin solution</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that it is much easier, faster, and less expensive to just buy lighter fluid and a Bic lighter and be done with it.</li>
            <li> The substance is weird, dry fast but not really sticky.</li>
            <li> a very very very paper thin layer of the wax should be used (that&#x27;s all you need!).</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little more difficult to spread on your skin because it is NOT warm wax.  </li>
            <li> reapplied Moom to the neck/chin area several time, but very little hair was removed.  </li>
            <li> It is also slightly less painful than using wax, but I had more redness and irritation with the Moom than I did with the wax.  </li>
            <li> But reading the reviews I saw many people said that Moom was less painful than wax--and indeed that was the case for me.</li>
            <li> And I did not get purple marks from burst blood vessels which happened with all the other methods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly where things went wrong, but I ended up with some bruising, bleeding from the hair follicles, and to add insult to injury, it only removed 3/4 of the hair, so I had to pluck the strays.</li>
            <li> I had only a small amount of pinkness and no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> other waxes</li>
            <li> Moom, on the other hand, removed almost everything.</li>
            <li> I assumed by other reviews that this would probably work for me.</li>
            <li> I am an ordinary person, with normal hair ( not to coarse or thin )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will be taking on the task of leg waxing quite yet, but I will definitely be doing my arms again as well as bikini and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Extremely affordable AND</li>
            <li> I now prep by washing my face, drying entirely, then smoothing on an extremely small amount of baby powder or cornstarch.  </li>
            <li> When I use the other wax, I don&#x27;t need to reheat it</li>
            <li> This product is extremely inefficient, in fact, it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I was amazed - there was no skin pain, just the slightly sharp sensation of hairs being pulled from their roots.</li>
            <li> Just to share awareness that although the product description reads \\&quot;diminishes the pain and eliminates the discomfort of waxing and other</li>
            <li> I did small patches at time, also trying to let areas rest a bit before going back over them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried shaving, using depilatories, and other wax products, and none of them compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I wish I just started with this because it would have saved me money if I didn&#x27;t have to experiment with the other</li>
            <li> On a relative scale, tweezing, getting your blood drawn, pulling a Band-Aid off your arm, and those horrible Sally Hansen wax strips definitely hurt more than this.  </li>
            <li> With other waxing products, they tell you that you can&#x27;t re wax what you have already done and to just tweeze what you missed.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but with practice you can get pretty close</li>
            <li> I bought this product being a bit skeptical of whether it would actually work--but was pleasantly surprised when it removed arm and bikini area hair as well as wax!</li>
            <li> it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> , it was my first time MOOMing a rather difficult area.</li>
            <li> Do small areas, not big areas.  </li>
            <li> Not compared to some of the other wax is that I have used.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this was due to exposure to the air.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxing</li>
            <li> and i won&#x27;t buy any other product for hair removal (:</li>
            <li> Absolutely not recommended !</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions from the package and all the miscellaneous suggestions from other reviewers and nothing I do works.  </li>
            <li> The product works reasonably well for thick hair, but for the thin hairs around my eyebrows and upper lip it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> I have yet to wax any part other than from my knee to ankles, fyi.    </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when first purchasing this product, But.</li>
            <li> I usually just use Sally Hansen hair remover cream for my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Every other hair remover I&#x27;ve tried made my skin break out in a rash</li>
            <li> Also, when I wash the wax off the cotton sheet that is used for hair removal, the wax comes off easier than the other products.</li>
            <li> I followed one other user&#x27;s recommendation and put the stuff on the strip, then applied it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any hair removal method other than shaving.</li>
            <li> am looking forward to trying this on other body parts</li>
            <li> Other types of waxing make my face break out, but not this one.</li>
            <li> (No, really, I did!)  </li>
            <li> -When using a stick to take out the wax, use wet fingers to cut the dripping goo!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to exfoliate your skin where you waxed when the hair is about to start coming back in because the skin will grow over the open hair pores and will trap the new growth underneath it and cause really painful, ugly ingrown hairs.</li>

            <li> For other women with very thick hair on their legs... I did have to wax a couple times in the same area to remove all hair, and with practice I realized that the smaller amount of hair</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;d recommend caution on your eyebrows-practice using it for a while then do the eyebrows very carefully)</li>
            <li> The pain was quite tolerable for me, in the most sensitive areas it was perhaps a 3 or 4 in the pain scale where 10 is the worst.</li>
            <li> After trying it, I can honestly say that this is the least painful product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to try it a few more times but got frustrated at the attempt.</li>
            <li> Spread it pretty thinly at room temperature onto a small strip of cloth, leaving some room to hold on.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> But recently, I noticed some thin hair growing over my upper lip, and I decided to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> said, rubbed the cloth strip rapidly over the wax, pulled my skin taught, and holy cow.</li>
            <li> I felt sorry for my daughter who was getting sores from using soft wax (Honey Wax) to remove the fuzz from her upper lips, so I did some research and ordered Moom organic Tea Tree and Lavender hair removal kits.</li>
            <li> Really, I assumed it with the scrapes/cuts (I&#x27;m not that dumb!)</li>
            <li> My hairs are very soft and thin.  </li>
            <li> I bought a single package with a 6 oz jar of Moom, 12 body and 6 face washable fabric strips, plus a few applicators for under $15(US).  </li>
            <li> With regular wax it would be very painful to try to remove the hair twice from the same spot, but with Moom you can clean up and do it again until you remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The reviews I read about this product were so overwhelmingly positive that I was skeptical-</li>
            <li> I also read over repetitive use there will be less hair growing back.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I have very pale skin and dark hairs on my upper lip.     </li>
            <li> Strips are very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very difficult to clean up.</li>
            <li> With other waxes the area would stay red for a couple of hours and usually I would have a few zits develop in the area after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less painful than waxing, and the stuff washes off so easily.</li>
            <li> My skin typically gets irritated by other waxes and products and with this, no redness, no bumps, no itching, no burning.</li>
            <li> but this product failed in removing hair, which is it&#x27;s main purpose! :</li>
            <li> I always used the hard blocks of zip wax because it was the only stuff that worked.</li>
            <li> I have the Gigi kit, and used the hard wax and also a blue one.</li>
            <li> - if you try hard enough it will not drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but more tired of spending 20$ at a time for waxing my armpit.</li>
            <li> not sure why, but the little that was left did not get thick enough to rip out any hairs at all.  </li>
            <li> Where this is not pain free it is much less painful than other waxes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Another important difference is that removing hair with this product is less painful than using the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike wax, which you have to heat an be very careful where you put it on your body, Moom can be used unheated or just slightly heated and you can rinse or soak in water if you applied it somewhere</li>
            <li> A huge rash from irritation has formed on my chest and just wearing a shirt today is painful</li>
            <li> I have really delicate skin and followed tips I read online about taking a pain reliever an hour before sugaring, using baby powder to create a barrier between the skin and sugar so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and then following up the sugaring with an aloe-based gel or lotion.</li>
            <li> Silly me, I really thought I could do this alone.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair....</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions they gave me and it was pretty simple and not too painful.</li>
            <li> I waxed for at least 30 minutes after the initial 15min</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll last me at least 6 months or a year.</li>
            <li> ; - 1/2&amp;#34; long otherwise lots of hairs will get left behind.  </li>
            <li> Its not worth.</li>
            <li> My pubic hair is coarser than average, like the rest of the hair on my body.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and hassel.</li>
            <li> You have to hair at least a quarter inch in length, according to their directions for it to properly work.</li>
            <li> not worth it...</li>
            <li> and I might be thick, but my legs are NOT that big.</li>
            <li> Read all of the instructions carefully and literally... waste of time.</li>
            <li> It is completely ineffective on finer hair on my legs or face, which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> when I heated it up, it constantly went on way too thick and cooled faster than I could even spread it around.</li>
            <li> This was horrible and I know now that I shouldn&#x27;t trust all the good reviews I read on here.</li>
            <li> If I microwave it only 10 seconds, the texture is too thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark, thick and kinda coarse.</li>
            <li> But I was getting really tired of spending $50 every month to get waxed professionally</li>
            <li> I am a brunette and have thick dark hair that grows back visibly the day after shaving.</li>
            <li> When I tried it out it had the complete opposite effect, this does not remove the hair very well and is VERY PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper,more comfortable and certainly less painful than being waxed at a salon.</li>
            <li> The strips are cleanable and the stuff breaks down with water, so</li>
            <li> By the second-third application I got the technique down.</li>
            <li> once you get the technique down.</li>
            <li> I dont have this problem if i use other wax products!</li>
            <li> (Other waxes cause me to react for days!)</li>
            <li> The slight mess/pain I saved with Moom was just not worth it...</li>
            <li> If i had dark hair, i might give it less stars.</li>
            <li> (from a half an hour down to 15 minutes)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other brands of hair waxing etc</li>
            <li> Once you put it on your skin it gums up and only covers a very small area.</li>
            <li> Other brands of wax would leave a few hair strands, which I would have to get rid by plucking or shaving after I am done waxing.</li>
            <li> For the past few months I would start off by trimming the hair and then letting it grow back for a few days.</li>
            <li> A few things that I would like to tell other people wanting to try it, when the directions say &#x27;10 seconds or until honey like texture&#x27;</li>
            <li> Washes off completely with water (no more sticky mess!!!).</li>
            <li> It takes off the hairs but very thin or not long enough stays, so it worked for me just 70%.</li>
            <li> I find jar wax very annoying to use because its very messy and doesn&#x27;t stay warm during the entire waxing process.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is not too bad, either, since this is a water-based product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to put any sort of lotions on afterwards either; I just wash off and after half a day the reddness is gone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black hair on my face</li>
            <li> It hurts less.</li>
            <li> I had some slight bleeding/scabbing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t burn yourself on the MOOM, which seems to get hotter than wax with less time in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Less heat, strips, and</li>
            <li> - removes about half of the hair, and often just breaks it</li>
            <li> The instructions don&#x27;t clarify this, but I found that a swift peel resulted in cleaner results and less pain than just trying to rip the strip off.  </li>
            <li> Remember as you use the Moom less will be in the jar, so the less Moom in the jar, the shorter the warming time.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but I&#x27;m hugely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would give this less stars</li>
            <li> *Pain: When it comes to ripping your hair out, stinging is what I typically expect.  </li>
            <li> It works AND it hurts WAY less than waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that there only seems to be enough strips of fabric to do one leg before washing them.</li>
            <li> After one leg, half the jar is gone but it&#x27;s still a bargain compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li> Way less discomfort than plucking</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that using Moom on my bikini line hurt less than waxing my eyebrows!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was willing to give this a try even if it was just as painful as waxing, because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try sugar wax for a long time, and Moom was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> tried 20 strips with slight results and decided to wait for hair to grow longer</li>
            <li> slight results.  </li>
            <li> Less pain than wax</li>
            <li> Plus, the hairs that grow in now, pull out easier and with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pain was not a problem there, it just seemed to remove less hairs, a lot less.</li>
            <li> i like this product because everytime you use it you grow less hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about 30 seconds or less in my microwave to heat.  </li>
            <li> i noticed that i causes redness vs nads which was much less    to me</li>
            <li> Waxing hurt a lot less with this product than with others.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs and upper lip is really thin and not very noticeable</li>
            <li> After going over an area half a freaking dozen times, I gave up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Roughly 20% of the hair on the test portion of my chest was left behind after one strip</li>
            <li> you need a LOT less product than you think.</li>
            <li> I had to heat it up in the microwave just slightly</li>
            <li> Less hair is removed if you have a ton of this stuff on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half way through the 12oz bottle my strips were moldy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, a little painful though, but comparing to wax (which I hated after the first use)</li>
            <li> All you other Italian girls out there will know what I mean when I say that I got really tired of getting my upper lip and brows waxed every 10 days or so.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and it almost seems like it&#x27;s not strong enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Simple wash, also works well, but the witch hazel I found to be less painful to get rid of the extra left overs off the skin quicker.</li>
            <li> Simple wash, also works well, but the witch hazel I found to be less painful to get rid of the extra left overs off the skin quicker.</li>
            <li> The pain and mess were certainly not worth the few hairs that it managed to pull out.</li>
            <li> The stuff was a mess and didn&#x27;t want to spread.  </li>
            <li> I used another wax product from Sally Hansen and returned it because of the sticky mess it made everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you get the MOOM mixture too hot, it hurts, but if it is too cold, it won&#x27;t spread.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I did everything the instructions said and just ended up with a mess of wax on myself.  </li>
            <li> The first try was crazy as you would expect.  </li>
            <li> a lotttt of pain and a lot of sticky mess</li>
            <li> And if you mess up the application you can just wash it off and reapply.</li>
            <li> Then comes the mess and the spills.</li>
            <li> The few hairs I did see before were on the strip and the dark area, I saw nothing on the strip but no darkness on my face any longer either.  </li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t make a mess at all.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you try to spread it as thin as possible, and don&#x27;t worry, the wax is extremely sticky.</li>
            <li> The jar is small, but if you&#x27;re using a thin layer as directed, I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> then a little less.  </li>
            <li> If you are someone who hates to read manuals, follow directions, submit to a little bit of pain from pulling hair directly from the root out of your face, or overall wants the removal of hair from your face to be done in like 2 minutes (this takes time people, putting a small amount of Moom on each area and pulling off takes timeeee!!!!!!!!)</li>
            <li> Then immediately put the strip on, firmly press down in the direction of hair growth a couple</li>
            <li> I tried to position my leg to keep the skin as tight as I could and then didn&#x27;t need to try to use my hand to keep it taught except for a couple of places, but I didn&#x27;t make the skin taught there and thus received a bit of mottled bruising.</li>
            <li> because even though I thought I put the lid on tight, it still attracted a hord of ants.</li>
            <li> Money is getting tight</li>
            <li> I previously tried a roll on wax which was messy</li>
            <li> as even when slightly heated it gets too sticky and cannot grab the hair as firmly.</li>
            <li> So for bikini line, I&#x27;ll spread a thin layer on the cloth, that is long and somewhat wide.</li>
            <li> youre looking to wax, I would suggest using the pre-MOOM strips because they would be less messy.</li>
            <li> One of the women suggested Moom instead; cheaper and less messy.</li>
            <li> Fairly heavy black hair.</li>
            <li> but this by far is much easier and less painful!  </li>
            <li> What a mess and waste of time.  </li>
            <li> I mention again the blood thinners cause me to bruise when the wind blows, however I found that I had little bruising.</li>
            <li> sometimes you&#x27;ll get a little strip of hair that got the wax on it but wasn&#x27;t pulled out.</li>
            <li> A little info about me...</li>
            <li> You may have to be a little force with a spill.  </li>
            <li> You may have to be a little force with a spill.  </li>
            <li> As with any wax there&#x27;s a little sting</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll buy a men&#x27;s refill and see if it goes on a little smoother</li>
            <li> Rubbing on a little baby powder before applying can help.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a little pinch</li>
            <li> reason for the four stars is that I guess because of all my shaving my legs were a little brown and it looked to me like after moom-ing</li>
            <li> little redness occurred during the process but that went away within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy wax</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but nothing like wax.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried from comments where people were complaining..</li>
            <li> so I started doing a little searching and found Moom.</li>
            <li> The trick is it takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not wax so it just needs to be warmed a little to soften up.</li>
            <li> it removed little to no hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had trouble with was that majority of the moon wax didn&#x27;t grab my hair follicles, and I had to reapply numerous times; I&#x27;m not sure if I was doing the process wrong</li>
            <li> A little messy and took a little bit to do it correctly, but this product works great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Less mess and gentler on the skin!  </li>
            <li> It is a little messy until you get used to it, I did heat it up in the microwave to get it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair, it pulls a few little hairs out with each pull.</li>
            <li> I took a little blob of wax and just dabbed it over the hairs, then I put the strip on the wax and just DABBED IT (not smooth it out in direction of hair growth, even though that&#x27;s what the directions say).</li>
            <li> a little messy</li>
            <li> For a few hours afterwards I did feel a little irritation, but it was gone by afternoon.  </li>
            <li> To remove the hairs, I focus on a small area at a time (maybe half an inch by half an inch).</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The only way to even get it to almost work is when it&#x27;s hard at least from my experience.</li>
            <li> A bit painful but waxing is far more painful.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.......</li>
            <li> Complete fail.</li>
            <li> Messy, and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but this product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> but I thought I had wasted my money when I used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sooo much trouble being a hirstute woman.</li>
            <li> and it did have some trouble with the semi-recently shaved stuff.</li>
            <li> but I have to do it a few times.</li>
            <li> It also lasts forever--you only need a thin layer for it to work.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to allow a few days for waxingif you&#x27;re doing it yourself and you&#x27;ve never done it before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pluck strays with tweezers if you missed a few</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste wax on</li>
            <li> Pluck strays with tweezers if you missed a few</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste wax on</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I also tried the Nads line of sugar based waxes.</li>
            <li> no hair left behind AT ALL.      </li>
            <li> So, here are a few possibilities why it didn&#x27;t work for me:  1)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people had so much trouble with it?</li>
            <li> a few refills, at $9</li>
            <li> a few stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few seconds and then rip off the strip</li>
            <li> I watched a few youtube videos and tried it on myself (underarms and brazilian) - and it does the job</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to waste</li>
            <li> But boy was this stuff messy.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of doing it,I just had a few hairs here and there popping up.</li>
            <li> It is messy and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was WAY too messy and it didn&#x27;t even take any hair off anyway.</li>
            <li> Product is messy.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a messy jar</li>
            <li> Before I applied it I WASHED AND DRIED</li>
            <li> even pressing firmly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a waste of money and effort</li>
            <li> I gave the MOOM hair removal kit four stars just because it was rather messy and took about 2 hours-</li>
            <li> - i&#x27;d rather do this once or twice a month vs shaving every few days.  </li>
            <li> aits messy, so I</li>
            <li> As soon as i heated it and start putting on my legs it was so messy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Can be messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few at home waxing kits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed before, and I was impatient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to have my legs waxed professionally for over a year now and its getting a bit expensive for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too messy and cleans up</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but here are a few tips:    </li>
            <li> I tested it out on my arms a few April 5 and as of today, April 17, my arms are still hairless.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you&#x27;re supposed to soak them in water and</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few time on my legs and arms and no hair was removed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 100% water soluble, so you can wash and re-use the strips and also get it off of your face/hands without any trouble.</li>
            <li> , I received the Moom, reread the directions a few times, and went for it.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it will be messy</li>
            <li> But I wasted some because of my lack of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, you are unable to return.</li>
            <li> Also, it was messy.</li>
            <li> it is messy, sticky, I tried everything like the box said, I google it, and still wouln&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I warmed the wax for a short time in the micro wave and spread it on thinly.  </li>
            <li> Can be a bit messy though.</li>
            <li> And still, it leaves behind 25%-50% of the hair on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hesitate for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I was simply tired of shaving constantly.</li>
            <li> I tried several times and just was not happy.</li>
            <li> It is also sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> IT CAN GET MESSY</li>
            <li> And always have some moisturizer on hand afterwards to apply to the spots where hair was removed, it will be tender and might get dried out.</li>
            <li> the product didn&#x27;t work waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I had to re-do 1 spot a few times.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I had shingles a few years ago on the left side on my face.</li>
            <li> For the past 10+ years I have gone to get my eyebrows waxed about 1-2 times per month, but was looking for something to help cut down on that expense.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with waxes or creams or any of those hair removal products other than those for shaving, and I tend to be clumsy and messy with this sort of thing, so I was a little worried about using Moom.  </li>
            <li> (They want HALF an inch of hair!)  </li>
            <li> Store brands were somewhat painful and extremely hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try on my bikini area as I have tried other products and was not happy, but not ready to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> It was pretty rough to endure; the upper lip was the worst!  </li>
            <li> and I can see where this would beat other common brands.</li>
            <li> I like that idea because the cloths, while washable, are a bit stiff after hand washing and somewhat of a pain to keep washing them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a couple of tries to apply the wax correctly and for it to adhere to the hairs, but it was far less painful than I had</li>
            <li> I wanted to tame and it serves me well.</li>
            <li> but now I can go a little longer without waxing (sometimes a week and a half since my hair has been growing slowly now).</li>
            <li> i mean after you use the strip..no other product has to be applied to kill the pain..</li>
            <li> and i had to do it 2-3 times to get all of it out which was pretty painful.</li>
            <li> The first was with a drugstore brand and was disastrous.</li>
            <li> Probably not ideal for coarse hair types.</li>
            <li> Also, apply it in small areas (e.g. 1 by 1.5 inches) because it&#x27;s easier to rip out a few hairs at a time than a million hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> I looked at cloth and there were a few small hairs on it</li>
            <li> The product did not completely remove the hair in one and even two applications which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> It just does not grip thick dark hairs.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this product might be too messy, and not strong enough for me, but was wrong on both counts.  </li>
            <li> The cloth strip took all the product off with it as well, so there was virtually no clean up!</li>
            <li> I have some tough facial fur and was introduced to waxing quite late in life.  </li>
            <li> When I use wax, my skin gets angry red and it hurts for a few days.</li>
            <li> It does tend to miss some minor clumps and if you are not careful can be extremely painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Cut the strips into smaller pieces if they are not grabbing enough hair or if you find it to be too painful.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and black.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and bought this kit to wax my stomach, because I hate the hair growth I get from the increase in hormones.</li>
            <li> Yay little hairs came off!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a single hair behind.</li>
            <li> I only got a few hairs off and red skin:(</li>
            <li> It much less painful than normal waxing  2)</li>
            <li> I have very little hair in my stomach and a some hair in the chest area...</li>
            <li> This product removes hair without damaging skin and very little pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at varying temperatures, but this product removes very little hair.  </li>
            <li> Messy and hard to deal with.  </li>
            <li> but it really wasnt too bad.</li>
            <li> It was painful for my underarm since the hair was much thicker.</li>
            <li> It was messy and not effective at all.</li>
            <li> It usually takes 20 seconds in my microwave to heat it up.</li>
            <li> I decided to give sugaring another chance, because I knew I was doing something wrong, the hair that was removed took 3 weeks to grow back, and once the bruising went away  </li>
            <li> Not sure i will buy again.</li>
            <li> The strips they provide are so small, it would take 100 of them to wax 1 leg.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunatley I contacted   Amazon a day past the return allowance.</li>
            <li> I usually stay that way for about two weeks even though the packaging says longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wax, but when I got fed up with shaving every couple of days, I tried Moom&#x27;s sugar-based hair remover.</li>
            <li> Unbeknownst to me, it would have been wiser to use the small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time friends!</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am not sure if this product is just for women, hehehehe</li>
            <li> for the past couple of years, and wasted a lot of time (and pain and skin!)</li>
            <li> I dabbed the product on my skin, smoothed it out with the small spreading stick, and adhered the small cloth.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and was anxious to try it on my arms.</li>
            <li> I usually wax and</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is my lack of experience or the product.  </li>
            <li> No more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> but once again I couldn&#x27;t get past 2 pulls before I quit.</li>
            <li> I am also planning on not touching the area at all, as I know this can contribute to pimples.  </li>
            <li> When your close-up vision is going you don&#x27;t want to be spreading heavy wax around your eyes!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I usually microwave this product in increments of 10 seconds until it has a honey-like consistency.</li>
            <li> Not only is it cheap..took me 3 minutes to do my eyebrows and that&#x27;s with sadly 2 months of overgrow  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> had electrolysis in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used Moom on my bikini line and armpits, and after using anti-bump pads and lotion, I am shockingly bump free!</li>
            <li> I just get this weird fix from ripping hair out of my face after subjecting myself to having facial waxing at a nail shop.  </li>
            <li> We all know how difficult it is to remove wax residue from the tender red waxed areas on our face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I want to order another one.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I have been paying a salon $57 every 4 weeks to have my bikini area</li>
            <li> I usually use one but since they didnt</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions so not sure what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> , my skin reacted weird to it--little red bumpss</li>
            <li> but the quantity is small for the price.</li>
            <li> , only gave it 4 stars because the description was slightly wrong.</li>
            <li> I put the wax, in the water in front of a small heater.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately cant get my money back.</li>
            <li> I use this for my bikini line but did use it once on my legs when I was unable to go for a regular waxing.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many of the heat up waxes with the cloths and they were awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would work, because, if it did, everyone would be raving about it.  </li>
            <li> No, no more Moom for me.</li>
            <li> usually the hair starts growing the day after shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was because I couldn&#x27;t handle the pain</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with the product...won&#x27;t be repurchasing Moom again.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought this and gave it a try this past Friday.  </li>
            <li> Just one time getting them waxed cost me around $12 ($25 if you go to a &#x27;salon - I usually just pop into the nail places in the mall,</li>
            <li> I use it on my underarms, I have thickness hair that I usually get waxed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want to switch to Moom for my legs yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to home wax with a wax-based product, because I&#x27;d be worried I&#x27;d ruin my linens.</li>
            <li> and I usually breakout after waxing..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was my technique or the wax itself but thought I would mention it.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s positive reviews, but it was the least painful waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I found that it removed the hair as well or betterthan last time, and it felt slightly gentler and less painful this way.  </li>
            <li> This is less painful and no mess at all.</li>
            <li> skin problem aside, the product is very messy.</li>
            <li> it can be very messy.</li>
            <li> When you apply the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; (spreading in the direction of the hair growth) you want to end up with a very thin layer left on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a brazilian in less than 30 mins!!</li>
            <li> I find this really frustrating given my experience and the other reviews, so</li>
            <li> Wow, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> This one is sooo much less painful, especially once you get the hang of it and done it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very good at removing hair.</li>
            <li> No more picking hard bits of wax connected to hair off your body...</li>
            <li> This stuff was a MESS!!</li>
            <li> small patches around thick hair, unless of course you like excruciating pain.  </li>
            <li> I do have a high pain tolerance, but this is the least painful wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash!</li>
            <li> have used traditional waxing and SUGAR waxing is way less painful</li>
            <li> As you use it it might become hard again, just give it another 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look in to hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look in to hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to spread</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moving on to hard wax now</li>
            <li> (i have a hard time believing that anyone does)</li>
            <li> that I got from a Sally Hansen hard wax kit, it tool FOREVER to heat up.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried on legs-but can&#x27;t be as hard as lips and chin.</li>
            <li> Anywho, it didn&#x27;t take hardly any hair off.</li>
            <li> and I do a lot of outdoor hiking/backpacking/etc where it may be hard to shave my legs for days.</li>
            <li> and I had to scrub really hard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be so hard to heat up, and once heated it was hard to manage putting it on the skin.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it does hurt I mean of course its going to you&#x27;re ripping your hair out but not as bad as it could be</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and did not work, do not waste your money really bad product.</li>
            <li> The only thing they say that i found didnt work was using the wax cold.</li>
            <li> But in my case my hair starts to grow within 2 weeks, but on product it was written that at least for 2 months there will be no hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen wax products (which btw stand up to their NEGATIVE reviews...)</li>
            <li> &quot; I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had imagined.</li>
            <li> Laser hair removal has piqued my interest as of late, but that is another can of worms altogether...</li>
            <li> I would recommend growing the underarm hair to at least 1/2 inch before attempting underarms.  </li>
            <li> Painful removal like any wax, but my skin (which is sensitive) recovered well with it.</li>
            <li> It least that works.</li>
            <li> Wax is stronger so may be preferred for some hair types or at least some stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> I did read some of the negative reviews but decided that I wanted to try MOOM.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products.</li>
            <li> but think that may be where a lot of the negative reviews come from.</li>
            <li> The spreader they give sucks.</li>
            <li> Not effective</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting up my cloth strips into smaller pieces and using them that way.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work so well for hair that wasn&#x27;t thick, like my leg hair.</li>
            <li> The fabric was pulling away slowly, and had strands of the wax pulling while I winced.</li>
            <li> If you put it on too thick, it&#x27;s not going to work.  </li>
            <li> I may be applying too thick so could be my fault.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely thick at room temperature and broke the sticks provided during application.  </li>
            <li> the wax is too thick it won&#x27;t grab the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I feel slow</li>
            <li> Heat the wax to a thick syrup like consistency -</li>
            <li> I spread it on too thick.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need a salon treatment for that, or just shave it until it gets thick and then use the Moom :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is messy, way worse than wax, and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it goes on thick</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve forgotten a few times with frustrating results).</li>
            <li> I normally use the hard wax that you have to microwave, and not only is it messy, but extremely painful, difficult to manage, and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> It was so less painful than waxing (Brazilian) and a lot less messy because it cleans up neatly with water.</li>
            <li> Regular wax has some serious horror stories that go along with it, and I didn&#x27;t want to risk one of the awkward situations I keep reading about.</li>
            <li> Wax is messy, but not with moom!!</li>
            <li> I mean, how could that be?</li>
            <li> I mean, you will still get pain, but it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
            <li> Shaving is a thing of the past after discovering this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if any of the product would hurt him, but I don&#x27;t want to find out!</li>
            <li> Unlike other waxes that harden and become really difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that it&#x27;s expensive for its size!</li>
            <li> No more shaving for me!</li>
            <li> It removes hair efficiently and can be washed off with water, no more sticky wax~~!</li>
            <li> It is messy, requires a lot of materials, takes a long time, is fairly painful, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In years past, I&#x27;ve tried various other home hair-removal methods:  an epilator (too painful), a Gigi brand home waxing kit (also too painful and very messy), and Veet and Nair (but have disliked using chemical products in my nether regions).  </li>
            <li> No where near as painful as hard wax!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse hair and was doubtful that mere sugar and lemon juice could actually work, but it did!  </li>
            <li> Use a thin layer, like the instructions state, and apply in the direction of the hair growth in small sections and viola - hair gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at eyebrows, and I usually get them waxed but the place I go to is is 1.5 hours roundtrip plus the wait time and waxing time.  </li>
            <li> , where very small spots of blood appeared where the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> and it is very painful to remove the hair on the soft part of the \\&quot;little girl\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seriously, this company needs to fire whoever did testing on effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Seriously Moom,  where have you been all my life?</li>
            <li> Seriously, read the ingredients list on this.</li>
            <li> and it was the most painful (and bloody) experience of my life.</li>
            <li> And my leghair grows fast, and when it brushes against the cloth of hiking pants it is soooo annoying and irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at home hard waxing kits, it painful, messy and not worth trying again.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t so bad on my back - small patches of thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to hurt myself or make a mess or just spend money on something useless.</li>
            <li> I previously tried Surgi-wax Brazilian hard waxing kit, and it was an extremely painful and messy experience.  </li>
            <li> Other wax-at-home kits that I&#x27;ve tried, have proven to be messy, painful, and still not getting me the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about self hair removal.</li>
            <li> When I had finished he had little spots of blood from where the hairs had been torn out, and for 2 days after he had a weird bumpy rash.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this but gave it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> Tired the hard wax at home.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a chemical hair remover on my face and it always irritated my skin, but recently I suffered a bad chemical burn.</li>
            <li> But I just needed to try it because of bad recent experiences with drugstore kits.</li>
            <li> When it finally came time to test the product out, I was shock on how bad it sucked.</li>
            <li> I tried Moom&#x27;s sugar wax after a bad experience with regular waxing.</li>
            <li> I was looking into buying Nad&#x27;s, but only read bad reviews.</li>
            <li> those areas... is not a good idea because it causes sweat, which defeats the stickiness of the product.</li>
            <li> not a good product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to get my eyebrows waxed at a salon and hated how much it hurt and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll just be a gross painful</li>
            <li> I also tried my bikini line not as painful as imagine since last time</li>
            <li> but it was worth the time and effort to not have those horrible ingrowns or bleeding skin from waxing.  </li>
            <li> NO GOOD.  </li>
            <li> product 7 years ago that was some weird slimy green stuff that self adheres to the body, it was rubbish and didn&#x27;t lift a hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it thin, thick, and everywhere in between.  </li>
            <li> They mean paper thin when they say it.</li>
            <li> There were some residual shorter ones left behind, but the long nasty ones were gone.  </li>
            <li> And an added plus, it hardly hurts!</li>
            <li> However, I have had a hard time with the temperature and the texture of the wax!</li>
            <li> The first time i tried it I was very disappointed with the results because ot didn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WARM IT UP!</li>
            <li> , at least I tried it once !</li>
            <li> I was not successful in getting this product to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to work w/.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair removal products and they all seem to be either too messy, too expensive, too painful, too complicated, or too irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> When I called customer service they were very rude and unhelpful.</li>
            <li> So little bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> it was still too tough for me to spread out to a paper thin</li>
            <li> expensive, painful, left with wax</li>
            <li> Tired the Moom</li>
            <li> Also not happy that it doesn&#x27;t work for eyebrow correction (i can&#x27;t imagine waiting till hair on my eye brows</li>
            <li> I was whoa confused.</li>
            <li> I tried applying a thin coat....</li>
            <li> apply a thin coat -</li>
            <li> and you can spread it on really thin.</li>
            <li> Some hairs were broken off as some reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> It was so frustrating</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have course hair and this product will leave hairs behind after you wax an area - a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> either i have thin hairs on my legs</li>
            <li> There seems to be a stubborn blob that refuses to thin out like the rest of the mixture.  </li>
            <li> On my face, Moom picked up shorter hairs my wax had missed or broken off.</li>
            <li> Put on thinly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overheat it though, or it might not stick to the hairs, or worse burn your face.</li>
            <li> , it was easier to apply a PAPER THIN COATING to my face using the applicators provided.</li>
            <li> Keyword: PAPER THIN (read the manual)...</li>
            <li> tip, I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper alternative that didn&#x27;t involve nasty chemicals or too much pain.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m addicted to waxing my legs.</li>
            <li> and I managed to thinly apply the sugar as advised.</li>
            <li> HEY EVERTONE IM TIRED OF SHAVING MY FACE</li>
            <li> w/a product that I absolutely hate, cuz uthis can&#x27;t b sent back.</li>
            <li> I did leave some hair behind on my legs, but they are sparse and not noticeable.</li>
            <li> Spread it thin.</li>
            <li> But I am tired of paying $20.00 for a lip wax.  </li>
            <li> This company does not stand behind their prodect.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a long-time waxer, but i have always hated the mess of the conventional wax.</li>
            <li> Unless I did this wrong, this product almost took half of my face off!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to use this product without getting wax all over your hands and bathroom counter because the wax never hardens -- it&#x27;s just a stringy and sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I think the postiive reviews are fake, this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> It pulled on the hairs and left a nasty, painful, red rash.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to try a product that is less painful.</li>
            <li> : It is less painful than wax.</li>
            <li> Its much less painful than going to a salon</li>
            <li> it was less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> He said getting a tattoo is way less painful.</li>
            <li> It was MUCH less painful than threading and less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was less painful than wax.</li>
            <li> i saw that moom is less painful</li>
            <li> I also found that it was less painful</li>
            <li> know it hurts, and if it truly is less painful than waxing, I could not handle that either.</li>
            <li> I found the Moom to be less painful than wax and wash off easier.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried waxing before with horrible results.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I did, I didn&#x27;t have enough control to keep from nicking myself all over the place and being on blood thinners, it looked like a brutal murder had taken place for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> The pain wasn&#x27;t bad, just a little sting.    </li>
            <li> The product adhered to the hair well, he said it was painful when I spread it on because it pulled at the hair, then each time I pulled off a strip he yelled, jumped around and cursed a little.  </li>
            <li> I bought moom because i dont have a microwave and was having a hard time finding any wax that could be used cold or heated on the stove-top.</li>
            <li> When at room temperature the wax can get a firmer grip of the hair without going all over the place in a messy way ( and hence is not as painful when pulling).&lt;br</li>
            <li> OMG, when I would use those it would hurt so bad I would be crying, bleeding, and traumatized.</li>
            <li> It was painful and didn&#x27;t even remove all of the hair from the few spots I tested on my legs.</li>
            <li> It was messy and painful and did not work all that well.  </li>
            <li> It was a messy and painful process, and I quit halfway through.</li>
            <li> &quot; products they are not worth the money:(</li>
            <li> This stuff is insanely sticky, and I felt completely overwhelmed once I got</li>
            <li> (I had already had a professional Brazilian wax to fix my terrible Surgi-wax experience, so I couldn&#x27;t wax my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I haved waxed snd hated it because it was hot, painful, and always made me break out.</li>
            <li> and I hated having to constantly reheat them.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not actually a very good wax.  </li>
            <li> However like wax, it is very painful to remove hair that was previously only shaved before--which is probably the law of nature :</li>
            <li> I got sick of it, got my walgreens-purchased Sally Hansen messy wax, and finished the job--</li>
            <li> Spread wax thinly - spread the wax very thinly in the direction of hair growth.  </li>
            <li> a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> /c i was tired of getting nasty, painful ingrown hairs on my bikini line and the wax really irritates my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past couple months on my face and it does take away unwanted hair without being too painful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money :(</li>
            <li> and I remember it being very messy and painful.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and its everywhere!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly disappointed in MOOM because it&#x27;s not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Those other products also smelled bad and they were always impossible to remove unless one has those alcohol wipes to wipe the stuff off.</li>
            <li> The strips were useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it does not remove the unwanted hair as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and they distract you by talking to you about random things before ripping the hair out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claim that you can reuse the strips</li>
            <li> but I attribute that to the fact that it was difficult for me to see and determine the pattern of hair growth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband mistakenly threw away those strips</li>
            <li> Sad day.</li>
            <li> i thought i was using it wrong...</li>
            <li> It hurt and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.twice.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped the jar and the jar broke, spilling all the contents</li>
            <li> Reviews are fake    </li>
            <li> Thought it would work as well as NADS, was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work on me at all.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong about both.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t discover this problem while it was still within the guarantee time frame</li>
            <li> The product was difficult to work with and therefore a pain to apply.  </li>
            <li> Salon waxing can be expensive.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is HORRIBLE and does not write back!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I know, weird.  </li>
            <li> just found it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Really lousy stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit with scepticism as I don&#x27;t do pain and never waxed before as I have never braved a salon and assumed it would be too difficult to DIY.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly i have to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i let a licensed cosmetologist do it, thinking i was probably doing it wrong..  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really difficult to use and literally did not remove one hair from my face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product just doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m unfortunately going to have to  continue using those for my face.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical; didn&#x27;t think this &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;reusable strips&amp;#34; product would work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, using this waxing kit will NOT get you salon results</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair texture, because it&#x27;s difficult for me to find hair removal products that work.</li>
            <li> but maybe I was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Waxing is so expensive and shaving all the time is just a pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the coordination God gave a drunken 3 legged blind elephant.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have anything wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> The people giving this stuff rave reviews either have the wimpiest hair on the planet, or they&#x27;re paid to post fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> Read the directions, and was skeptical because it seemed like there was a lot of room for error.</li>
            <li> I think this method can be difficult for those who have never gotten waxed before.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to see to do the backs of legs - you can do it</li>
            <li> All false!</li>
            <li> Even with repeated use, some hair remains, which is very frustrating and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face, stomach, and bikini area just like the directions said by applying a very thin layer, rubbing over the strip, then pulling.</li>
            <li> (basically scrape the stuff off in the direction of the hair growth, leaving a very thin layer).  </li>
            <li> You want there to be a very thin and shiny coat, but not have it globby or streaky.  </li>
            <li> could hardly even tell :(</li>
            <li> This usually chews up my Saturday or Sunday, and I hate that.  </li>
            <li> The little hair that I did get off, was very painful.</li>
            <li> I bought some years ago because I was sick and tired of spending an hour in the bathroom plucking my eyebrows one by one.</li>
            <li> Im always nervous about ppl starring to hard at my face because I think they are looking at all my hairs on my chin and lip!!!</li>
            <li> It makes it especially hard to keep skin taught when you&#x27;re getting stuck to it at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -Don&#x27;t be afraid to reheat.</li>
            <li> Now, my mom saw this at a Marshalls and bought it for me because she knew I was unhappy with what I was using.</li>
            <li> The second time was so painful - so awfully, torturously painful -</li>
            <li> ANYONE who had a problem is crazy.</li>
            <li> So, all these years have trickled by and I have been chicken to try waxing or sugaring.  </li>
            <li> My puppy went crazy trying to lick the remnants off my leg.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing a salon painful and can get expensive.</li>
            <li> you apply it to skin, pls wait until it become cold then pull off from skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of my chin hairs that drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> If you put it on and either don&#x27;t like where you put it or chicken out</li>
            <li> When it was colder/harder it pulled at the hairs and was difficult and painful to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about six months and was afraid to use.  </li>
            <li> again I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> It failed on face(upperlip) and underarm even after trying 3-4 times!</li>
            <li> Verdict - fail!</li>
            <li> Sadly I was a bit disappointed with the products.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way, and to make matters worst it did not even remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat well at all and was very difficult to use/apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, even though I am very skeptical about the hype of products online.  </li>
            <li> If you spilled it, it was very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Others may however not find the application not as impossible as I did.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about waxing because I have had bad experiences with it before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of shaving, have sworn off depilatories (Nair and Veet are EVIL EVIL EVIL to my skin), and am scared of regular wax (microwaveable, pre-waxed strips and the like).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts bad and gives me anxiety no matter what.</li>
            <li> I was unlucky and got a bad batch  3)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad if you overheat it - you can burn yourself.</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad</li>
            <li> I should have known it was going to be bad when I couldn&#x27;t get the seal off because it had stuck to the sugar.</li>
            <li> However this stuff was equally as bad.</li>
            <li> The pain wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> and I have heard HORROR stories about getting waxed and how it hurts soooo bad.</li>
            <li> It was a bad buying decision for me.  </li>
            <li> but i chickened out after it started to rip because it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> still hurt but not as nearly as bad</li>
            <li> Even though it was bad I KEPT saying, go on...finish it.</li>
            <li> Painful and didn&#x27;t get the hair.  </li>
            <li> MOOMing is not painless like the descriptions claim, but pulling hair out using any method is going to be painful.</li>
            <li> I found MOOMing about as painful as waxing.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not that painful.</li>
            <li> the hair did come out and the area was painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> If the wax is painfully pulling at your hairs when you&#x27;re applying it, it&#x27;s because you let the wax get too cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did not.wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> and at times it was painful.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful on my legs at all.</li>
            <li> It was just as painful as waxing</li>
            <li> Worked well for DIY thing, but it&#x27;s extremely painful for me.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me even on course hair and was not so painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painless, but it doesn&#x27;t feel anywhere as painful as waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so painful.</li>
            <li> This was so painful on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> and it was always painful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so sick of stubble and shaving.</li>
            <li> I ended up being disappointed.    </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> and I still HATE it.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and was looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> and I think you should try it before deciding you hate it--</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a wax heater and wax, not this crap.</li>
            <li> and i HATE being pinched/scratched</li>
            <li> i hate this.</li>
            <li> even I decided I&#x27;d instead tweeze my under arms which is a time consuming experience that is also very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Just painfully pulled hair, did not remove anything!</li>
            <li> It painlessly removed the hair, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I hated the rashes from depilatories and hated the troubles of wax.</li>
            <li> I hated this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt very badly at all.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated</li>
            <li> Watch the tutorial, follow the instructions, and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Buy this product, You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> BOY was I WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can just wash it off with water and does not leave any nasty residuals.</li>
            <li> The prodcut was horrible.</li>
            <li> This crap is going in the trash!!</li>
            <li> My skin broke out really horribly, as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li> So, when I tried it today, I was nervous and expecting a horrible foul-up.    </li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Worst product ever</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t terrible for $12.</li>
            <li> It felt horrible!</li>
            <li> Then I watched a couple of tutorials online and realized I was doing it all wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> What a terrible experience!  </li>
            <li> awful!</li>
            <li> awful!</li>
            <li> I also end up with the worst ingrown hairs known to man.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this wax, its easy to apply with the wooden applicators and it works very well with the strips that came along with it, even better than the strips can be reused just but rinsing it under warm water and letting it dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mainly on my legs and worked very well and didn&#x27;t need to wax for almost 2 whole months until the hairs started to grow back, but in much smaller amounts. I used this on my husband&#x27;s chest and pulled out most of his hair, but I know the fault of it was because they were too long and curly to pull out all at once, but once again its growing back slowly and for him, it beats the chore of shaving/trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out but plan to order just more of the wax. Thank you Moom!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Rachael Ray&#x27;s talk show and thought I would try this organic kit instead of the wax ones.  This barely hurts and the organic stuff actually smells nice!  Really - it smells like sweet honey!  After you&#x27;re done, you just rinse the strips in hot water and lay them out to dry for next time.  Eco-friendly and works great!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t all that great.. It got some hairs, but tons that were missed, and the ones that they did get, some hairs were cut off so there were stubbles... Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product at all, I will admit it was the first time I have use this kind of method. It was messy and not effective at all. I will stick with a razor from now on. The little hair that I did get off, was very painful. It was a waste of my money.......</li>
            <li> What a mess and waste of time.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and this is a joke.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Strips are very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective!  Just be careful because it heats up quite fast in the microwave and you have to be careful not to burn yourself.  Read the instructions.</li>
            <li> Complete fail. I nuked it according to instructions and still too hot. After letting it cool, it just made my hair sticky - think lollipop and would not come off on the strip. The strips were useless. I wasted my money and had to get my hair waxed off by a professional.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions on heating - substance is sticky but works well and quickly.  Really like that fabric strips are reusable.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what exactly this was. It really is a sugar wax, similar to what Middle Eastern women have used for centuries: since 1900 BC, Wikipedia says! There are recipes on how to make this stuff all over the Web; however, I&#x27;m thrilled with buying Moom instead of making my own sugar wax, even though I am usually a DIY-er. This kit is so professional: everything is neat and tidy, no mess for me, stores neatly, beautifully packaged, and enough sugar wax and strips to last me for years. And it works effectively, with very little mess or pain, just as other reviewers have stated. Everyone who&#x27;s not already a pro at making sugar waxes would be well-justified in buying this kit one time for many happy hairless years!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bikini wax.  I&#x27;ve had it done professionally (expensive, painful, left with wax stuck to my skin and areas missed).  Tired the hard wax at home.  HORRIBLE. Painful and didn&#x27;t get the hair.  Tried the Surgi strips.  Not bad but still didn&#x27;t get all the hair and left wax on my skin that was NOT coming off.  Tired the Moom and it is amazing.  Apply it very, very thin in the direction of the hair growth, lightly rub down on the muslin strips then give it a good, continuous yank.  Not as painful as the other stuff I tried and so much more effective. And I did not get purple marks from burst blood vessels which happened with all the other methods. And the redness went away amazingly fast.  Not messy.  Cleans up with warm water.  I really don&#x27;t like reusing the strips, which you can because they clean up easily with warm water, but it grosses me out.  So I bought a roll of muslin waxing strip and cut it to size.  When you&#x27;re done waxing I screw the lid on nice and tight and rinse any wax on the bottle off.  If the bottle sticks shut for the next use, run it under hot water and it softens the sugar. It usually takes 20 seconds in my microwave to heat it up. As you use it it might become hard again, just give it another 10 seconds.  This is so easy and effective I think I&#x27;ll start waxing my legs too. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am very fair skinned, I bruise very easily, and I have very thick dark hair. I am unable to use hot wax for hair removal due to extremely sensitive skin, which I found out the hard way after getting waxed (with what the woman said was for sensitive skin). I have been plucking, shaving, and bleaching to remove or lighten various unwanted hair. Those methods are fine for most areas, but far from ideal for for others. I used to dread swimsuit season for obvious reasons, so when I came across Moom I decided to give it a go after some research. I read all the instructions thoroughly before my 1st use... I&#x27;m not sure exactly where things went wrong, but I ended up with some bruising, bleeding from the hair follicles, and to add insult to injury, it only removed 3/4 of the hair, so I had to pluck the strays. It did hurt, but anything that rips your hair out at the root is going to hurt to some degree. Despite the bruising and bleeding, it honestly wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected... I should note that if I accidentally pluck a hair that is too far into my eyebrows I bleed as well, and hot wax made my eyebrows red and swollen for a week.     I decided to give sugaring another chance, because I knew I was doing something wrong, the hair that was removed took 3 weeks to grow back, and once the bruising went away  a couple of days later there weren&#x27;t any ingrown hairs. The 2nd time around I watched several you tube videos, and decided to try the traditional flicking technique instead of the applicator and strips. The results were about the same, only more messy. It took about 4 weeks for the hair to grow back, but this time I noticed it grew back finer.     My first 2 attempts were definitely user error, and apparently hair that had been previously shaved is extremely stubborn. 3rd time is a charm, right? I watched the Moom video on you tube, and used the technique that Moom outlines in the instructions, and in the video. I can&#x27;t stress enoughthat when applying the sugar, the sugar absolutely must be proper consistency, paper thin, and in the correct direction, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t grab the hair properly. My persistence paid off... 3rd time IS a charm... NO bruising, and NO hair! There was still some bleeding from some follicles, but only in the spots that I had missed previously. I expect there won&#x27;t be bleeding next time around if the trend is consistent.     Verdict:  I gave Moom only 4 stars because the learning curve is a little painful, and I feel the instructions could be a bit better, but the video was definitely helpful. I highly recommend watching it before you start. I also feel that they should have included plastic applicators instead of wooden tongue depressors. I really like that it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not as harsh as hot wax. I can simply wash it off with water if I accidentally get some on a spot that I didn&#x27;t intend to, and I need only wash the muslin strips and they are ready to reuse for the next use. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product, and the results.</li>
            <li> Well, not too exited. It takes off the hairs but very thin or not long enough stays, so it worked for me just 70%. Also not happy that it doesn&#x27;t work for eyebrow correction (i can&#x27;t imagine waiting till hair on my eye brows grows 0,5cm long before i can wax it off eewww)&lt;br /&gt;It worked on bikini area better just because hairs there were thicker. Didnt prevent from lil rash though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And 1 bottle is enough only to do legs and bikini... Not sure i will buy again. Razors are cheaper and faster to do the job.</li>
            <li> My first time using this product on my eyebrows I had only a small amount of pinkness and no sensitivity. The only problem I found was it&#x27;s trouble in retrieving the short finer hairs. You must let them grow out a bit before waxing for optimal results.It cleans most of the area up well leaving you to pluck the smaller hairs.    BTW, this is my husbands Amazon account(hence the male name lol) I am 100% female :)</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff.  It was very hard to work w/.  The stuff was a mess and didn&#x27;t want to spread.  The strips they provide are so small, it would take 100 of them to wax 1 leg.  Also my hair is very course and it simply didn&#x27;t work.    I threw the jar out after the first attempt.  Maybe the wax was old or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> Its a learning curve but its well worth it. Great results</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes. I had tried this same type of product for unwanted facial hair before without success, but decided to give this one a try.  Sadly, it does not remove the unwanted hair as advertised.  It would remove the very fine hair but even with repeated uses, still did not remove the stubborn coarse hair which is always the most annoying to deal with.  It is messy to work with, hard to apply, even when heated, does not spread smoothly and an all around a dud!  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I only wish I had discovered sugaring earlier! The package comes with everything you need, with plenty extra popsicle sticks and muslim. It removes hair very effectively, quickly, and most importantly PAINLESSLY! It feels like someone slapped you, but the pain disappears instantly. Results of waxing minus the pain. Just one thing- it didn&#x27;t work so well for hair that wasn&#x27;t thick, like my leg hair.</li>
            <li> Works great...Easy clean up with water if you get it on something you shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> With much saddness I must say that this product did not work. Unfortunatley I contacted   Amazon a day past the return allowance. I would not purchase this or tell a friend about this product, I would let them know that like most \\&quot;as seen on tv \\&quot; products they are not worth the money:(</li>
            <li> I was attempting to find an alternative to paying $50 for a bikini wax at the salon every month, so I tried this product.    I liked the smell and it was pretty easy to heat up in the microwave. I especially love the reusable cloth strips since they were really easy to wash clean after each use.    My issues came with the actual ripping process, because apparently I am a wimp when doing it to myself. I had gotten waxes at the salon for 2 years, but it is different when someone else is doing it and they distract you by talking to you about random things before ripping the hair out of your skin. I have to say, the pain was not really bad at all with this product, but I built it up in my head each time, which made the experience worse. The other issue is that if you take a long time with each strip, then the wax gets cold and needs to be reheated many times throughout the process. This could be avoided with a warmer though.    My last issue with this product compared to the salon wax, is that the hair started growing back within a week and a half. My hair is somewhat fine and actually would take about 3 weeks before it started to grow back after a visit to the salon.    All-in-all, I would reccommend this product for someone who is not a wimp at pulling the stips off themselves. Everything else about the product is good for a reasonably priced at-home kit.</li>
            <li> I bought moom because i dont have a microwave and was having a hard time finding any wax that could be used cold or heated on the stove-top. I started going to a salon after some injuries caused by self waxing a little while back. Self waxing is definitely a skill that takes time to learn. Sally Hanson products tend to take skin off and other waxes i had problems with bruising. I&#x27;ve used moom several times on bikini and lip and havent had any problems with either of those things. The instructions are a little different than other self waxing kits and i found it worked best when you follow it exactly. The only thing they say that i found didnt work was using the wax cold. It was much less effective cold but thankfully it can be washed away with water and theres no mess, which is great for skin and bathroom. Even the strips were amazingly easy to clean. I was skeptical about the claim that you can reuse the strips but it really does come off clean. My only warning about this product would be that it appears to break down a little after a few uses, which makes sense considering it is made from all natural ingredients, but its definitely a product that has to be reordered every few months. Considering one jar is around $20 and so far I&#x27;ve gotten more than $200 of salon priced removal out of it, i dont mind if when i get towards the bottom of the jar i need to spend another $20 on amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to go to salon for waxing my eyebrows and upperlip and that cost me about 30-35$ every month.  i never tried waxing at home but  after reading so many  good reviews, i wanted to try this product and i m very much pleased with the results :) It was not painful at all...it leaves the skin smooth too. i would highly recommend this to everyone:):)</li>
            <li> I searched for a long time to find a sugaring product I can use.  For a first timer, this product is simply effective and easy to use.  Thanks Moon for including all the tools I need in the kit and for effective use at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work. I love natural products but this one just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Tons of hair leftover and didn&#x27;t even try it on bikini area. I think I must be snestive to something in it (tea tree too?) because it left my legs itchy and red and really irritated. Its worth a try if your hair is fine maybe and your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive. That&#x27;s not me though.</li>
            <li> I received and am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I bought Moom probably about a month ago. It worked well on my legs, virtually no pain. However, I have ran into the problem that I have pretty thin leg hair, and can&#x27;t see if I missed some until after I put lotion on. Armpits, I couldn&#x27;t get work for the life of me. I think I did 1/2 of one armpit. I tried on about 4 different occasions, I tried baby powder/cornstarch as the directions suggested, no idea what the issue is. Bikini line and eyebrows worked fairly well. It&#x27;s wonderful that it dissolves in water and you can reuse the cloth strips. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s quite as powerful as normal wax, and how the time/moom cost compares to the cost of a professional wax job. I&#x27;ve spend a considerable amount of time doing this, but I guess I&#x27;ll get faster if I keep it up...</li>
            <li> What really attracted me to this product were the reviews, and now I can confirm that if you are used to going to a salon this product is a cinch to use. I previously tried a roll on wax which was messy and frankly it hurt to even apply it to my skin, and I have a high pain threshold. Moom went on easily and cleaned up just as easily. It really works, and you don&#x27;t need to apply thick layers. So if you are looking for a product that is simple to use and that does exactly what it says then this is well worth buying. Of course as with any waxing process there is some pain involved. If you want a long lasting method of hair removal that is simple to use then get this product.</li>
            <li> Moom is by far better at removing hair than anything I&#x27;ve bought from the store. I bought the starter kit years ago and from then on, I only use Moom for removing hair along my bikini line. It&#x27;s really easy after you get practice, the wax washes right off the strips and body with warm water and I always get great results every time I use it. I don&#x27;t have to put any sort of lotions on afterwards either; I just wash off and after half a day the reddness is gone and I&#x27;m hair-free. I usually stay that way for about two weeks even though the packaging says longer.</li>
            <li> Having never used a wax or sugaring product before, it took me the whole package of cloth strips to do my upper lip and chin.  However, it was not the product it was me.  Once I used a very thin layer of the mixture instead of the thick clump I started out doing and got the hang of how to lift, it worked wonderfully.  I washed all the strips and they are good to go for my next hair removal session.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  I let my leg hair grow for months before using this product.  The instructions said not to use on hair the was longer than 1/2&amp;#34; but it worked fine on my 3/4&amp;#34; leg hair.  It was very easy to use and not at all messy.  It cleans up with soap and hot water.  You can wash, dry and reuse the muslin fabric strips but they give you more than enough for a single use.  I thought it would hurt and make my legs red but it didn&#x27;t at all.  I used my tweezers to pluck a few hairs that I missed and my legs are smooth and hair free!  I would say I have enough product left over for three more applications on my lower legs.  I plan on using a loofa to make sure when the hair starts coming back that it doesn&#x27;t grow under the skin.  I&#x27;ll let you how it goes and how long until the hair comes back.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Product easily washes away with water.  I did not experience the redness/bruises that I do with normal wax.  Will use again!</li>
            <li> Most women have tried various hair removal products over the years. I for one have tried everything from shaving, to Nair to the dreaded and thankfully short-lived Epi-Lady. I had basically resigned myself to the shaving method until recently I felt adventurous again and decided it would be nice to wax the rest of my body myself instead of getting it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this product does EXACTLY what it says. It&#x27; rinses with water, the strips wash off VERY easily and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Now mind you when I set out to try this product, I did not have the ideal conditions: I have three children and I am 7 months pregnant with my 4th, so not only could I not not get too comfortable lifting my leg to wax it, I was constantly interrupted by my daughters...\\&quot;mommy, what are you doing in there? Why don&#x27;t you have on pants?\\&quot; So with that said, if you have a quiet, well-lit location with no children and you are not 7 months pregnant, you will probably love this product more and it will work even better for you. I managed to wax my legs fairly effortlessly. The hair came off easily and I was VERY satisfied with the results. I decided to be REALLY ambitious and try my bikini area...okay let&#x27;s not mention the fact I can&#x27;t even see my bikini area, I still decided to give it a try. That was a slightly more difficult task I will say and the hair did not come off as easily but I attribute that to the fact that it was difficult for me to see and determine the pattern of hair growth. I did the sides fairly well and the top of the bikini area was the most difficult mainly due to my pregnant belly. I decided to go back the next day and clean up the area and I did it laying back on the bed and I had much better success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product. My skin typically gets irritated by other waxes and products and with this, no redness, no bumps, no itching, no burning. I was truly amazed. This product is so easy to use that I will definitely do this over shaving or anything else from now on. I am sure once I can actually see my feet...among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more. A definite must-have!ing or anything else from now on. I am sure once I can actually see my feet...among other areas again, I will have a far easier time and will love it even more. A definite must-have!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all the great reviews by everyone else.  I had/have been going to nail salons and also to the beauty schools to remove my facial hair.  I don&#x27;t have black hair on my face it is just blonde and I just don&#x27;t like it.  Anyways after having my skin ripped off by all these \\&quot;so called professionals\\&quot;  I decided to do this my self.  This is a great product. Number 1. it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and it is water soluable so it washes right off.  Number 2. It does remove your facial hair just fine with no skin attached!    I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to sugaring and waxing altogether, so this was an experiment. I have really delicate skin and followed tips I read online about taking a pain reliever an hour before sugaring, using baby powder to create a barrier between the skin and sugar so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and then following up the sugaring with an aloe-based gel or lotion. Those tips saved me a lot of pain! Be careful not to get the sugar too hot or it will be really uncomfortable and may even burn. I love that the linen strips are reusable, and compared to salon prices, the refill jars are very affordable. Keeping a wet cloth nearby will help the process go more smoothly since sticky fingers make it difficult. The thing I love most about Moom is that it is all-natural so I&#x27;m not applying any harmful chemicals to my skin. No irritation or chemical burns from the sugar, even in the most sensitive areas. Happy sugaring!</li>
            <li> Messy, and doesn&#x27;t work well. My hairs broke off as opposed to being pulled out as it should.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wax, but when I got fed up with shaving every couple of days, I tried Moom&#x27;s sugar-based hair remover. It was the most amazing thing ever! Since I&#x27;m Asian, my hair is thin; waxing was always a hassle because my hair was never long enough. Moom, on the other hand, removed almost everything. I had to go back with tweezers to pluck stray hairs but it was a lot friendlier than waxing and shaving.    The pros definitely outweigh the cons!    Pros  -It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, so you can wax your skin multiple times without much irritation. I&#x27;ve heard you shouldn&#x27;t wax the same place several times because you can tear off skin. Everyone is different, but Moom didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at when I went over places it had missed. I got little red bumps from pulling hair out, but they didn&#x27;t hurt.  -The only pain you feel is from the actual hair removal. The after is nothing like wax - it doesn&#x27;t burn!  -Moom only grabs onto your hair, not your skin, too. Unlike waxing, which also grabs live cells, Moom doesn&#x27;t tear your skin.  -You don&#x27;t need to microwave it! Although it&#x27;s easier to spread when it&#x27;s warmer, it&#x27;s still pliable at room temperature (75 degrees).  -If you make a mistake, no problem! Unlike wax, which requires special oils to remove, Moom is made out of sugar, so it washes off very easily with water, which also allows you to reuse the cloth!  -It grabs short hair! My hair is short and not course, but it grabbed hair that was less than a quarter of an inch, which is the recommended length for Moom.    Cons  -Like all hair removal products, it misses hair sometimes. But unlike wax, you can go back over with Moom instead of using tweezers.  -Ok, I really can&#x27;t think of anything else.    A couple tips:  -If you decide to warm up the wax by letting it float in hot water, make sure to put the Moom jar in the container, then fill the container up with water. I did the opposite (I put water in a bowl, then dropped the Moom jar in), and water got in the jar. Because Moom is made out of sugar, the water liquefied a chunk of Moom. I poured out the water and destroyed Moom from the jar, but we&#x27;ll see if it still works in the next couple of month.  -If you&#x27;re waxing sensitive areas for the first time (like the bikini area), use the small strips designated for your eyebrows/lip/chin.   -Make sure you pull the cloth as parallel to your skin as possible. It hurts less. Make sure you hold your skin taunt too, because it also reduces the pain.    I usually don&#x27;t write long reviews, but Moom is definitely the way to go! Forget the hard and soft waxes - they just hurt! Trust me, if you&#x27;re waxing for the first time, especially in the bikini area, choose Moom!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for 3 years now. I&#x27;ve gone to the salon a few times only to find it extremely over priced. I then started buying store brands since they were more convenient. Store brands were somewhat painful and extremely hard to clean. They usually never included enough wax strips to do 2 full legs. I bought Moom from curiosity, and found the product to be great. Cleaning was an ease and the pain level was reduced. Keep in mind that waxing will never be completely painless. The reusable wax strips do tend to leave a stray hair here and there, but they are reusable! I do recommend buying more though. The wax itself spreads much more easily than other brands and does not need to be heated as long. 15 - 30 seconds is probably enough, and the consistency stays the same for a longer period of time. All in all, I definitely recommend Moom. I have tried anywhere between 5 and 10 products, and Moom is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> Sticky! This stuff was a MESS!! Unless you are a pro at self-waxing, avoid sugar-style wax. This stuff is insanely sticky, and I felt completely overwhelmed once I got started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heated the jar as instructed, and then began. Silly me, I really thought I could do this alone. I used one of the larger wooden sticks to spread the first layer, and the first mistake was made. My first layer was WAY too thick. I put the fabric over, and pulled, only to end up with it coming off like you&#x27;re pulling perfectly prepared pizza slices complete with just the right amount of cheese. The fabric was pulling away slowly, and had strands of the wax pulling while I winced. And whimpered. So grab another fabric swatch, and do it again. This one was more successful, as I had pulled most of the wax off with the first strip. Of course, it hurt like a mother because I essentially went over the same area twice. A no-no in waxing. I was also using the large strips. Unbeknownst to me, it would have been wiser to use the small. More control, and less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I laid down the second swipe of wax, I made SURE to use MUCH less. I was still using big strips, and so I was coming up with a decent amount of hair, but I felt like I was wasting the dang strips. Once you use the bottom of the larger strips, you don&#x27;t want to touch that side because of the stickiness. That nixes your ability to use the same side but opposite end of that strip. You can flip it over and use the opposite side, but thats it. On some, I folded them, but that wasn&#x27;t highly successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I switched to the smaller strips, I was in a bit more control of the usage of them, but I also had my hands COVERED in this stupid wax. My fingers were sticking together at the knuckles and my pinky was stuck curled up. Every time I pulled them all apart it felt like I had submerged my hands in glue and honey. Not exactly how you want to feel when waxing sensitive areas. It makes it especially hard to keep skin taught when you&#x27;re getting stuck to it at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only got about 2/3 of the way done before I had to just give up not only due to being sticky, but because the darn container cooled and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and I was not motivated enough to wash off, reheat, and begin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup... it washes away with warm water. At least one promise held true. I was able to wash off easily, and I had set the jar on the side of my sink, where the bottom had some on it, creating a ring that stuck to the sink. It also came off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT try this for the 1st time right before anything sexy or important. Like Valentines, or a Wedding. Or Swimming. Just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice, through pain induced misted eyes that I did NOT have the same red bumps or ingrown hair issues as I get with shaving, and as sensitive as the skin is, the redness faded and it was soft. The hair took a fair amount of time to return, (thank you all things GOOD and SWEET!), but I&#x27;m not sure I would venture to use this one again. I think I would on tougher areas, such as lower legs... but for sensitive areas such as underarms, bikini, and face? I&#x27;m going to look in to hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or a professional. $40 never seemed like such a bargain. *whimper*.kin taught when you&#x27;re getting stuck to it at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only got about 2/3 of the way done before I had to just give up not only due to being sticky, but because the darn container cooled and so I couldn&#x27;t spread any more wax without cursing 10 different kinds of unholy words, and I was not motivated enough to wash off, reheat, and begin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim for this particular wax is that it is easy cleanup... it washes away with warm water.

            <li> I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blisters after waxing. To make matters worse, I had shingles a few years ago on the left side on my face. While the shingles lesions quickly went away, I was left with pretty severe post herpetic neuralgia (aka: pain) on the left side of my face. This pain has made waxing and tweezing excruciating. In addition, I have very pale skin and dark hairs on my upper lip.     We have a few \\&quot;sugaring\\&quot; salons in the area, but it is very pricey to have sugaring done. I found this product while doing an Amazon search. I purchased the classic kit (with tea tree oil).    I tried my Moom for the first time yesterday on my upper lip and eyebrow area. This product is amazing. I agree with all of the reviewers: Easy to apply, easy to clean up, and (for me anyway) virtually pain free. I had a little bit of redness (above my eyebrow on the side that was affected by shingles), but the redness quickly went away. NO Bumps! No blisters!! 100% hair free - Whoo Hoo!    Before using this product, I do recommend going to the Moom website. They have some very helpful educational information and a video tutorial which I found very helpful. While waxing my eyebrows, I used toothpicks to apply the sugar. The toothpicks were just the size I needed to direct the sugar over my fine eyebrow hairs.     I will NEVER spend money to go to a sugaring/waxing salon again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even though it removed some hairs it left A LOT and my eyebrows still look un-waxed. I am very unhappy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it does a pretty decent job. (Of course, there could be some operator error causing the &amp;#34;not pefectness.&amp;#34;) And, it&#x27;s sure a lot cheaper than paying someone to do the job for me every other week. - UPDATE to my review. The original package I got of Moom came with some strips to use to remove the product when pulling out the hair. They were a soft muslin cloth and were easy to smooth on my face. Unfortunately, my husband mistakenly threw away those strips and I had to order a new package. The new package came with heavy, muslin-looking strips but they&#x27;re stiff and highly ineffective. If you wanted to cut your own strips out of a soft, cotton muslin, which I don&#x27;t, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still a good product, but unless they change the type of fabric strips they send with the product, I can no longer recommend it - which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> ... useful, nice and pleasant ;)&lt;br /&gt;... and tasty as well... no need to buy chupa chups anymore :)</li>
            <li> This is not a wax but rather a sugar-based product. It just does NOT work -- on the legs one would have to do the same spot over and over again to see any good results; and for eyebrows - simply useless: it does not pick up the tiny hair -- which is the whole point of waxing eyebrows. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair removal kit I&#x27;ve tried!  I&#x27;m just going to go over the pros and cons.    Pros:  1) It much less painful than normal waxing  2) The strips are reusable   3) Clean up is much MUCH quicker and easier.  The wax is water soluble so a little bit of water is all you need to clean up excess wax on your body, any wax that dripped on the counter top or floor ,etc...  4) It&#x27;s very cheap      Cons:  1) It misses a little bit of hair, but I&#x27;m not sure any waxing kit is going to get your professional results  2) Your hair has to be super long before MOOM will work.  I&#x27;ve used the Nair waxing kit, and it&#x27;ll remove hair after a week of not shaving my legs.  MOOM didn&#x27;t remove any hair after only a week&#x27;s growth.  The directions do say to let your hair grow out a certain length, but that&#x27;s just not realistic when it&#x27;s spring time in Texas. But it worked GREAT on my bikini area that hadn&#x27;t been taken care of in a month or two.   3) It takes a while to work all the wax off of the strip if you&#x27;re going to reuse them.  It took me around 20 minutes to clean off 4 strips.    I definitely recommend this if your hair is long enough, but if not, normal waxing would be better.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right, but I tried every way possible.  A whopping 3 hairs came out from my eyebrows and maybe 2 from my boyfriend&#x27;s chest.  Sad day.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after the raving reviews that I read. This is an all natural, no wax hair removal product. My problem that I encounter was that it caused ulgy whiteheads/red skin irritation on my face. Despite properly cleansing my face the bumps/whiteheads/redness lingered for several days . It&#x27;s sticky &amp; stringy like wax so I wasn&#x27;t very good at controlling the application and accidently ripped out more eyebrows than wanted. I will try on my legs next to see if I have better results. One thing that&#x27;s nice about this is that the cloths that are use to place over the sugar substance can be washed and reused.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m disabled; my disability makes it a challenge to control my body. Secondly, I&#x27;m on blood thinners, so I bruise easy. Thirdly, this was my first ever waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped shaving the end of last summer because it had become such a mess. No matter what I did, I didn&#x27;t have enough control to keep from nicking myself all over the place and being on blood thinners, it looked like a brutal murder had taken place for hours afterwards. My biggest concerns about waxing were about being able to rip the strips off properly, the bruising and the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I set everything up and prepared for a long agonizing process and found it not to be so at all! I&#x27;m thinking since I haven&#x27;t shaved in a while (which in Arizona, the end of summer is like November when it finally cools off enough.) so perhaps the hair was finer than if I had been shaving. My first challenge was keeping the wax warm enough for me to be able to spread, which of course is a challenge for me anyways. Being disabled, constantly going to the micro wasn&#x27;t really an option. I would have worn myself out too much to finish. Keep in mind it&#x27;s 78 degrees in here and yet I couldn&#x27;t keep the product warm enough to spread easily enough. I solved that by turning off the overhead fan and I put the product jar in a bowl with warm water. I put the strip on and clenched for anticipated agony. Rip. Huh, that was no big deal at all! Since this was my first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in this option in case it didn&#x27;t work out, but I plan on getting a warmer for next time, and there will definitely be a next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next issue to solve was a bit of a sticky mess. This is mostly due to my bodily issues; I found that my hands were getting a bit sticky when I was rubbing the strip before pulling, but also when my body was jerking around, I was getting the product all over my arms, hands and oxygen tubing. This was easily solved by having a damp wash cloth next to me. I don&#x27;t imagine others will have to deal with this quite the same way I do, but you may find your hands get sticky and the damp wash cloth will be very handy. I probably used more wax then most people might, even still, if I used this same amount again, it looks like I would have at least four more leg waxings. I expect I will be using less next time, as I found that I didn&#x27;t need to spread more product on each time, but just put the strip with some wax already on it onto the next section, rub it to warm the product, wait a moment for it to cool, and then rip again and repeat until it wasn&#x27;t sticky enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, I was concerned about the pain and the bruising. The pain was quite tolerable for me, in the most sensitive areas it was perhaps a 3 or 4 in the pain scale where 10 is the worst. I mention again the blood thinners cause me to bruise when the wind blows, however I found that I had little bruising. I tried to position my leg to keep the skin as tight as I could and then didn&#x27;t need to try to use my hand to keep it taught except for a couple of places, but I didn&#x27;t make the skin taught there and thus received a bit of mottled bruising. This being my first time, I figured out not to do that again and therefore it wasn&#x27;t an issue anymore.  I put some Arnica Cream on and it&#x27;s not that big of a deal actually. I guess there was one more concern, my red-headed daughter tried to get professionally waxed and ended up very red, irritated and bruised. I have very sensitive skin and found there is no irritation or redness whatsoever. I was also a bit concerned, this being my first time, and I&#x27;ve never even been professionally waxed, but I found the instructions to be very adequate and the process simple.&lt;br /&gt;My legs feel silky soft and pretty. Even though this was my first time and thus I would expect it to take longer to do the whole thing, it probably took less than an hour, but in my case, the need to move back and forth to get things (re-heat the product, get a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time. Next time I will have a warmer and everything set up at the start and my guess is that it will take about 20 minutes, including having to clean up from body jerks into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was wonderfully easy and I have great results!  I chose this product because of the reviews stating that they had minimal redness, easy clean-up and good results. I&#x27;m not disappointed, in fact I am extremely pleased and would recommend this to anybody interested in being waxed.a damp wash cloth, etc) then having to rest in between is what took most of the time.

            <li> I ordered moom for my daughter who suddenly had hair growth on her face and body.  I had tried other facial hair removers and they actually burned her face.  Looking for an alternative to tweezing, I ordered moom.  A little messy and took a little bit to do it correctly, but this product works great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like hot wax I&#x27;ve used on myself in the past.  Left her skin soft and its been 2 weeks, no sign of regrowth</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!   I have dark hair....so removing my underarm hair has always been a struggle. Shaving my underarms never cut it for me, as I could always still see the hair underneath the skin. Other wax-at-home kits that I&#x27;ve tried, have proven to be messy, painful, and still not getting me the results I wanted. This product, however-- was easy, not messy, and my under arms are smooth and clear looking. I would reccomend this to anyone that is wanting to try waxing at home. Thank you Moom! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past couple months on my face and it does take away unwanted hair without being too painful. It is a bit difficult for me to use this though because my skin is sensitive and I can only do a little bit of my face at a time or my face is tomato red for around four or more hours (even with applying a moisturizer and staying out of the sun). I also cannot get this to work for my chin hairs (even with their tips in the booklet). If anyone has any tips for the chin, please comment and let me know. Overall, it works better than any other hair remover I&#x27;ve ever used (Nads, Veet, Nair, Tweezers). It also comes off so easily, which is perfect for when you use too much or drop some of it on your skin. It also makes my skin feel smooth and soft afterward, which is a nice bonus. I really do love this product, but the issue with the chin and the redness is the reason for the 4/5, as it&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment for me in that respect.</li>
            <li> I have used original Moom Wax in the past, which worked perfectly. I purchased the tea tree formula hoping it would work just as well. This wax barely removes any hair! The muslin strips just remove the wax from skin.</li>
            <li> I have had some experience doing my own waxing at home, so i wanted to try something new, well... i followed al the instructions and it just removed like 5% of my total hair!! it didn&#x27;t work... i tried several times and it just didn&#x27;t remove any hair!!! and watch out if you heat it too long, it might just burn your skin! literaly! i got a burn on my leg for over 2 weeks! save your money !!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but more tired of spending 20$ at a time for waxing my armpit. So I tried. And I am really happy I did!  It is very easy (I had never waxed myself before), just as or less painful than in the salon, and it actually works great!! In 10 minutes I was done with a totally satisfactory result.   I also like that you can just wash it off with water and does not leave any nasty residuals. I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to remove unwanted facial hair that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling raw like the wax strips that I used to use.      Wow, was I surprised. Compared to waxing, sugar is nearly painless. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was ripping off an old bandage, I just feel the sticky sugar lifting off of my skin.     If you miss some hairs, it&#x27;s easy to go over the same spot again without making it sore. I also noticed that the redness faded quickly after the hair removal. I just used it today (about 30 min ago) and the red spot I had near my upper lip is gone.    Also, I really like that the sugar washes off with water instead of needing an oil to remove it, because I don&#x27;t normally buy baby oil,  or have a bottle of that blue stuff that comes with wax available. I have combination skin, so I don&#x27;t need any more oil on my face!     I expect the jar that came with this package will last a long time because I only use it on small areas. A six or seven dollar box of wax strips would last a month or two if I was lucky, so this is a much better bargain. If the included fabric strips wear out, I can go to the fabric store, buy a yard of muslin fabric for less than $2, and make my own with a pair of scissors, I figure.    To anyone wondering if they should give this a try, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Okay, MOOM is good. The stuff works and its a great, natural product.  All those women claiming that they&#x27;ve managed to maintain use of the same jar of MOOM for like 6-8 months need to break down for me how they did it. So, obviously I have a gripe about the amount.  Its not enough. I was applying the thinnest possible layers, and I doubt there is enough left in the jar for me to even think about having it around for me to do BOTH of my legs again. Maybe its because they&#x27;re so long but come on I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7, so that doesn&#x27;t make me an amazon ;) and I might be thick, but my legs are NOT that big. Overall I think its a fantastic product.  Take it easy on the first use.  I had some slight bleeding/scabbing. They were VERY tiny though. I have never done anything like this before, so I guess my hairs were holding on for dear life. I just don&#x27;t have time for all that shaving, when I&#x27;m taking all these classes in an effort to finish my BSN. Toodles!</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my legs and facial hair. I do love that it is so easy to use and clean up. I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water. However, it doesn&#x27;t wax out all my hair. It always leaves behind hair which kind of defeats my whole purpose of using it at the beginning, I guess my hair is a bit too thick for it?</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used several different brands that I&#x27;ve picked up at Target or Wal-mart. The other wax hair removal kits would usually leave a mess or there would not enough acetone to remove the excess wax or not enough strips. This product solved all the above. The wax is removed with just warm or hot water and the strips are reusable. It didn&#x27;t give instruction on how to clean the strips but I found out that all you needed to do was run it under water and rinse it.</li>
            <li> I had been going for professional waxing or using other famous brands for sensitive skin.  A friend suggested this product so I bought this kit and I love it!  It&#x27;s easy to heat with the glass jar and super easy to clean both my skin after use and the cloth strips, just use warm water, no soap needed!  My skin was not left irritated or bumpy like with pro-waxing or other brands!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> i thought i was using it wrong...so i made my sister let me try it on her...worked fine!! i guess it doesnt work on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading others reports who had tried it. I had been hoping to use it as an alternative to shaving. They recommended first doing it with a certain length so I let my hair grow which wasn&#x27;t easy. Once I started using it, I was very displeased. It doesn&#x27;t heat well at all and was very difficult to use/apply. It did remove some of the hair but left areas where it didn&#x27;t. It hurt and was uncomfortable. I stopped using it after the first time.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this is that it is such easy clean up. I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water. It works really well also. Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area. If you don&#x27;t it will get stuck and hurt a lot! But in general it is great!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It definitely takes some time to perfect the technique, particularly if you have never waxed before, and it can get pretty messy, but the good news is that it is quite easy to clean up with water, and I found the result of all the hard work to be much more satisfying than shaving. Having never waxed before, I am not in a position to say how the pain compares, but I will say that I was surprised by the excruciating pain I endured whilst mooming previously only shaved areas. My reasonably high pain tolerance was no match for the thickest of my dark hairs, and I would suggest practicing on less sensitive areas before giving yourself a brazilian (regrettably I do speak from experience). I will say that I had to go over some areas multiple times to get all the hair, but I attribute this to my inexperience, and I found that areas of finer hair yielded more. All in all, I found the results were to my liking, and I thought the price was reasonable since you can get a lot of hair from just a tiny application of the paste.</li>
            <li> I ordered thinking it was going to be great because all the reviews seemed real and honest and made it sound like it really worked. But it didn&#x27;t work at all. It barely took the hair off the legs. It left my lip itchy and red and barely took any hair off. The prodcut was horrible. Thank god I got a refund. This crap is going in the trash!!</li>
            <li> I was always burning myself or making my skin bleed by ripping out the hairs so forcefully.</li>
            <li> I assumed by other reviews that this would probably work for me. I ordered it and studied how to use it properly. After doing everything according to direction several times, I only ended up with a really red patch of skin with less than a third of the hair pulled out. It just does not grip thick dark hairs. Perhaps it works if you have very light thin hairs, but if yours are coarse or dark DO NOT buy this. It hurt a lot and was ineffective.</li>
            <li> I bought it after I read all the reviews on Amazon. However, this product does not work on me, it is very messy and took me more than 30mins just to remove hair from a small part. I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see this product working perfectly! I bought this to give it a try, even thought I saw many reviewers complaining. It&#x27;s really good, a little painful though, but comparing to wax (which I hated after the first use) it&#x27;s much better and more gentle. I have a sensitive skin, and as I expected the skin was quite red and it was irritated for a couple of days after use but I hope after repeated uses it will get better. I first tried it on my arms, where the hair is much stronger then on the legs (which I used to shave or epilate) and I was amazed to see the hair being removed so easy. Great stuff and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s even organic!  UPDATE  After 3 uses I realize it doesn&#x27;t deserve a lot of praise and I gave it 3 stars. It&#x27;s easy to use and not as painful, but the hair grows back so fast, in ONE week it&#x27;s back!</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and sensitive skin. When I use wax, my skin gets angry red and it hurts for a few days. This product leaves my skin nice and soft and it works, but it does take longer to use. To remove the hairs, I focus on a small area at a time (maybe half an inch by half an inch). So it&#x27;s OK if you have more time and patience.</li>
            <li> Ive never heard of this brand before but all of the reviews were great so I tried it. I have tried over the counter Sallys wax products that work better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Cute packaging- organic- nice marketing concept/ however I am very familiar with waxing as I have been doing it forever. IU wanted  a compact kit for travels and so I tried this at home first. Read all of the instructions carefully and literally... waste of time. I am an ordinary person, with normal hair ( not to coarse or thin ) and this just never worked each time I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to pay any amount of money for good products... but this product is just a waste of time and money. Seriously, this company needs to fire whoever did testing on effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried waxing once before and it was a traditional wax and I remember it being very messy and painful. This was years ago and after reading the reviews for this product I decided to give it a try. It works great, with very detailed directions that help you get results. It has a very pleasant, light scent and even though I am inexperienced, I waxed both my arms in 30 minutes (with also reading the directions). I&#x27;m not sure I will be taking on the task of leg waxing quite yet, but I will definitely be doing my arms again as well as bikini and eyebrows. I would definitely recommend this kit! And what a great price!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and could tell right away that the product worked as advertised.  What I like the most about this is that it is such easy clean up when you are finished and you dont have any gross residue. I can find it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water. It works really well for removing hair also. Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area because otherwise you just waste it and it is more clean up and could be irratating. If you don&#x27;t it will get stuck.</li>
            <li> Moom Hair Removal Kit with Tea Tree did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  Do not waste your money or your time on this product.  I carefully read the directions and exactly followed them, and tried again on 3 separate occasions. I don&#x27;t think it even removed one hair.  I can&#x27;t imagine how there are any reviewers who this actually works for. This product did smell good and was not at all irritating to my skin, but it does nothing for its intended purpose.  Shave, wax or save up your money for laser treatments, but don&#x27;t spend it here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wavering between 3 and 4 stars for this product. I&#x27;ve had mixed results with MOOM. I like that it&#x27;s made from simple organic ingredients and comes with plenty of spatulas and muslin strips. MOOM is relatively cost effective because the spatulas and strips are reusable (just wash them with hot water). You can microwave the jar, which is convenient. MOOMing is not painless like the descriptions claim, but pulling hair out using any method is going to be painful. I found MOOMing about as painful as waxing. I did make a mess initially, but you learn how to avoid drips and spills. Clean up on skin, bathroom surfaces, and clothes is super easy with hot water. This is a nice advantage over waxes, which require baby oil or wax removal products to clean.  I&#x27;m mainly disappointed in MOOM because it&#x27;s not very effective for me. I&#x27;m Asian and have fairly fine, soft hair. MOOM only works on my coarser hair and even then I often have to do it 3+ times to get most of the hair. It is completely ineffective on finer hair on my legs or face, which is frustrating. I thought I was using poor technique, but I&#x27;ve tried using it every which way: applying MOOM thin, applying it thick, applying in all different directions compared to hair growth, applying after a warm shower, pulling muslin slow, pulling it fast, pulling it off in different directions. I&#x27;ve given up and concluded that MOOM can&#x27;t handle softer hair on my legs, upper lip, or eyebrow.   You have to practice to perfect your technique and maximize MOOM&#x27;s effectiveness. Dry the area with cornstarch or baby powder. Spread it in a very thin layer, apply the muslin strip, rub it a few times, and pull the muslin strip off quickly and parallel to the skin. Don&#x27;t burn yourself on the MOOM, which seems to get hotter than wax with less time in the microwave. Even though the directions say to apply the MOOM in the direction of the hair growth and pull the muslin strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth, I found it&#x27;s more effective if I MOOM several times in both directions. Be sure to hold the skin as taut as possible.  Pros:  - It&#x27;s inexpensive. The MOOM kit has everything: popsicle sticks, muslin strips, the MOOM, and directions. You don&#x27;t need a wax warmer or more sticks/strips if you wash and reuse them.  - It&#x27;s got that holistic, natural thing going on if that&#x27;s important to you.  - Clean up is so easy - just use hot water or a warm wet towel.  - It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out or irritate my skin. I have acne prone skin, and the MOOM doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Cons:  - It takes some practice to learn how to use it effectively.   - It doesn&#x27;t work on fine hair! HUGE BUMMER.  I wanted to love MOOM so much. It&#x27;s made from organic products and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals! Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. I&#x27;m more satisfied with other products, like GiGi Strip Free Wax, which is easy to use and much more effective.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product because of all the rave reviews I had seen about it.  Let me tell you, this wax is AMAZING!  It is easy to apply, remove, and does an excellent job with the hair.  The only downside is that it can be slightly messy, but if you are careful it is easily manageable because it comes off with water (and perhaps a little bit of soap).  I am never going back to a salon again!  Awesome, awesome product.</li>
            <li> I hated the rashes from depilatories and hated the troubles of wax. Moom allows me to spend more time actually removing hair, and less time preparing. Less heat, strips, and it&#x27;s not wax? Wonderful! Great for my upper lip and bikini line! I&#x27;m a Moom believer!  ****Update**** At first, I was in love with this product, but as time went on, while Moom is good on the face, it seemed to give me underarm pimples. I think that was removal for armpits just didn&#x27;t work for me. Back to the drawing board....</li>
            <li> When I first used this, it was the most painful experience EVER. I got teary eyed. I&#x27;m not a big baby but I thought I had wasted my money when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I decided not to let that get in my way so I used it again a few weeks later and TADAH....No pain. I was whoa confused. But I guess after the first time I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used traditional waxing and SUGAR waxing is way less painful and this is SO EASY to clean up.</li>
            <li> I previously tried Surgi-wax Brazilian hard waxing kit, and it was an extremely painful and messy experience.  I was about to give up on waxing when I stumbled upon reviews for Moom.  Moom sugar wax is amazing!  No where near as painful as hard wax!  I waxed my legs completely and wanted to keep going.  (I had already had a professional Brazilian wax to fix my terrible Surgi-wax experience, so I couldn&#x27;t wax my bikini area.  But I will be waxing my bikini area with Moom as soon as it grows back.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;Moom removes about 90-95% of the hair.  You can also re-do an area without any hassle.  The washable strips are a bonus, and you can cut the larger ones down with pinking shears if you feel the need to.  If you run out of sticks, just use popsicle sticks or craft sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Read the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;- Heat it for only ten seconds at a time, then 5 seconds at a time after that&lt;br /&gt;- I found that leaving the wax and strip on for 10-20 seconds helped it stick to the hair&lt;br /&gt;- You can also apply the wax in the opposite direction of hair if it&#x27;s not pulling it all off&lt;br /&gt;- Baby powder helps separate hair from the legs&lt;br /&gt;- Do not bathe before waxing (you get red bumps and the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair as well); simply wipe the area with a damp washcloth&lt;br /&gt;- Fill up the bottom of the tub (or sink) with hot water and place the strips in them immediately after use (the water takes the wax right off)&lt;br /&gt;- After buying the kit, just buy the 12 oz refill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make your own sugar wax (recipes found online).  I haven&#x27;t had any positive experiences with homemade wax, so I will continue buying Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
            <li> The product is great, I&#x27;m quite happy w/ the results... if only more strips came with it though. I would definitely buy this again, my sensitive skin has no complaints! I wouldn&#x27;t buy the pre-waxed strips again though they left this awful residue on my skin, this was nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sooo much trouble being a hirstute woman. It is costly and time-consuming going to the salon regularly and at-home waxing kits are a mess. Also my skin is so sensitive that I had to switch from waxing to threading, which lasts less time. Thank goodness I ordered this product. It is saving me a fortune and it is easy to use. It is wonderful being able to do a quick hair removal as soon as I notice some extra hairs instead of waiting until the problem is bad enough to justify a trip to the salon.    The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really have the hang of pulling the strips and it didn&#x27;t work. I gave Moom one more try before I trashed it and am so glad I did. It effectively removes all but a few stubborn hairs and my skin doesn&#x27;t turn red at all. If I do make a little mess with this product, it washes off quite easily with water. It also doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like waxing did. Timesaver and moneysaver! I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> I used most of this pretty fast, there isn&#x27;t enough to do your entire legs, but maybe one. The strips are cleanable and the stuff breaks down with water, so it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to get off the skin.    The only downside is you have to make sure you get the strip well attached first, because if not when you rip it off it doesn&#x27;t always work.    Overall the best type of this product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gosh darned frustrating when I order a product with great reviews....and then it blows!      I tried the product every which way: tried places on my body with thinner hair...then coarser hair  ....I tried heating it up more....then a little less.  ....I tried applying a thin coat....then a thicker coat.    NOTHING WORKED!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your time friends!</li>
            <li> It is one of the best wax I have used.. No residue and it even didn&#x27;t inflame the skin. Very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I had been using a chemical hair remover on my face and it always irritated my skin, but recently I suffered a bad chemical burn. I went in search of something more natural and effective and ordered Moom based on the customer reviews. I just finished using the Moom on my entire face, which took about a half hour. Not only was it easy, it was kind of fun. Now I can&#x27;t stop touching my face and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else for hair removal. I&#x27;m going to be recommending this product to all my girlfriends and my daughters.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but I only used it twice before I stopped bothering. It is messy, requires a lot of materials, takes a long time, is fairly painful, etc. This is definitely easier than DIY sugar waxing but isn&#x27;t any better than a razor or epilator in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this product works really well if you use it properly. i bought it to use on my bikini area but it works on finer facial hair as well. here are some tips for using the product:    * make sure you&#x27;re hair is in the right length range - 1/4\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; works best in my experience. if the hair is too long or short the product won&#x27;t work. you can buy a beard/bikini trimmer to uniformly trim the hair to the right length.  * wash the area before waxing (any lotions, natural oils, etc will interfere with the ability of the product to stick to the hair)  * thoroughly dry the area before waxing and if necessary, keep a tissue with you to wipe off areas that may get wet/damp again (like underarms)   * the wax consistency should be fluid, but don&#x27;t overheat so it&#x27;s like water  * apply a thin coat - a thick coat will just leave you with a gooey mess  * after putting the strip on the waxed area, make sure you rub it (not hard but quickly) right before pulling it off - this helps with adhesion  * make sure your skin is taught before pulling the strip off - if it isn&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get a lot of pain and no hair removal  * sometimes you&#x27;ll get a little strip of hair that got the wax on it but wasn&#x27;t pulled out. don&#x27;t put more wax on it and try to pull it out again - move on to other areas, then wash and dry the areas that need to be gone over again and start fresh. when i do my (entire) bikini area i usually have to repeat the process three times to get all the little spots that didn&#x27;t work the first time through.  * if you&#x27;re using this product on your bikini area and you&#x27;ve never waxed before, expect some mild to moderate pain the first time. by the third time the hair comes out really easily and the pain level is non-existent to mild, depending on the area. i also used this on my face and legs and never had any sort of pain, even the first time.     overall i&#x27;m very pleased with this product, especially because the hair comes out easier the more you use it. the effect definitely does noteven come close to lasting for two months as the description says it can. for me it lasts about a week before the hair is noticeable, then takes about another half week to get long enough to wax again. i&#x27;ve done my legs and upper lip twice and my bikini area four times and have used about 3/4 of the jar so i&#x27;m ordering again. i&#x27;m getting the whole kit again because i need more strips but next time i&#x27;ll just get the refill jar. great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easily removes hair with no pain at all. But in my case my hair starts to grow within 2 weeks, but on product it was written that at least for 2 months there will be no hair growth. So little bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I tried this once. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I am not sure yet whether it is my lack of experience with this product or the product itself. I will give it another chance. Especially that there are some good reviews to this product which makes me think that if it works for some other people it still may work for me.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best home hair removal product I have ever used.  I bought a single package with a 6 oz jar of Moom, 12 body and 6 face washable fabric strips, plus a few applicators for under $15(US).  Over a year later, I am using the SAME fabric strips and still have half the jar of Moom remaining!  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  Extremely affordable AND effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily to remove facial hair (upper lip and chin), and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  It washes away with water alone, and my pores are never clogged.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it was working, so I watched the tutorial video and tried again.  I now prep by washing my face, drying entirely, then smoothing on an extremely small amount of baby powder or cornstarch.  I spread the sugaring solution MUCH thinner than I ever would have thought to do on my own, and I reuse areas of the same strip (without adding more product) by pressing it back against my skin and rubbing quickly to warm it up, then cooling and removing again.  I was amazed to find that it actually works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse the fabric strips with warm water when I&#x27;m done and press them flat to dry.  They still work 100% as well as the first time I used them.  The only additional purchase I made was a pack of toothpicks, which I use to smooth the product onto my face.  The original applicators definitely do the job, but toothpicks allow for a bit more accuracy, and you can just discard them instead of washing at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how much hair comes out with every strip, and with very little pain.  Of course it stings (you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your skin - I think we all have realistic expectations here), but the difference with sugar solutions like this is that after you pull the first strip and most of the hair is removed, the second strip only grabs the remaining hair, not the skin.  After the first strip on a particular area, the second one barely stingsat all.  If you still see hairs, smooth on a bit more baby powder and the next strip will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product for facial hair removal.  The added bonus is that it smells and tastes good, and it is more natural than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  Of course you don&#x27;t care what it tastes like, but when you&#x27;re spreading a product directly under your nose, it is important that it is made from all natural ingredients.  If you accidentally lick your lips and get a bit of it in your system, it&#x27;s awesome to know that you aren&#x27;t ingesting noxious chemicals, but rather a fairly natural compound that will do less harm than eating a bite of a sugary dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product!  Watch the tutorial, follow the instructions, and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I was a little skeptical about self hair removal. I didn&#x27;t want to hurt myself or make a mess or just spend money on something useless. All of my worries were for nothing. Unlike wax, which you have to heat an be very careful where you put it on your body, Moom can be used unheated or just slightly heated and you can rinse or soak in water if you applied it somewhere you didn&#x27;t actually want it.    The little booklet with directions is great too. It explains perfectly how to heat it, apply it, remove it, everything. I started on an area with very light, fine hair to test for easy removal. It worked wonders. I then moved to more coarse hairs (I have very coarse hair in some areas) and it did have some trouble with the semi-recently shaved stuff. But if you do as the booklet says and wait 2 weeks after shaving an area, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be just fine. Any area not recently shaved had no problem.  I do dread the idea of spending the time doing large areas like my whole leg. I&#x27;ll leave that to the professionals. But for small, quick, hair removal, Moom is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review about anything before, but I got Moom in the mail today and WOW! This stuff is amazing. A little info about me...I&#x27;ve been brazilian waxing for years and I still HATE it. It hurts bad and gives me anxiety no matter what. However, I brazilianed myself today and it was almost painless. I am still in shock at how well this product works. You do have to have the technique, but I am far from a professional and the product worked great for me!!!! Seriously Moom,  where have you been all my life?</li>
            <li> This wax doesn&#x27;t have a good grip of the hair. I have to use it on the same area multiple times to get rid of the hair,  and my hair is not even thick. The only thing that I like about this product is the cloth that comes with it which I use it for another wax. The wax itself was not a really good one, and it gets cool down easily. When I use the other wax, I don&#x27;t need to reheat it but I have to do it a few times.</li>
            <li> I like the cruelty-free ingredients -- in fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this product in the first place. It is so sticky, though -- whether it&#x27;s warm or cold, the wax stays very sticky. You cannot twist the cap back on because the wax never fully hardens -- it stays sticky so you just have to sort of gently lay the cap back on the container. It&#x27;s impossible to use this product without getting wax all over your hands and bathroom counter because the wax never hardens -- it&#x27;s just a stringy and sticky mess. Lastly, I ended up burning myself (ugly scars on my upper-lip that healed after a week) 2-3 times because the wax gets very hot under the top layer, but the top layer doesn&#x27;t appear affected by the heat -- it just stays still -- so I ended up overheating the wax and therefore burning myself.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this to remove hair, obviously. I&#x27;m glad they have a video, because I&#x27;m a total noob when it comes to removing hair except on my face and neck by razor. So that&#x27;s a real plus- they have a long Youtube video that tells you how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on to the product. Smell is very, very mild so you&#x27;re not alerting everyone you&#x27;ve used it. And yes, you can eat it, and it tastes like honey (putting the stick in your mouth is easier than cleaning up the counter). The directions are spot-on, though it could clarify how quickly you should be pulling and other minor details for people new to waxing-type hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;m using it on a pretty sensitive area. I&#x27;m a guy. Do the math. It is indeed very gentle on skin, and putting the product on hot in... those areas... is not a good idea because it causes sweat, which defeats the stickiness of the product. It&#x27;s harder to spread when it&#x27;s not heated, but it&#x27;s better to do &#x27;sweat spots&#x27; without heating it, or I&#x27;m sure you could use the powder suggested in the video they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, fellow noobs, it hurts, but it&#x27;s better than dealing with razor bumps and slicing up the skin. No ingrown hairs either. If you&#x27;re doing sensitive areas, use the smaller strips so you&#x27;re not yanking as much hair and therefore have less pain to deal with at a time until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair removal for my face I have used yet.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.[[ASIN:B0000691JH Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, as a matter of fact I have very little hair in my stomach and a some hair in the chest area...very fine hair, but I never liked it. &lt;br /&gt;I used to shave it with a razor, which was a pain in the butt, because having to shave it every 2 weeks and then I have very sensitive skin, so I had to deal with red skin for days.. &lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy something so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave every 2 days... I bought this MOOM product and it is really good. &lt;br /&gt;It did hurt a bit, but I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything else, so I am not sure what kind of pain I&#x27;d get with other products... although it hurt, it wasn&#x27;t unbearable at all. &lt;br /&gt;It has been like 5 days since I used it and my skin is very smooth, no red spots or any hair... I am so happy that it has been almost 7 days and I see absolutely NO HAIR growing. &lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this product is just for women, hehehehe but it sure worked for a guy. &lt;br /&gt;Plus I really liked that you can wash the cloths and it is not messy at all... &lt;br /&gt;5 stars !</li>
            <li> Easy to use! So much cheaper than going somewhere to get waxed. If you are on the fence, purchase!! It&#x27;s worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> The sugar worked quite well. I have never sugared before and I may very well be a convert but despite all of the high praises for Moom, I think it is a bit overrated. I&#x27;m glad I bought this because I now know how great sugaring is (very easy, practically painless) and I now have some reusable waxing strips. Now the reason for the low score: there was not even enough product for one lower leg (I&#x27;m not exactly beastly hairy), not many waxing strips or tongue depressors provided (trying to get you into buying more of their products) and it is incredibly easy to make. It&#x27;s just sugar, water, lemon juice, lavender and tea tree oils. I was ripped off but at least I now know of a way to wax effectively without going to a pricey salon in this economic climate. My advice: don&#x27;t buy it, make it. There are lots of recipes online. Seriously, read the ingredients list on this. All you really need to buy is some strips, tongue depressors and a jar.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out really horribly, as a result of using this product. I still have bumps. When I emailed Moom Customer Service, they did not respond. In fact, it&#x27;s been more than a week since I contacted them, and I&#x27;m yet to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin problem aside, the product is very messy. It feels like honey, which, as you know, is sticky. And finally, this not does not remove all hair. Even with repeated use, some hair remains, which is very frustrating and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: Customer Support NEVER responded to my email. This predisposes me to think that their \\&quot;money back\\&quot; guarantee is totally bogus.</li>
            <li> What a great surprise. This wax really does wash off! I can reuse the wooden applicators and then just run them under hot water and the remaining wax comes right off. Only reason I gave igt 4 not 5 stars is because I seem to have a problem with applying it correctly or something because it does not pull my eyebrow hair out.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a natural product.  It is very quick to heat up and easy to apply.  It also lasts forever--you only need a thin layer for it to work.  They give you plenty of washable applicators and cloth removers, which I also love.  This product would be 5 stars, but once and a while it misses some of the smaller hairs and has to be reapplied.  But, overall, a great waxing product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove my hair, and doesn&#x27;t go far at all. Then again, I&#x27;ve tried every kind of wax under the sun and none of it removes my hair. (I&#x27;m not doing it wrong. Even the salon ladies can&#x27;t get my hair to come out by the root. There&#x27;s ALWAYS stubble left.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m probably not the &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; wax consumer. So if wax does typically work for you, maybe just consider: This stuff doesn&#x27;t go very far. It&#x27;s probably better/cheaper to just make your own sugar wax at home. That&#x27;s organic and reusable and goes a lot farther. There are youtube videos on it. This stuff just wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money for me, even if it did remove my hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this wax from Moom instead of shaving all the time. It works (even the first time I tried it and didn&#x27;t know what I was doing). I just rip all the hair out! And it&#x27;s not that painful. It even works on underarms pretty well. I figure it&#x27;s worth it because no stubby regrowth. Anyone who is having trouble either is probably using too much wax (then you only pull off the excess wax) or has more resistant hair than I do. I have had a few instances of bleeding from the hair follicle (it was not ripped skin), but I think it&#x27;s because some of the roots were pretty deep. In fact, it just makes me even more impressed that I managed to pull it out! It is recommended that you try to spread it as thin as possible, and don&#x27;t worry, the wax is extremely sticky. I think that&#x27;s also why it hurts less, because it has such a strong hold.    The strips can be washed and reused, and the wax is actually made out of Chamomile, Lemon Water, Tea Tree Oil, Sugar, which is water soluble. It&#x27;s good because warm water will wash it right off your clothes and body, and also because you don&#x27;t have to heat it up to use it. They recommend heating it up, but only so you can spread it more thinly. It is definitely worth it to me. I have waxed pretty much my whole body (arms, legs, underarms, eyebrows) three times and I only used up a third of the wax so far.     I have tried several methods of heating it up: putting the jar in a pot with water on the stove (probably not a good idea to do it without the water!), running hot water over the (closed jar) from the sink, and briefly running the hair dryer over it. All of them worked to loosen up the wax to different degrees, and I only tried the last two because I was too lazy to turn on the stove.     In short, I love this wax and I don&#x27;t think I will ever try anything else. :)</li>
            <li> I got this like most people hoping for an alternative to wax that worked just as well.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t. I used this product on my right leg and I used wax on my left to easily compare the two.  Here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax - removes most of the hair&lt;br /&gt;Moom - removes about half of the hair, and often just breaks it (not unroots it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair, probably medium course-ness and while Moom does pull some of the hair out, it&#x27;s just not as effective as wax and it takes a lot longer.  The 6 oz container is also not enough. You will definitely need 2 of them and you will probably have to use it over multiple days to really get the hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my lower right leg using just a paper thin amount as indicated on the directions. I found it helped to heat it up quite a bit more than the directions indicate (I imagine they are just trying to avoid lawsuits from burns) but really, you need it to be pretty liquidesque to get a nice thin layer. It went much smoother when I started doing this. I ran out of Moom though after doing my right leg (and there was still hair left).  I did my entire left leg with the Sally Hansen wax and had a ton left over (but ran out of the strips that come with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about Moom is that it&#x27;s water soluble so it is very easy to clean up (although a bit messier initially).  I also love the reusable cloth strips which rinse right off with hot water and dry relatively fast for reuse. This part is really a great concept, I just wish it worked better than wax.  It is also slightly less painful than using wax, but I had more redness and irritation with the Moom than I did with the wax.  Regardless, you are pulling large quantities of hair out by the root which is attached to blood vessels and pain receptor cells so you&#x27;re going to experience redness, irritation and pain no matter how you figure it. Honestly, I found it almost painless after a couple drinks.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say you can make this stuff work if you REALLY want to, but you&#x27;re going to have to get a couple of jars or a larger jar of the stuff if you want to do more than one leg.  And you&#x27;ll almost certainly have to go over the same area again to get all of the hair (which is why it takes so much). It appeared to work much better on the course, longer hair and less effective on the finer, shorter hairs as expected.  The wax managed to get most of both.  Although today, my left leg (the waxed leg) is more tender than the right (Moom) leg, but the Moom leg STILL has some hair on it.  I&#x27;ll definitely have to do a follow up wax in a few days to get the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note and tips to first time waxers:&lt;br /&gt;- YES it hurts and yes you will turn red and have irritated skin - with Moom OR Wax&lt;br /&gt;- NO it will not get all the hair at once regardless, even at a professional place - hair grows at different rates and lengths which is why salons will have you come back for a follow up if you&#x27;re a first timer. There&#x27;s usually smaller, finer hairs remaining after a first wax.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure your skin is lotion-free and completely dry before beginning&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure the product is heated hot enough (obviously don&#x27;t burn yourself, but I get it pretty hot). I&#x27;ve found it works much much better when it&#x27;s a more liquid-like consistency and you can spread it on really thin. You do NOT need a lot of the stuff. Be sure to brush on the wax with the hair growth direction and peel back against hair growth - it&#x27;s not a straight up pull where you&#x27;re ripping your skin upward, it&#x27;s more of a fast peel action in the opposite direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t expect to be magically hair free the first time. Also, it takes a LONG time to do this. Particularly with the Moom because they don&#x27;t give you enough strips or Moom stuff to do it all at once. You will probably have to wash the strips, wait for them to dry and then go at it again.  You&#x27;ll want to allow a few days for waxingif you&#x27;re doing it yourself and you&#x27;ve never done it before.&lt;br /&gt;- Pluck strays with tweezers if you missed a few so you don&#x27;t waste wax on it.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with it.&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to exfoliate your skin where you waxed when the hair is about to start coming back in because the skin will grow over the open hair pores and will trap the new growth underneath it and cause really painful, ugly ingrown hairs. Be sure that hair has somewhere to grow out of!&lt;br /&gt;- a few drinks can really help in the pain area (but not so much in the making a mess area) ;)if you&#x27;re doing it yourself and you&#x27;ve never done it before.&lt;br /&gt;- Pluck strays with tweezers if you missed a few so you don&#x27;t waste wax on it.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s much easier if you have someone else doing it for you or helping you with it.&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to exfoliate your skin where you waxed when the hair is about to start coming back in because the skin will grow over the open hair pores and will trap the new growth underneath it and cause really painful, ugly ingrown hairs.

            <li> I really love this stuff! It works perfect for my dark, coarse hair on my bikini area. And an added plus, it hardly hurts!</li>
            <li> I saw Moom sells a men-specific version of this, but, for the price, I figured its really no different so I purchased this one.  It gets the job done, and being that its all-natural, clean-up is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this product works for men too, albeit far from perfectly. It does tend to miss some minor clumps and if you are not careful can be extremely painful. I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that this would be a great product for upkeep but a professional might be the better choice for the initial go due to how much hair men have.    Here are some tips I discovered along the way.  -Do not apply a section wider than the strip you intend to use. I thought it would save time to apply a huge section and take it off in sections. If anything it only made more of a mess and made it harder to properly apply the cloth.  -Use more of a peeling motion, not a ripping motion. The instructions don&#x27;t clarify this, but I found that a swift peel resulted in cleaner results and less pain than just trying to rip the strip off.  -Don&#x27;t be afraid to reheat. You tend to get lazy when it starts to get thick again, but its way easier to spread when warm.  -Do small patches around thick hair, unless of course you like excruciating pain.  -The cloth is washable and reusable. The instructions say this at the very end, but it can be easily missed as I just threw out my original batch of cloth.</li>
            <li> I was all hyped up about using this product and getting rid of my blades. However, the product fell below my expectations. It was very hard getting a clean swipe to remove all the hair on the body surface. So I handed up with patches. Also, when the product melt all the way it doesn&#x27;t work at all. The only way to even get it to almost work is when it&#x27;s hard at least from my experience. I used it once on each under arm but discarded too much work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to really work well at all.  I tried it on my legs (after I let my hair grow out for 2 weeks like it said to do) but only removed some of the hair and not very much of it.  Its worked better on my eye brows I didn&#x27;t turn as red as i do with wax and I didn&#x27;t brake out as much. I&#x27;ll just stick to wax for my legs, it may hurt a little more but at least it works.</li>
            <li> I am one hairy chic!! Im always nervous about ppl starring to hard at my face because I think they are looking at all my hairs on my chin and lip!!! I have been waxing for years...since my mom allowed me and probably snuck to do it before then!! Ive been burnt, ripped and jipped.  This was an amazing experience!! Worked like a dream.  I warmed it in the microwave and was shocked how long it stayed warm!! Wax is messy, but not with moom!! It was easy to clean since its a sugar base!! Ahhhhh the love!! Made my saturday night worth staying in!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great. The least painful of all the wax I have used and produces great results. My husband loves my soft skin opposed to stubles from shaving. If you want to invest your money in a great product this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Now, my mom saw this at a Marshalls and bought it for me because she knew I was unhappy with what I was using. I was switching between Nads and Sally Hansen. I&#x27;m never going back to either of those. I love Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love Moom so much? There is less pain, it smells good, it isn&#x27;t as sticky and it is SUPER easy to clean up. My waxed areas are also never irritated after using it. But really, the best thing about Moom is how easily it comes off your skin and the cloth you use to wax. Oh, and I know I mentioned this, but I have to mention it again. This one is sooo much less painful, especially once you get the hang of it and done it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your room temperature is a little on the warm side, you won&#x27;t have to heat this up. I highly recommend this product- I&#x27;m never going to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I am pretty experienced with all types of hair removal, especially waxing. This product is extremely inefficient, in fact, it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Not sticky at all: I tried different temperatures, and applied different quantities - it didn&#x27;t grab any hair every time. I find this really frustrating given my experience and the other reviews, so my guess is that I was sold an old wax or something...</li>
            <li> What is amazing about this product is that it acts like wax, but you can&#x27;t burn yourself and everything washes off with warm water.  You soak the cloth strips and the stuff just melts away.  You can keep reusing the cloths over and over.  No more picking hard bits of wax connected to hair off your body...Yow!</li>
            <li> I tried many hair removal product at home but Moom is the best so far. It comes with reusable fabric which lasts forever. The product itself is really good. I heated it with microwave, spread on my leg, apply the fabric and DONE! Just like that! It&#x27;s easily be cleaned after you are done and doesn&#x27;t leave any mess, just damp towel with water.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female and I tried Moom last month.  This is a good product, but it may not be for everyone.  I found that after using Moom my hair had returned in two weeks.  I was only able to use the product on one leg, both underarms, and the neck/chin area.  In the starter kit there is not enough Moom or strips to do a really good job on your entire body, especially if you decide that you want to do both legs.  You will need more strips and Moom if you intend to do your entire body at once.  Other then that you must do one section at a time.  For instance you could do your under arms, face, chin and neck with the starter kit.  You would then need to clean up the strips so that you could have enough strips to do another body part.  You will also need more Moom if you intend to do your legs.  Note that this advise may vary.  Women that don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair and don&#x27;t make mistakes with the Moom may be able to Moom more body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reapplied Moom to the neck/chin area several time, but very little hair was removed.  I believe Moom will work for some, but not all, so I wanted to give some tips to first time users so they would have the advantages that I did not.  First time users will need a microwave or some way to warm the Moom; a towel, a bowl with soapy water; a wash cloth; and paper towels.  Do not warm the Moom more than advised.  It would be best to warm the Moom less, because your device that you use to warm the Moom may be more powerful - therefore needing less warming time.  If the Moom is too hot, it will burn you.  Remember as you use the Moom less will be in the jar, so the less Moom in the jar, the shorter the warming time.  The goal is to make Moom easy to spread.  Apply the Moom to the area of your choice in the direction of the hair.  Apply the strip, ensuring that you move your hand across the strip so that it is adhered and pull the strip with a fast motion in the opposite direction.  I did not find I was able to use a strip twice.  Once done you can put the strip in the soapy water.  By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom.  You can rinse the strips and spreaders, then lay them on the towel to dry.  By the next day they should be dry.  If you make a mistake with Moom, even if it is a spill, wet the wash cloth with hot water from the tap, squeeze the extra from the cloth and wipe.  You may have to be a little force with a spill.  If for example you have made a mistake with the Moom on your underarm, use the wash cloth as stated previously with  warm/hot water to wipe away the Moom, then use a paper towel to pat the area dry. Once dry you can reapply the Moom.  Moom does clean up easily. Once you are done with the wash cloth it can be placed in the wash and washed with your regular laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain of ripping away the hair.  I did not trim any areas before I applied the Moom.  And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.twice.  Once done you can put the strip in the soapy water.

            <li> I love this product! This is the first time I tried waxing and this product made the experience unforgettable. It was easy to use. Just remember to follow the instructions and watch the Moom Instructional video in Youtube. I find that it works really well on thick and coarse hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for my brows and upper lip hair which were really thin. The reusable strips are a plus too, since it saves me more money than buying disposable ones every time. I also found out that you really have to apply it paper-thin, because if it&#x27;s anything thicker, it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair. Of course, there is some pain involved, especially when you are removing thicker hairs, but for those areas, I recommend you do it in small sections so that the pain will not be as much every time you pull the strip. Using this product does take practice though, after a while you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Unfortunately, I dropped the jar and the jar broke, spilling all the contents, that&#x27;s why now I&#x27;m going to buy my second one!</li>
            <li> The reviews I read about this product were so overwhelmingly positive that I was skeptical- I mean, how could that be? It&#x27;s WAX, and everyone hates waxing and it always hurts. But I just needed to try it because of bad recent experiences with drugstore kits. Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that not only did this product stand up to it&#x27;s positive reviews, but it was the least painful waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had. I have been using Sally Hansen wax products (which btw stand up to their NEGATIVE reviews...) for the past couple of years, and wasted a lot of time (and pain and skin!) on their products. A few years ago, I also tried the Nads line of sugar based waxes. They don&#x27;t even compare to Moom. This product is water soluble and washes away clean and easily, with lukewarm water. Application is easy, and the strips that are provided are great quality unbleached cotton. The strips also rinse clean incredibly easily.       It is also important to mention how fantastic the instructions are. The English is clear, the procedures are easy, and there are tips to help you have a successful experience (like, try a very light dusting of cornstarch before using). I really appreciate that the company took the time to give instructions for each different area you could use the wax on, as there are small differences which can apparently increase your accuracy. (For example- I would never have known that you don&#x27;t need to heat the wax when using it on your eyebrows.)    I am not the type to take the time to write reviews. But in this case, I just had to. Nice work, Moom, and thanks so much for making this product so affordable as well.</li>
            <li> Before trying Moom, I was using Nads, another natural product. However, I was getting tired of Nads&#x27; very sticky residue, especially since 1. you had to use their special cleaning cloths, and 2. they never included enough in the box!     Moom sounded too good to be true - cloths you clean and reuse? Water soluble product? No skin removal? So, when I tried it today, I was nervous and expecting a horrible foul-up.    To my delight, everything went perfectly! I microwaved the glass jar (lid off) for 10 seconds, which was enough, since it&#x27;s hot today. I dabbed the product on my skin, smoothed it out with the small spreading stick, and adhered the small cloth. Took a deep breath, counted to three, then zipped the strip back, staying as close to the skin as possible.     I was amazed - there was no skin pain, just the slightly sharp sensation of hairs being pulled from their roots. The cloth strip took all the product off with it as well, so there was virtually no clean up! One drop did land on my skin, so I rubbed it off with warm water - NO STICKY RESIDUE!     Plus, the cloths really do rinse clean with warm water, just like advertised.     This product will obviously work differently for every person, but if you read the instructions a few times and get a clear idea of the process in your head before you try it, I truly believe things will go smoothly. No pun intended!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Moom hair removal kit.  I had tried the Parissa before, and while it was okay, my hair grew back quickly. With the Moom, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly at all, and the Moom is much gentler on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, takes the hair away for a long time. Love the fact that it dosent hurt or leave my skin all red. And that its all natural, even better!</li>
            <li> Up until now I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen lavender and sometimes the Brazilian formula for my bikini line. Noticed the great reviews for Moom so I ordered and just tried it this afternoon with very good results. Removing the lid liner the first time was the trickiest part. The Moom really stuck to it and it took a good minute to break it free with my fingers. After that, I popped the Moom in the microwave for a few seconds and it was ready to use. As with any wax there&#x27;s a little sting but I found using less pressure on the cloth strip when applied is key. And cleanup is so easy with Moom! Just use water to wash away unwanted spills etc. And love that the application sticks and cloth strips are reusable -- I didn&#x27;t believe that claim until this afternoon. Everything washed clean and is drying now. I tossed out the rest of my Sally Hansen wax -- I won&#x27;t go back to it after trying Moom.</li>
            <li> I have used it on myself and my teenage daughter on the lip and it works great. It is a little messy until you get used to it, I did heat it up in the microwave to get it easier to spread. Even if you are messy, the clean up is easy with just a wet wash cloth. I would hightly recommend the product</li>
            <li> Doesnt work really well but helps with hair removal.  Probably would be easier to use if you are not using by yourself</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as reviewers stated it will be. It is the best wax I ever used by so far and I tried a lot of them. The waxes I used pulled on skin more than the hair, but not this product. Those other products also smelled bad and they were always impossible to remove unless one has those alcohol wipes to wipe the stuff off. Not this product. Simple soap and water will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this all over except the legs because I don&#x27;t need to. I have almost no hair on the legs, so I use hair removal cream on them. As for the rest of me, I used this. It works really well on the hairs of my arm pits and face. As for coarser hair such as pubs and bikini area, it works so-so. It did took out most of the hair, but not all. Some hairs were broken off as some reviewers stated. I am still really happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I used it is as followed.. I didn&#x27;t wash first as instructed. Instead as I would do my hair coloring I used on dry, unwashed area. This way the hair follicles aren&#x27;t smoothed and silken by the wash and therefore the product grabs the hair more. I was right. The first try I did on unwashed arm pit hairs and did an excellent job, without any pain. Whereas, on washed, cleaned hair, such as my pubs and bikini area, the wax didn&#x27;t grab hold of the hair too well and caused more pain than the dry, uncleaned hair of the arm pits. I highly recommended using this on dry, uncleaned hair for better, less painful experience. I think that is why people are experiencing hair breakage rather than hair being completely pulled off by the roots. I also don&#x27;t recommend using this during a shower. It will not work in humid, steamy rooms. I would use this in my cool, dry room, use the witch hazel to wipe off any excess and then take a bath to wash off all of the residue completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for removing any extra product from the skin, I found out that using Witch Hazel works really well for cleaning off residue off the skin leaving a smooth, unsticky feeling on the skin. Simple wash, also works well, but the witch hazel I found to be less painful to get rid of the extra left overs off the skin quicker. It also relieves and smooths the skin after such a traumatic procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, works really best on dry, uncleaned hair and witch hazel is an awesome sensitive smoother.ooth, unsticky feeling on the skin.

            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews. I received this product today and was anxious to try it on my arms. I heated the \\&quot;wax\\&quot;- it&#x27;s actually sugar- for 20 seconds instead of the 10 seconds. The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; was very sticky but it did work at removing the hair from my arms. I found the strips a little difficult to clean, but it did not take long. I definetly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I usually wax and so I was a bit skeptical when I read the reviews that it hurts less than wax and how easily it washes off!  BOY was I WRONG!!!  This is way better than wax and on my first eyebrow I did it again because again it didn&#x27;t hurt so it surely didn&#x27;t pull any hair out... again I was wrong!  I got it on subscribe and save and will use it forever!</li>
            <li> Tired of paying so much for others to wax my facial hair so i bought this. Package came very nice. Personally, i think you have to get use to this. It does what it says but in the beginning i couldn&#x27;t do it. I guess i need more practice. Overall, it is nice. Buy it &amp; experience it!</li>
            <li> Hi, I wanted to share what I thought was a better way to use this product to get results you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Background: I&#x27;m Middle Eastern originally, and have been using sugar wax most of my life to remove hair, however it&#x27;s always easier when someone does the waxing for you, as when you do it alone it can be very messy. But I was fed up of spending so much money on getting waxed and I decided to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually sugar wax is used at room temperature when you just want to do basic spreading and pulling (it&#x27;s a technique you have to learn through observation, then trial and error).&lt;br /&gt;But I liked Moom&#x27;s idea of using a couple of extra tools ( spreading stick and cloths) to get the job done with less agony. And after a couple of sessions here and there, and much experience generally with sugar wax, I can say this is my favorite way to use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Do not heat the wax in the Microwave as suggested by Moom, for centuries people have used sugar wax at room temperature. And I find this is best...as even when slightly heated it gets too sticky and cannot grab the hair as firmly. When at room temperature the wax can get a firmer grip of the hair without going all over the place in a messy way ( and hence is not as painful when pulling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As opposed to spreading the wax on the hair directly (which I find can be messy and painful sometimes when the hair is slightly long), instead spread a thin layer of the wax on the cloth itself, making sure you have an area relative to that you&#x27;re targeting on your body. So for bikini line, I&#x27;ll spread a thin layer on the cloth, that is long and somewhat wide. I&#x27;ve used the smaller cloths for smaller areas. Note: it&#x27;s more manageable to spread thin layer of wax on the cloth than it is on your body, especially for smaller, more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you put the waxed cloth on the body part your targeting, just tap and rub it a few times gently, making sure its in place, that also slightly warms the wax. Then wait for like 2-3 seconds (gives time for the sugar to settle) and pull with a quick firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s basically my favorite way of using this product, less messiness, less product wasting (for both the sugar and the cloths) and MUCH less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: Btw I only use this for my bikini area (the whole area) and sometimes under arms, for everything else I use an epilator machine.lso slightly warms the wax.

            <li> i have never done waxing by myself at all - but this product was easy on the skin, the wax need only medium warming (no need to really heat), and the wax is easy to wash-off, it comes with cloth-strips that are washable for re-use.    take note though, this wax is most effective on hair that has grown off for some-time, not newly shaved or plucked-off hair.     for this product, i recently used it for eye brows and upper lip (both areas were fine hairs) but the wax was not that effective on the new short hairs that grew on the eyebrows (lol!)</li>
            <li> Just to share awareness that although the product description reads \\&quot;diminishes the pain and eliminates the discomfort of waxing and other methods\\&quot;, you should not be lead to believe that this is a painless operation, and I have high pain tolerance. Ouch, mama-mia!  When you evaluate 1) benefit of not having to shave as often and 2) the smoothness after using  and compare it to the pain you endure while ripping it off, I guess it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Products react differently to people, so maybe my body chemistry just didn&#x27;t agree with this product, but I tried several times to use the product on my legs, but maybe the hair is just to coarse for the product to handle but at any rate it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> this product removes hair without pain and is gentle. I&#x27;ve used a few other brands of hair waxing etc and none of them worked so great. highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all, and this Moom product is the first one that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash or whiteheads to form on my face.  I used harsher waxes for 15 years, and developed melasma from the skin layers they took off over time.  This one is very gentle yet VERY effective and I am super happy with it.  Will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product, but oh well, didn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m fairly familiar with most kinds of hair removal: shaving, waxing, epilating, laser.  With that said, I&#x27;m most familiar with waxing, having done so for the past 15 years, both professionally and at home.  I recently switched to epilating because I just couldn&#x27;t afford monthly waxes anymore, and the mess of doing it at home was enough of a deterrent to me.  However, epilating my thighs hurt so much, I decided to wax them, and just keep epilating my lower legs.    Anyhow, I bought Moom because of the mess-free promise.  I thought \\&quot;this is it, I&#x27;m in heaven\\&quot;.  However, once I got it home, it just didn&#x27;t work properly.  I followed the directions, and I am very experienced with at-home waxing also, and it just wouldn&#x27;t grab all the hairs.  It grabbed about 10 percent of the hairs on any given area.  True, there was no mess, and it hurt less.  But it didn&#x27;t do its primary job, which is ripping those hairs out!  It was so frustrating, I went over the same area three times, and nothing! Tried different strips, and found that the paper disposable ones work better than the cloth ones provided.  But still, now I was getting maybe 15-20% of the hairs.  I got sick of it, got my walgreens-purchased Sally Hansen messy wax, and finished the job--no hair left behind AT ALL.      So, here are a few possibilities why it didn&#x27;t work for me:  1) Moom only works on some kinds of hair.  My hair is thick and black.  2) I was unlucky and got a bad batch  3) Reviews are fake    I usually trust reviews, and most of the time my experience matches those of the majority, so I&#x27;m just baffled and a little sad.  Looks like it&#x27;ll be back to messy sticky waxes for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not using it right or something. I tried on my facial hair and the honey is messy. DO NOT HEAT this in the microwave over 10 seconds. I tried it for 15 minutes and the honey was so hot that I nearly burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it on my face, it took some of the fine hair off but not the really corsed ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again later and get back to you.</li>
            <li> THIs product was a total success for  me!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This was my first time waxing, MOOm is so simple and easy to use that you cant go wrong for buying it. it makes me NEVER want to pick up a razor AGAIN!!!! easy clean up Semi pain free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have course hair and this product will leave hairs behind after you wax an area - a lot of hair. Just go and buy the wax, don&#x27;t bother with this sugaring product. I think the postiive reviews are fake, this is not a good product. I&#x27;d return it but since I opened it and used it, I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried this on recommendation from my daughter in college. Easy to use and clean up. No weird smells. The instructions are easy to follow. It works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this wax! It doesn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs too well (eyebrows), but it gets the majority. I&#x27;ll wax, then take a tweezer to the few left. Besides that, I love that it washes off so well! And the strips are reusable as well as the sticks. I just wash them right after use and dry them for next time. I&#x27;ve used 3 strips about a dozen times and they are still like new. I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural, too. Definitely recommend this for anyone looking for natural waxes. I have to mention that I think real wax would probably work better, but this is great for the price and for what I use it for (face)! Very happy with my purchase ~</li>
            <li> I never waxed my legs before and have only gotten my arms and armpits professionally waxed twice. I read a lot of good reviews about this product so I gave it a try.     Overall, it was very easy to use and more importantly, the clean up was easy too! I really liked how the wax didn&#x27;t get everywhere and how the strips are easily washed and reused.     I waxed my legs, arms, stomach, and armpits. The stomach hair was easiest to remove; the other areas required multiple times to wax off (mainly due to a few hairs that were being stubborn), for those its best to just pluck off.     Overall, I would highly recommend this product, even first time waxers! I feel dumb now for spending so much on getting waxed professionally!</li>
            <li> After reading through many reviews I decided to go ahead and go for it. I watched a YouTube instructional video on how to use the product most effectively (posted by Moom). The only area I planned on waxing was my upper lip, to save the time, money and hassle of going to a salon. I received it yesterday and tried it out last night and it worked great!! I don&#x27;t know why some people had so much trouble with it? I followed all the instructions they gave me and it was pretty simple and not too painful. Let me preface this by also saying that this was my first time ever waxing at home with a DIY kit. I would definitely buy again and recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This kit is not as much effective as a regular wax, but it is SOOOO much nicer to use it! I loved it</li>
            <li> I have NEVER waxed before in my entire life. I didn&#x27;t want to go to a professional because of the horror stories I had heard, so I wanted to try sugaring since I heard you can do it all by yourself. I am amazed that this product works. Just like it says. Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t have any problem. It glides on smoothly and for a newbie to waxing, I did not feel any pain. I rarely write reviews on Amazon even though I shop here all the time, but this product works. Try it!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and was looking for an alternative. After seeing the awesome reviews on here, I had to buy this stuff. As soon as it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a shot and have smooth, hairless legs.    I ended up being disappointed.    The idea of this stuff is great (organic, easy to clean up, less painful), but the stuff itself is ehh.    Now, I&#x27;m NOT an experienced waxer, so that may be part of the reason. However, I watched the video and did it EXACTLY as the directions in the box said, so I&#x27;m positive I was doing it right.    I spent two hours attempting to wax my legs. I used the entire 6oz jar on just the bottom half of each leg, and they are STILL more than 60% covered in hair. It will miss tons of hair. I also have my doubts that this stuff is really pulling it out at the root.    It&#x27;s very difficult to spread. Once you put it on your skin it gums up and only covers a very small area. You&#x27;ll be tempted to just use more on the popsicle stick so you can spread larger areas, but you cant do that because the jar is really tiny, and you&#x27;ll go through it REAL quick. (unless you have the larger jar, but that will probably go quick as well.)    Another annoyance was having to heat it up every 5-10 minutes to make it even the slightest bit spreadable.    The pain wasn&#x27;t bad, just a little sting.    The hair on my legs is pretty fine, and I get the impression that this stuff actually works better on coarse hair.    I will not buy again, but I looked online and this stuff is actually very easy to make yourself with simple household ingredients. (sugar, lemon, honey, water) I will do that next time. That way I can use a more generous amount without trying to be so sparing with this tiny little jar.    My advice---Make it yourself, don&#x27;t buy it. You&#x27;ll be able to make a lot more for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair removal kit I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I am very pleased with the results.  I was drawn to the \\&quot;%100 percent natural\\&quot; ingredients that were listed (Chamomile, Lemon Water, Tea Tree Oil, Sugar). Once I got over my initial fears to waxing or rather \\&quot;moom-ing,\\&quot; I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had imagined. The pain only lasted for a few seconds, and this was absolutely worth the results. My skin felt much smoother, and hair took longer to grow back than with shaving. This method has convinced me to abandon shaving all-together! Another plus is that the strips can be cleaned and reused.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff a week after I ordered it. I was so amazed at this stuff! It smells good, 100% organic, tastes good, (I had some on my fingers and licked it off and it was delicious, but I don&#x27;t eat it by the spoonful lol..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most happy with the muslin cloths, especially since they&#x27;re washable, which means that you don&#x27;t have to throw them away and replace them. Just soak them in hot water for a few minutes, wring them out, and throw them in the dryer. They can last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is extremely sticky and kind of stringy, so be cautious when opening it, otherwise you&#x27;re gonna have a wax mess everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I tried this stuff on my legs first and even though it didn&#x27;t rip all the hair out, it got a good amount. The jar is too small to waste on my legs anyways, so I&#x27;m going to stick to the facial region only, like upper lip and stuff, since the hair is finer. I don&#x27;t mind at all because this means that I am not wasting the wax on my legs. You only need a small amount and it goes a long way, and I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering a couple more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - 100% ORGANIC, Reusable Muslin cloths, convenient wooden spatulas, leaves skin silky smooth, no irritation, can be used warm or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Very very sticky which has the potential to be messy, and not exactly the greatest on courser hair (i.e. leg hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5/5 stars, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but I really liked this product, it is natural and I love the easy to use directions!  I was not a waxer before I always plucked my eyebrows but this by far is much easier and less painful!  The only problem I am having is on bigger areas like the armpits. Not sure if it is my lack of experience or the product.  I would highly recommend this product as it has NO chemicals to deal with.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will not shave bikini area ever again. No more razor bumps. Easy to use. Easy clean up!</li>
            <li> Do not buy... It does not work AT ALL! I have been in the beauty industry for a LONG time and have tried several types of waxing. Thought it would work as well as NADS, was completely wrong. Doesn&#x27;t even take off the fine hairs!!! VERY UNHAPPY!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. After going to places like Walmart and settling for whatever chemical-laden products they have on the shelf, I am thrilled to find this! I searched for something all-natural on Amazon, and this is what came up. After trying it, I can honestly say that this is the least painful product I have ever tried. The sugar mixture and the cloth strips work GREAT together. It&#x27;s super easy to do. (Comes with very clear instructions, too, for beginners.) And I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy more cloth strips, but can actually wash/re-use them! I just get so excited when I find a great all-natural (and organic!) product, I had to come write this review.    PS I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while it has \\&quot;tee tree\\&quot; in it, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. In fact, I could not detect any scent. (When I purchased this Amazon did not offer free shipping on the lavender or rose versions.)</li>
            <li> its ok i just thought it would work better based on the reviews im a little bit disappointed. it takes out hair but not enough in one strip and i&#x27;m not hairy either i have thin hairs on my legs and i had to do it 2-3 times to get all of it out which was pretty painful. lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to waxing. Have used wax, sugar based products, the whole spectrum, this really doesn&#x27;t attach well at all, and you have to do each area 2-3 times before you get the desired results, which means more time, and slightly raw skin.  I switched to Nair&#x27;s milk &amp; honey rollon, which is also water soluble, much better results!</li>
            <li> It works very well on my legs, but not good for under arm.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this product. I had never waxed myself before but after reading the reviews, I felt I had to go for it. I was so glad I did! It was cheaper,more comfortable and certainly less painful than being waxed at a salon.</li>
            <li> I have used wax for years but I wanted to try a product that is less painful. Here&#x27;s what I found about Moom:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is less painful than wax. Great for small sensitive areas like bikini. Cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This product has good ingredients but it&#x27;s really hard to keep it constantly at the right temperature so that it works as supposed to. It&#x27;s bad if you overheat it - you can burn yourself. If it&#x27;s under heated it doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hair. I had to run every 5-10 mins to the kitchen to heat it again. Tried to put it in hot water and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions and it just didn&#x27;t really do anything. I pulled the strip off and almost no hair was removed.</li>
            <li> It has only removed long hair efficiently. It&#x27;s been a week and the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Horrible didn&#x27;t work at all 😞 will never buy any of their products again, please save your money!!!!!! Worst product ever</li>
            <li> Its nicer than regular wax it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad just make sure you read the application instructions before your first usage if you never used the product before its not like your normal wax kit.</li>
            <li> This product is too good...I tried waxing my underarms, as per the instructions, and its better than my palor ... Will surely go for its refill pack s</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this item should come with more strips. You can clean the strips though - I find it easiest to lay them in a shallow bowl of hot water so the wax loosens up, and then rub the wax off to clean them and let them air dry. Wax works well.</li>
            <li> Seeing all the great reviews, I decided to purchase this item. As instructed, I heated in 10 second intervals. Product refused to heat up. After 40 seconds, it was suddenly too hot. It did not take all the hairs in area applied and took several times to get it completely hair free. Only lasted two weeks and then I noticed some ingrown hairs. Definitely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Before using this, I highly recommend watching the how-to video offered by Moom&#x27;s website.  My first attempt was less than satisfactory.  I heated the product over the stove and had an issue getting everything to the right consistency.  There seems to be a stubborn blob that refuses to thin out like the rest of the mixture.  I ended up dipping the applicator sticks to the bottom and swirling the liquid from the bottom on top and using that instead.  It works great and barely hurts :-).  Prior to this, I&#x27;ve only used epilators so my pain tolerance might be slightly higher than someone with no experience with depilation.</li>
            <li> I just used this kit for the first time to wax my upper lip and eyebrows and I am totally sold on it.  I had been buying cheaper products regularly (the Sally Hansen hair remover wax strip kit or microwavable facial wax), but I&#x27;m really glad that I decided to spend more and try something new.  This worked great on my (south asian, thick, dark) hair and had lots of benefits over these other products, including that it dissolves with just water, so you aren&#x27;t left with sticky stuff all over your face, it left my face feeling soft and with no red spots, and it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> I tried sally hansen brazilian wax to begin with my first time waxing my bikini BIG mistake. It hurt so bad I had to slowly peel the wax off one hair at a time it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all. I then tried the sally hansen al over body wax because it had the strips, which I thought would be more comfortable...better than the brazilian but once again I couldn&#x27;t get past 2 pulls before I quit. I bought moom because I was at a beauty store and it was on sale I said let me just give this a try ! I picked up the jar because it was on sale but I didn&#x27;t feel like wasting that much money again so I bought the pre waxed strips because it said it was good for beginners. I used 5 of the 10 wax strips and they were filled with hair. I wasn&#x27;t able to get much hair off though, I think the strips are good only for the bikini line, underarm, or facial hair but the pain was definetly durable compared to Sally Hansen. I have never went to a salon so I can&#x27;t compare that pain but I did my bikini line and I wish it wasn&#x27;t so late because I would head to the store right now and pick up the jar so I could finish the skin is smooth and with no irritation, minimal bleeding, but that was expected. I used the oil provided after and all of the wax was gone AMAZING ! I still have wax on my microwave from the Sally Hansen wax I can&#x27;t even get off. I can&#x27;t wait to finish this product is AMAZINNGG  !!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is natural and gentle on skin. I also liked that it wipes off with cold water, as opposed to oil-based removers required with conventional wax. I&#x27;m sure that this product&#x27;s efficacy varies from person to person depending on method of use, as well as skin and hair type, but for me it worked just fine. It was easy to use and clean up. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin as red as wax. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this product for six months, and used it about six times on my eyebrows.  Each time there are a good amount of hairs left over that I have to pluck.  I follow the instructions to a &#x27;t&#x27;, and have tried every which way to get it to work (leaving the strip on longer, using more, using less, re-doing it, rubbing the strip harder, softer, etc.,) and it DOES get rid of some hair, but definitely not all of them.  The results also don&#x27;t last long - two weeks max and they&#x27;re all grown back.  Maybe it&#x27;s b/c I have fine hair, but I&#x27;m hugely disappointed.  It&#x27;s also kinda messy to apply (&#x27;strings&#x27; everywhere), but cleanup is easy enough.</li>
            <li> I usually get my brows done at my sisters salon, but I decided to buy my own so I could wax my legs. Its much less painful than going to a salon and it gets cleaned up easily. The wax strips and sticks run out faster than the wax, but you can get those anywhere relatively cheap. It doesn&#x27;t work too well on my upper lip though, I find that it doesn&#x27;t catch as much hair, maybe the hair is too short? Also I find it easier to apply if you heat it in the microwave for 15 or so seconds.</li>
            <li> The good reviews are all fake. I&#x27;ve used it 5 times on different areas and it only takes off a few hairs. Only positive is it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li> I have tried epilating, waxing, nair, no!no! and all of the likes. I&#x27;ve even made my own sugar wax at home (which worked great the first batch but ripped off a layer of skin with the second batch).. I have got to say this is the best type of hair removal I have ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to a T -- a very very very paper thin layer of the wax should be used (that&#x27;s all you need!). It should be heated 10-15 seconds MAX. It&#x27;s not supposed to be hot or runny. The hair removing was almost pain-free (especially compared to other methods). I&#x27;ve only just tried this 3 nights ago so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take the hair to grow back. But as far as effectiveness - not a single hair was missed for me. And I&#x27;m no professional at waxing techniques - I go through way too many muslin strips. It&#x27;s pretty convenient that you can just wash the wax off and reuse them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the container was larger though. 6 ounces does not seem like a lot. I&#x27;ll probably be able to wax my legs and bikini area about 4-5 times. Which isn&#x27;t terrible for $12. I&#x27;ll definitely be a returning customer for this</li>
            <li> I was super excited to recieve this in the mail because I had read so many rave reviews. Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work on me at all.  It barely removed any hairs, probably only 5% of them.  I followed directions very closely but I still have hairy legs.  It was easy to clean up and easy to clean the cloths strips that it came with but this product failed in removing hair, which is it&#x27;s main purpose! :[</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried all sorts of products for hair removal, but all of them had their flaws. I figured Moom would be no different, but decided to buy it because I was looking for a natural product and there were such great reviews (no pain, easy clean-up, etc.). I&#x27;ve used microwaveable body wax (sticky and complicated to get ready), naturally bare honey wax (natural, but extremely sticky/messy and hard to grasp the clear strips), wax strips (easy to use, but more wasteful than I&#x27;d like) and cream/gel hair removers (also gross).     I ordered Moom shortly after I&#x27;d waxed, but when I got it a week later I was anxious to try it. Moom was super easy-to-use--similar to the honey wax, but much less messy (even when I heated it). The fabric strips were easy to grab and there are plenty of them. On my face, Moom picked up shorter hairs my wax had missed or broken off. I love that it is sensitive enough for my face, but it&#x27;s strong enough to use on the rest of my body. I didn&#x27;t even have to hold my breath using Moom on my bikini line (though I did have to go over some sections a couple of times either because the hair was so coarse or maybe because I&#x27;m still getting used to the correct way to spread Moom). There is a bit of a sting, but it doesn&#x27;t linger like the hard wax does and the skin is smooth right away, with the redness disappearing quickly.    It was so much less painful than hard wax, easier to use than the honey wax, and more precise than the pre-made wax strips. And the clean-up was so easy. I love that the strips are reusable, and that the residue washed off easily off of my skin and the strips. I won&#x27;t lie--I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great as all of the reviews had set it out to be, but all I could do was say \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; I&#x27;ll be tossing my honey wax and my tub of microwaveable wax now.</li>
            <li> I used another wax product from Sally Hansen and returned it because of the sticky mess it made everywhere. I was so glad to find Moom. It lives up to its great reviews. Cleans up easily and completely natural. I only wish I could find Moom products at local stores (Target, CVS, Walgreens) but I haven&#x27;t found it yet so until then, I&#x27;m buying through Amazon.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good; it&#x27;s true that it does not give a chemical burn like some others but i have to go over spots many times before hair is almost completely removed.  it is worth a try and a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Did not like this wax at all.  Didnt spread smoothly when heated and didnt remove anywhere near all hair.  Had to do more than one pass over each section and that is just painful.</li>
            <li> I want to love this product.. it smells great, easy to use, easy clean up, organic and reusable strips. But it just doesn&#x27;t compare to a wax (like sally hansen spa body wax, lavender). I waited for a week for hair to grow out and this product just doesn&#x27;t take off all the hair, even when passing over an area numerous times 50% of the hair is still there. With all the good reviews here I assume this is because I am not letting it grow long enough, but I just can&#x27;t go several weeks with hairy legs waiting for the hair to get long enough to remove (not sure how long that would take). I would give this less stars but I really like it (even without it working if that makes sense :/). It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all like wax, probably because it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of grip. If your not careful with wax you could also pull off skin along with hair. And the clean up is a breeze compared to wax, this product can be rinsed off with water... unlike wax that you practically have to scrub off with oil. But its just not as effective as wax... with wax practically as soon as you see hair, you can wax it off and don&#x27;t have to go over and over an area. Although I love the idea of this product... I just don&#x27;t think it will work for me. I don&#x27;t want to wait weeks to remove the hair, I could barely stand the one week. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update July, 25, 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this another try, waiting about 2 weeks this time. It is definitely more effective with longer hair but still did not get all of the hair, even with more then one attempt. My hair is different lengths and some wasn&#x27;t long enough. I would say this time it got about 70% of the hair... so I would either have to shave to get smooth skin now or wait for the other hair to grow out and try again... I think I will wait and try again since I&#x27;ve waited this long. I&#x27;m leaving the same star rating because the wait for smooth skin with this product is a bit agonizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update August, 4, 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this again... removed the longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in. I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price. I have used about 3.longer hair but still don&#x27;t have soft legs as there are shorter hairs coming in. I have purchased 5 of these kits now because I can&#x27;t find just the refill jar at a reasonable price. I have used about 3.</li>
            <li> While I really like this--doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing, all natural, reusable cloth strips--there are some cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt; - If you get the MOOM mixture too hot, it hurts, but if it is too cold, it won&#x27;t spread.&lt;br /&gt;- VERY sticky&lt;br /&gt;- Cloth strips are hard to clean and not very thick&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pull a lot of hair out, takes practice to be able to use correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- All natural&lt;br /&gt;- Came with everything needed&lt;br /&gt;- Once you get the hang of it, it works well&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to take the time and effort to learn how to use this, it is a great alternative to waxing or shaving. I love that it is all natural, and that everything needed is included, and the price is fantastic, but it does take a while to learn how to use correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While difficult, it is a nice product. It&#x27;s not exactly a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, it make work for you or you may prefer shaving and waxing once you&#x27;ve tried it. But it is definitely interesting and I think you should try it before deciding you hate it--that was my first reaction, until I made myself try it a few more times. Now I like it. :)</li>
            <li> First, for everyone complaining about the amount of product, please note that they also sell this in a 12 oz. size (which is the one I actually bought).  With that said, I can say that I just used this for my second facial hair removal session (upper lip and chin), and I think I like it quite a bit.  My first time using it, I found that I was spreading it TOO thin, and it wasn&#x27;t working at all at first.  That&#x27;s when, determined, I went online to watch the instructional video, and saw that I should maybe use a bit more MOOM than the barely visible layer I has been applying.  This did the trick, and I started to see some hairs coming out.  You definitely do have to go over most areas more than once, especially if your hairs grow in pretty random directions and not in much of a \\&quot;pattern\\&quot; like mine.  It&#x27;s very specific to the direction of your growth, if that makes any sense, more so than regular wax. I was disappointed to find out after my first session that I still ended up with the unsightly whiteheads the next day (and of course a few more in the days to follow).  So I hit the internet up and came across a recipe for homemade Tend Skin - just search for it and you can make some too.  I used it on my existing zits and they seemed to go away faster and I didn&#x27;t see any new ones.  I also came across some other promising things I could try my next time MOOMing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this most recent session, I washed my face in warm water (to loosen up the pores and their grip on the hairs) and mild Dove soap first.  I swabbed the area with a little alcohol first, and when this dried, applied a light dusting of powder so the MOOM would stick better. And when I used the MOOM, I applied AGAINST the hair growth (and rubbed on the cloth strip against the growth), and removed in the SAME direction as growth.  Some websites I had visited stated that this was the correct way to do sugaring, and MOOM is really just a form of sugaring.  I found that it removed the hair as well or betterthan last time, and it felt slightly gentler and less painful this way.  I did small patches at time, also trying to let areas rest a bit before going back over them.  After MOOMing, I washed the area again with COLD water (to close those infection-prone pores) and the same mild soap, dried the area, and applied the home-made Tend Skin solution (really just crushed up Asprin, witch hazel and alcohol).  I am also planning on not touching the area at all, as I know this can contribute to pimples.  It looks great this time, with minimal redness and almost no stray hairs, and feels clean and cool.  I will keep my fingers crossed that no whiteheads come in - I have a good feeling about it though, I have to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it goes without saying that the cleanup with this stuff is waaaay easier than with wax, since it is water soluble.  As everyone knows, no hair removal method is perfect (there is always a \\&quot;catch\\&quot;) , but I am thinking that MOOM might be the lesser of the evils that I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! I&#x27;ve changed my rating from 4 to 2 stars. I thought I owed it to people to mention that I no longer use this stuff. I DID end up breaking out in whiteheads on my face, just as I had with regular hot wax.  This, along with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t remove hair quite as well as hot wax does, made this product a big disappointment for me.  I&#x27;m back to depilatory cream for my upper lip, as it is the least disagreeable option I have tried. The cream I&#x27;m currently using doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair like I wish it would, but at least it doesn&#x27;t burn me like some have - I end up having to pluck a few stragglers, which kind of sucks, but it is the best option I&#x27;ve found. Laser hair removal has piqued my interest as of late, but that is another can of worms altogether...</li>
            <li> All the good things written about this product were true for me.  I have some tough facial fur and was introduced to waxing quite late in life.  When your close-up vision is going you don&#x27;t want to be spreading heavy wax around your eyes!  Wax also used to leave my skin red and irritated for hours, even when done by a professional.    I thought this product might be too messy, and not strong enough for me, but was wrong on both counts.  The instructions say not to warm it for the face, but you can still spread it fairly thin.  It&#x27;s painless and gets ALL the hair.  I simply rinse the cloth strips and the applicators out in the sink after rinsing my skin.    Moom does not irritate my skin at all.  In fact it leaves my face silky smooth and very soft, and I&#x27;m already finding the grow-back time to be lengthening.  You really can&#x27;t make a mistake with this product.  At least not one that  a little warm water can&#x27;t take care of!    It&#x27;s inexpensive too.  I expect this small jar will last me a very long time.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Okay lets face it, when you pull hair out by the roots it&#x27;s gonna hurt. But, that was a welcomed relief to the pain of my hair getting pulled at when the gel was being applied.  I admit I probably overstepped the boundaries of the product by having my wife do my back hair.  The instructions don&#x27;t even address this part of the body.  All that said........... yes it really, really works.  As soon as she got the hang of it, it went like clockwork. (I believe she actually enjoyed it, giving me pain that is)  &lt;br /&gt;  I know Moom makes a mens gel, but the main ingredients are the same, plus my wife plans on using it too.  Maybe I&#x27;ll buy a men&#x27;s refill and see if it goes on a little smoother ( yes I did heat it up)  &lt;br /&gt;  So guys.......... need to get rid of that unwanted back and lower neck hair look no further, this stuff really works and beats paying $450 at a hair removal place. I used half of the 6oz container for a back I would consider semi-hairy.  &lt;br /&gt;Buy a few refills, at $9 they&#x27;re a steal. I found the men&#x27;s 12 oz refill at drugstore (dot) com  if you want to try that. Have whomever is doing it read and UNDERSTAND all the directions before they start, and remember if it doesn&#x27;t hurt they&#x27;re not doing it right.</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c it costs 1/3 of what I would pay to have my local salon wax my chest.  I learned that I would probably have been better off leaving it to a professional, being that this was the first time I&#x27;ve waxed and I ended up leaving (and just shaving) a few stray hairs.  Maybe a set of friendly helping hands would have worked, too.  It&#x27;s sticky, so get ready to wash your hands a lot.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> great product and received it in a timely manner. Would suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> First time waxing at home, I bought this as my skin is very sensitive and it had the tea tree oil and was completely organic. Went on smooth, love the reusable fabric strips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past five years, and I refuse to try anything else because of how amazing it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I usually microwave this product in increments of 10 seconds until it has a honey-like consistency. The wax is actually unusable at room temperature because it solidifies, so I have to heat it up a little bit for it to become viscous. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this for at-home Brazilian wax and it&#x27;s so not painful at all, and it grabs all the hair. Despite being made of sugar, the wax doesn&#x27;t make my skin all gooey afterwards, and I can just rinse off with water. It is very easy to use as well. Just hold the skin you want to wax taut with one hand. Spread wax over the area. Lay the muslin strip on the waxed area. Wait a few seconds and then rip off the strip quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried shaving, using depilatories, and other wax products, and none of them compare to this one. I wish I just started with this because it would have saved me money if I didn&#x27;t have to experiment with the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that the strips are reusable - you just need to soak them in water and then leave them out to dry. A jar of this product probably lasts me about four months. They&#x27;ve raised the price on this product since I first bought it, but I think it&#x27;s still worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I read that using baby powder helps the wax adhere better but it actually didn&#x27;t work for me. I just use the product as is. Just be sure that your skin is dry or the wax will not adhere to your hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a side note, in my college student days, I also sometimes used this as pore strips and it removed a lot of gunk from my face as well. The ingredients didn&#x27;t have a harmful effect on my face, but I would patch test if you decide to do this.</li>
            <li> I totally fall in love with this Wax product, it&#x27;s awesome and it&#x27;s so easy to use, all you need is place  the jar into the oven for 10 second, then apply on your skin and wax!!!! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Impressed!  The product was easy to use, it cleaned up easy, didn&#x27;t pull off any of my skin, and hurt surprisingly less than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;It worked amazing for my eyebrows but had a harder time clinging to the small fine hairs on my upper lip.  Could just be me thought.  After using Moom I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go back to waxing.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading so many great reviews, however my experience was anything but great. I should have known it was going to be bad when I couldn&#x27;t get the seal off because it had stuck to the sugar. when I heated it up, it constantly went on way too thick and cooled faster than I could even spread it around. When I put the strips on, they never took all the moom or all the hair off. And it hurt like hell. My skin was raw, red, bumpy, and irritated. It also took over an hour, and the majority of the jar, to do one lower leg because I kept on having to stop and reheat it in the microwave. I could only do half of the other lower leg with what was left in the jar. This was horrible and I know now that I shouldn&#x27;t trust all the good reviews I read on here.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this product. Like most people, I get sick of shaving pretty quickly and decided to use this as an alternative to straight up waxing, which I have had bad experiences with.&lt;br /&gt;To get this out of the way, regardless of the reviews I read, I was expecting it to be messy, to hurt, and to not do the entire job. However I expected a heck of a lot more than what I actually got.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to a T. First off, heating it only ten seconds did not do a thing to it, it was a terrible mess. When heated up for about 30 seconds it got to a workable consistency. I tried it on my face, stomach, and bikini area just like the directions said by applying a very thin layer, rubbing over the strip, then pulling. I found it worked a little bit better if I waited for about a minute before removing the strip.&lt;br /&gt;It got none of the fuzz on my face, which I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about because they are pretty fine. Next I tried my bikini area. It hurt like hell. It pulled out maybe half of the hairs, some other hairs simply snapped, and it left a massive mess and I was even bleeding. Not to mention my skin got extremely red and the next day I had red spots everywhere the hair did come out and the area was painful to the touch. Finally I decided to give it another try on my stomach, an area with hairs easier to pick up than my face but less sensitive than my bikini area. The same thing happened. This time it got maybe 1/4 of the hair and left me messy and bleeding. I can only even tell that I used the stuff because where I used it is all red.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s too sensitive to use products like Nair. However this stuff was equally as bad. The pain and mess were certainly not worth the few hairs that it managed to pull out.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed before - the whole idea sounded too intimidating, especially after hearing tales of ingrown hairs and damage to the skin.  So, I was nervous the first time I used MOOM, but the experience was really good!  I have extremely coarse hair and was doubtful that mere sugar and lemon juice could actually work, but it did!  The pain was minimal, and everything washed up with warm water. I would recommend growing the underarm hair to at least 1/2 inch before attempting underarms.  Also, the instructions say to be careful not overheat - this is important!  I heated in the microwave longer than the instructions advised and burned a part of my leg. Overall, I am really happy with MOOM :-)</li>
            <li> Painful removal like any wax, but my skin (which is sensitive) recovered well with it. Didn&#x27;t have to deal with ingrown, though it missed the shorter hairs, again like any wax type. It&#x27;s water soluble so clean up is easy, even if you chicken out. If you have sensitive skin, this is a good choice, though if you have a low pain tolerance this is slightly better than wax choices, still get a numbing creme too.</li>
            <li> People weren&#x27;t kidding about the pain. Probably not ideal for coarse hair types. I also didn&#x27;t like how quickly the wax cooled down, by time I was ready it was already turning white. I tried to like this multiple times, but after about 30 bloody pores later (from more than one use, I&#x27;m not suicidal) I gave up. I&#x27;m back to the razor with hair conditioner routine.</li>
            <li> I have waxed quite a bit before.  I have gotten it professionally done but I mostly do it myself.  This was the most ineffective kind of wax I&#x27;ve used.  I tried it on my legs and it only pulled out a few hairs.  I am Asian so I don&#x27;t really have that much body hair to remove and the hairs that I do have are extremely fine.  Perhaps if you have thicker hair, it will work.  If you have Asian or fine hair, you will most likely have the same results that I did.</li>
            <li> For a girl who has dealt with semi-sensitive skin all my life, this product was fantastic. Not only did it deliver effective results on \\&quot;all\\&quot; areas of my body, but once I got the hang of using the product, my skin was left smooth, hairless, and pain free. The only wish I had for this product is that there were more application cloths included. Overall though, great product and one that I am happy to have added to my subscription list. This product is even a more cost effective choice for me as well! Good luck to all those who use this and may your results be loved!</li>
            <li> Soft, works, heat up just a tad or put container in warm water.  Definitely recommend for smooth and easy waxing</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time. I was very happy with the results.     -removes coarse leg hair  -gentle on the skin  -washable **** (the key)</li>
            <li> I just used this for waxing my bikini line.  I&#x27;m new to waxing that area and I&#x27;m completely new to this kind of wax (I normally use wax strips for my upper lip).    *Pain: When it comes to ripping your hair out, stinging is what I typically expect.  But this stuff doesn&#x27;t really burn or sting when you rip it off; it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a pressure as you pull it off your skin. On a relative scale, tweezing, getting your blood drawn, pulling a Band-Aid off your arm, and those horrible Sally Hansen wax strips definitely hurt more than this.  For some reason, I was terrified every time I was about to pull a strip off, but it was always underwhelming.      *Effectiveness: It works provided you apply it properly.  If you put it on too thick, it&#x27;s not going to work.  You&#x27;ve got to spread it out super thin (basically scrape the stuff off in the direction of the hair growth, leaving a very thin layer).  It sometimes does leave a few stray hairs here and there, but it&#x27;s no big deal -- just reapply (since it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, this isn&#x27;t a problem) or tweeze them out.  I&#x27;d say it removes ~90% of the hair where you apply it.  Rubbing on a little baby powder before applying can help.    *Messiness: Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of messy and can be kind of stringy, but it cleans up very easily with just warm water.      ***Tips: I cannot emphasize this enough: WATCH THE MOOM INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO ON YOUTUBE.  Even if you&#x27;ve been waxing for years, just watch it to make sure you know how to apply it.  Also, apply it in small areas (e.g. 1 by 1.5 inches) because it&#x27;s easier to rip out a few hairs at a time than a million hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my legs waxed twice. The second time was so painful - so awfully, torturously painful - that I swore I&#x27;d never do it again. When I first saw the Moom kit I figured there was no way it would work, and if it did there&#x27;d be no way it was less painful than waxing. I was wrong about both. It works AND it hurts WAY less than waxing. I followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t wait until my hair was 1/2 inch - mine was about 1/4 when I tried it. It wasn&#x27;t hard to spread and I got the hang of it quickly. I made sure to warm the jar up as soon as I saw it thickening again.    I&#x27;m sad that there only seems to be enough strips of fabric to do one leg before washing them. After one leg, half the jar is gone but it&#x27;s still a bargain compared to going to a salon. I&#x27;m sure you can use some strips of natural undyed cotton in addition to the ones they give you, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and so does my sister and my mother. I waxed my moms legs and her underarms. She loved the results. She said it didnt hurt. Before she was using Sallys waxing kit and it wasnt as great as moom. I am in love with this product and I definitely recommend this to other women.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  It&#x27;s a great alternative than using one&#x27;s gas to drive to a beautician to do the job that will charge around the same price for this product for one visit.  To me, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product! I have tried waxing once or twice in my life and I have used those store plastic strips by Sally Hanson (or whatever that brand is). OMG, when I would use those it would hurt so bad I would be crying, bleeding, and traumatized. Yeah, I said it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so amazing, easy, and less painful. It just grabs the hair instead of your skin, unlike the store brands. I mean, you will still get pain, but it&#x27;s bearable. And it&#x27;s amazing how this stuff washes off and you can keep going. With other waxing products, they tell you that you can&#x27;t re wax what you have already done and to just tweeze what you missed. Annoying. With this, because it doesn&#x27;t wax your skin, you can jump in the shower really quick if you get a little goopy( because this stuff doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin), wash off, pat dry and have another go. AMAZING! AND you can reuse the strips by just washing them off! I couldn&#x27;t believe that. I just jumped in the shower after I was done waxing, with the strips, and just watched the stuff start to dissolve in the shower. I LOVE LOVE this stuff and I will absolutely never use anything else ever again. I can now wax all my areas, and not have to do it all the time and wear a bathing suit without feeling self conscious. Thank you Moom for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have tried this  afew times and followed the directions. I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair. I tried it on my face, neck, bikini area, and legs. It worked ok on my face and my legs. It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else. I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time. The only plus for this product is it did not bother my skin so I will try again.&lt;br /&gt;Tryied again and it did not work I only got a few hairs off and red skin:(</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because it is organic. I feel like anything organic, is better than those synthetic stuff. I watched a few youtube videos and tried it on myself (underarms and brazilian) - and it does the job well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the directions state to microwave it first (but it gets toooo hot for me).. so i never microwaved mine anymore, and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I bought a box of tongue depressors here on amazon (really cheap for 500 in a box), and i find them to be a better applicator than the skinny sticks...</li>
            <li> Best wax iv every had even better then the 45 dollar ones I get at the salon. At least for me it was less pain as long as i kept it at a nice \\&quot;honey\\&quot; consistency. Although I wish I would have ordered more then just 6 oz and more strips just not enough for my hairy legs. For me waxing lasts about 2 weeks tops so if this makes it longer then even a week and a half its worth the money already.</li>
            <li> Moom is a great product, have used it for years and love it.  My issue is with the large fabric strips in the kit I received from Vitacost.  Normally the fabric for the large and small strips is of a lightweight muslin; however, in the kit I received, the large strips are of a heavier weight muslin.  When I used them, I had considerable bruising which I&#x27;ve never had with the lightweight strips. I spoke with the Moom company directly and they said that they still use the same fabric for both the large and small strips.  To verify this, they also suggested I check out some of their kits at a local retail store.  I did and found that to be true.  Vitacost claims they don&#x27;t know how this could be.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t discover this problem while it was still within the guarantee time frame so I have no recourse.</li>
            <li> I have used all different types of at-home waxing kits.  I&#x27;ve used Veet wax strips, Sally Hansen, Nad&#x27;s, and even Avon. None of them have worked as well as Moom. If you read the instructions carefully, and follow what they say, this product removes hair the fastest and most thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get a tad sticky, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with it getting everywhere.  Use a thin layer, like the instructions state, and apply in the direction of the hair growth in small sections and viola - hair gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the fact that it washes right off with warm water, the cloth strips are re-usable, and this product seems to last for a really long time.  I use it for my upper lip, my under-arms, and my legs.  I&#x27;m still leaving my bikini waxes to the professionals.</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s organic but it&#x27;s not actually a very good wax.  I had to go over the same spot multiple times and still had hair leftover.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It was good in removing the hair and did not need to be repeated to clean up the skin. I also liked the tissue and other stuffs coming with it. However, this size was really small, I could not epilate my whole leg with it and it finished at the middle of my epilation. I think I would get bigger sizes next time.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a guy.  I have very thick and coarse hair.  I am not a metro type of guy, but I do take care of myself.  Main reason being for comfort, not looks.  I have my back waxed by a professional, which makes me much more comfortable in a uniform shirt on a hot day.  However, I also wear work shoes all day and so I wax the hair off of my feet every once in a while.  When you are wearing work shoes and uniforms for a good portion of your day, every little bit helps.  I used to use Nad&#x27;s for my feet, and never had any real issue with it, but I was just looking to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, even though I am very skeptical about the hype of products online.  I have to admit it actually works very well.  I prefer it to the Nad&#x27;s product for my personal use and hair type.  It is gentle.  It works great and it seems like it grabs all the hair in one pull so I don&#x27;t have to go back and catch the little stray ones as much.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to waste and I appreciate a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  Now I have comfortable feet and I can say that I believe this is an excellent product, and I have recommended it to friends that have issues with some of the other types of hair removers.  Hope this helps someone out there. Especially any men that are hesitant to ask or admit that they would like to try something like this.  It&#x27;s not 100% pain free, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked great, came fast. Will use this product and brand again. Easy, and smell is good.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes some practice, but it works as expected. Not perfect, but with practice you can get pretty close</li>
            <li> Messy and completely ineffective. It did not remove a single hair. I am going back to Nair. It least that works.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had waxed my legs.  I done alot of research trying to figure out what was best to use,and it was all the reveiws I had read here on Amazon,that made me choose Moom.  I didn&#x27;t care much for having to let my hair grow out so long,but I figured you had to do that with any wax.  The pain wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.  But boy was this stuff messy.  But I must say,it did the trick.  After 2 weeks of doing it,I just had a few hairs here and there popping up. &lt;br /&gt;Over all good stuff,but messy.</li>
            <li> I just tried Moom for the first time and I have to say, I loved it! I&#x27;ve been looking for a better way to deal with upper lip hair for a while. This worked so well, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use from now on!  The great part about it is that, since it&#x27;s sugar, it washes off anything simply with warm water.  I actually followed the instructions of a reviewer and didn&#x27;t heat up the wax , but spread it on the strip itself and then applies the strip to my upper lip. I then patted down the strip, held my skin taut, and pulled in the opposite direction of growth. Simple and effective!</li>
            <li> This is the same as the hot wax and strips that Everyone offers.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews for products I buy. Not because I don&#x27;t like the products, but because it&#x27;s a pain. But this product so exceeded my expectations that I decided to take the time to review it. I was spending $10 a week on my chin area, $5 every 2 weeks on my upper lip area and $10 every 2 weeks on my eyebrows (although I&#x27;d recommend caution on your eyebrows-practice using it for a while then do the eyebrows very carefully) That was a total of $70 per month on waxing! And it always hurt! Moom is not only saving me a bundle-I&#x27;ve used it approx 6 times on myself and once on my daughter since I purchased it-I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any at all-the jar still looks full. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and works wonderfully well to get all the hairs out. I also love that if I get it in a spot I didn&#x27;t want to, I can just remove the product with water-unlike wax which you are stuck with once placed. I bought another kit the other day for my daughter-after seeing how well it works and how much it&#x27;ll save on salon waxing-she wanted one also. I saw a hint somewhere to use coffee filters instead of the cloths that come with the kit-I like that idea because the cloths, while washable, are a bit stiff after hand washing and somewhat of a pain to keep washing them. So today I tried the unbleached coffee filters cut to size-they worked perfectly and best of all are disposable.....A pack of those will last a long while. I&#x27;m going to try it on my legs in the near future since shaving my legs leaves stubble and has to be done every single day. So, if you are debating on purchasing this kit-buy it-don&#x27;t keep paying some else to do the simple job of waxing-it&#x27;s easy to do it yourself and a ton cheaper.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is well worth the money. It worked great on my lip, a little tricky on the eyebrows but probably cause the hairs aren&#x27;t as long so they&#x27;re harder to grab. Use it once and it pays for itself if you normally pay to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews and because it is natural.I opened the instructions and read them, and used the product exactly as directed. It takes like three applications to get the hair to come off and it doesnt do it thoroughly. It&#x27;s messy, sticky and it doesnt work very well.   Save your money and buy a wax heater and wax, not this crap.</li>
            <li> This is just awesome! I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have never, ever waxed before, not at home and not at a salon. I got the wax for one thing and one thing only--the wax that makes women&#x27;s knees tremble--the Brazilian. Oddly enough, I wasn&#x27;t nervous, especially because I knew this comes right off with water (quite easily, actually--just wet a washcloth and rub it over the sticky area and it comes right off. If you do it carefully, warming the wax to the right consistency, working in approximately 1x1 squares and pulling with confidence, it&#x27;s totally great!    Just a few tips: the hair really does need to be on the longer side. I tried it on a patch where the hair was under 1/4 inch, thinking \\&quot;ah what the hell?\\&quot; and only about half of the hair came out.   I love that this stuff is non-toxic, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about inhaling its smell or letting it near my coochie.     Now, for the part most people probably want to hear about....THE PAIN IS NOT BAD--IT&#x27;S ABOUT THE SAME AS RIPPING OF A BAND-AID!! That&#x27;s actually how I would describe it. Granted, my hair is not extraordinarily thick (i&#x27;m eastern european) or coarse, but the pain was nothing like the excruciating horror stories I heard--all you have to do is follow directions!    I&#x27;ve also used barely any of it...it&#x27;ll last forever, especially because the wax comes off the strips when soaked in water, so they&#x27;re reusable. All in all, I really really couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this several times, same results - NONE.  I did everything the instructions said and just ended up with a mess of wax on myself.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> ANYONE who had a problem is crazy. Best ever, yes a bit messy but washes off easily. Almost not pain at all. Put on thinly and you&#x27;re golden! I&#x27;ll never pay for waxing again...just did bikini area for a patch test, gonna try and tackle a full Brazilian ASAP! A must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every DIY wax out there...from the big melting pot type to the drug store brands. I recently became a mom again just as my only child was off to high school..(surprise) of course I always like saving money, but my biggest problem was getting to the salon to get my eyebrows done...I try to sit in the evenings to pluck, but more times then I care to admit, I&#x27;d have one super great brow and one...not so much :)..... This product was awesome! Not only is it cheap..took me 3 minutes to do my eyebrows and that&#x27;s with sadly 2 months of overgrow  I&#x27;m Mexican/German ..so you know it was a lot) and if your just doing your face you don&#x27;t even have to warm the wax up...clean up was quick, just took water..and my brows were barely red after...If I could give this product 20 stars I would. :)</li>
            <li> The product was difficult to work with and therefore a pain to apply.  It is messy and time consuming.  It pulled on the hairs and left a nasty, painful, red rash.  I will be going back to shaving or going to the salon for a wax.</li>
            <li> This wax is really easy to use, especially for quick facial hair removal. It just needs a few seconds in the microwave and it stays warm enough to use for more than long enough to wax your face. I am really impressed with that part - other types I&#x27;ve used generally get cold and harden up after just a couple minutes. Don&#x27;t overheat it though, or it might not stick to the hairs, or worse burn your face.</li>
            <li> Salon waxing can be expensive.  This product is similar to honey/sugar hair removal. I find it to be convenient and an easy to use alternative to going to the salon.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have chemical sensitivities or allergies to chemical products and perfumes.  It is a bit messy but gets better each time I use it.  There is no offensive smell.  I do get some red bumps in several spots on my face; but they go away very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like an allergic reaction or sensitivity.  I gave it a four instead of a five because I do have to repeat areas on my face several times.  I may be applying too thick so could be my fault.  It is a great alternative to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff was WAY too messy and it didn&#x27;t even take any hair off anyway. I very much prefer the cocojo sugar wax. It&#x27;s thick and much easier to work with. And it actually takes off hair. I usually make my own sugar wax anymore because it&#x27;s basically free and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product being a bit skeptical of whether it would actually work--but was pleasantly surprised when it removed arm and bikini area hair as well as wax! The best part--it is so easy that you can do it at home without the expense of going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on all areas that you have waxed before or never shaved. However like wax, it is very painful to remove hair that was previously only shaved before--which is probably the law of nature :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are indeed reusable, just run them under some not water and the Moom desolves compleatly! I found that to be a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li> But ants really like it, so make sure you keep it in a ziplock bag.  I had to throw mine out, because even though I thought I put the lid on tight, it still attracted a hord of ants. This was my first time using Moom and I prefer it over the alternate green mixture.</li>
            <li> I used this product to remove chest and back hair from my wooly boyfriend. (His request FYI) He had a lot of hair, now he only has some hair.  The Moom worked on about 90% of it.  We followed the directions by trimming hair to 1/2 inch, he exfoliated and cleaned his skin, I heated the wax for 10 seconds in the microwave and we went to it.  I applied one strip at a time, and it took about 3 hours to do his chest and back.  I had to stop 3 times and wash and dry the strips.  The product adhered to the hair well, he said it was painful when I spread it on because it pulled at the hair, then each time I pulled off a strip he yelled, jumped around and cursed a little.  When I had finished he had little spots of blood from where the hairs had been torn out, and for 2 days after he had a weird bumpy rash.  He is hesitant to try it again on the remaining hairs, and I can see why.  He said getting a tattoo is way less painful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Customer service is HORRIBLE and does not write back!!! Product is messy. There aren&#x27;t enough supplies to go with it. Unless you are a PRO. DO NOT BUY. Even for the customer service alone I would not suggest it..</li>
            <li> Ok, a guy here. I am a cheap, do-it-yourself type. I am working out, don&#x27;t want to look like chewbacca like my father and most of my uncles. This really doesn&#x27;t work, unless you want to become a Gulag torture pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried many methods, and the best are: go pay for it to be done right, or get a body trimmer, and just keep the hair, albeit trimmed.</li>
            <li> Minimal heat required and it works extremely well.  It also gives you directions if you need that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Sticky and didn&#x27;t really remove anything, wasted of money!</li>
            <li> I have two young kids and I&#x27;m so sick of stubble and shaving. It worked great for me. I haved waxed snd hated it because it was hot, painful, and always made me break out. Two weeks after my first Moom-ing and I&#x27;m practically stubble free and not one single bump. I know it&#x27;s not the same for every reviewer... I&#x27;m white, fair-skinned, fair-haired with normal not edpecially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my lovely girlfriend as she has been wanting to try waxing for some time now. She has used an Epilator for years now but wanted to try something new. She said that the pain from Moom was about the same as using an Epilator. After she got done using Moom however there were no bumps or any irritation that she usually experienced with plucking. Both her and I were happy about that. :) She has used the whole 6-ounce jar, which took around a month to use. The hair grew back within 2 weeks but interestingly enough it grew back a lot thinner. She was very pleased about that.</li>
            <li> Ladies and gents, this stuff is great! It&#x27;s a definite must. First of all, it&#x27;s natural (which was the best part, honestly). I&#x27;m all for the green, natural, organic stuff, and having said that, sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to find green, natural, organic stuff that really really works. But Moom is absolutely fantastic. I had minimum waxing experience before; I&#x27;ve only had my eyebrows done. I&#x27;m not really sensitive to pain but I&#x27;m definitely aware of it! I decided to go lady-balls to the wall and get a waxing kit and honestly, it didn&#x27;t hurt. There was no burning, no ripping, not even any cursing! And it washed off super easily. There was a little redness the next day but organic aloe lotion helped a lot. The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t really work for my armpits, but I think that was more my inexperience than it was anything to do with the product. Definitely go for it!</li>
            <li> I have shaved since I was twelve. Well the first time I shaved was when I was twelve and then by fifteen I was shaving as often as I knew I was going to wear shorts or short sleeved shirts, and you guys shaving got old fast. By the time my hair started growing back the very same night even I decided I&#x27;d instead tweeze my under arms which is a time consuming experience that is also very unpleasant. I am now 21 and I have heard HORROR stories about getting waxed and how it hurts soooo bad. I can&#x27;t even take the pain of stubbing my toe so I have NO tolerance for pain... I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;ll bare my husband any children... Thats another matter entirely but MOOM has completely saved my life. It was actually fun to do this and since I just got my order of tea tree oil 6oz. kit today and it was my first time working with such tools I completely tore that stuff up. I ended up with a messy jar but oh were my results lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TAKE THE STRIPS OFF SLOWLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did that one time and then I realized why the directions said to do it quickly. It doesn&#x27;t hurt very badly at all. It&#x27;s almost like a little pinch and i HATE being pinched/scratched/clawed, it was minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to read the instructions. If you don&#x27;t want to buy wax warmer and do not have a microwave like myself I would definitely suggest trying to keep the protective seal handy so you can stick it back on when you are dipping your little pot of miracle into warm water. You don&#x27;t want it to get hot like a wax would, you just want it to be warm and lessen the original thick consistency enough so that application is smoother. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY reason for the four stars is that I guess because of all my shaving my legs were a little brown and it looked to me like after moom-ing the brown layer of my skin was taken along with my hair. Eh, I figured it&#x27;s damage from the shaving. I&#x27;ll be sure to follow up this review, I already ordered a larger size of moom!</li>
            <li> and MOOM was a fantastic choice! I read all the reviews on here and decided, \\&quot;Hey, why not?\\&quot; I will continue to use this product with confidence! My first time waxing was the hardest though since I had a low tolerance for pain. Now, though, it&#x27;s simple, quick, and clean! I have recommended this product to all of my friends considering waxing and will continue to do so, this product is just fabulous!!</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to figure this out, but I love it now. It works best for me with one heat cycle in the microwave. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> All you other Italian girls out there will know what I mean when I say that I got really tired of getting my upper lip and brows waxed every 10 days or so. After reading the reviews, I decided to give Moom a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I didn&#x27;t get every single little microscopic hair on the first try, but I think it will just take a little practice to get perfect results. I&#x27;m so relieved -- no more spending $100 a month or more on waxing! It is super easy to clean up, and I love that the muslin strips are washable and reusable. Moom, I&#x27;m a convert!  :o)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff! I ordered it after experiencing TWO infections from spas that double-dipped their wax instruments. The product is easy to use and easy to clean up. The instruction booklet was really helpful as well. I am a total convert! I will never have someone else wax me again.</li>
            <li> Wax is stronger so may be preferred for some hair types or at least some stubborn hairs.  However, this works well for most hair.  It is easier to clean up, very easy, which is a big plus. This is a nice kit and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I am waiting to see if the regrowth is a problem or not a problem, as often claimed.</li>
            <li> works well! I didn&#x27;t like that I had to microwave it every time I use it (only 10 seconds, but still).</li>
            <li> Works great, there is a learning curve for sure.  Left me smooth with zero irritation. I love the results and plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Unbearable pain.  I followed all of the directions.  You are pulling hair out by the root in sensitive areas, sooooo I&#x27;m not sure what I was hoping for.  I guess I read all the reviews that made this sound dreamy. Ouch!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use on bikini. While I liked this product for my legs I and its gentle and effective, I feel that it is not strong enough for the bikini area which although sensitive I think benefits from a very strong but quick wax. I love how washable this is and how it leaves skin soft BUT it does require double application sometimes and that is what makes me hesitant about the bikini area.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other waxing products, I was really disappointed with the hair removal, the messiness, and how incredibly sticky they were.  Upon trying Moom, however, I immediately noticed how different this is from the other waxing products.  It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily (warm tap water or handsoap &amp; water!).  It also has a very light, clean scent, and the reusable strips are great!  They&#x27;re very simple to clean and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying those disposable strips.  I highly suggest Moom if you&#x27;re looking for an at-home wax!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews I read on Amazon and I am extremely pleased with this product.  I tried hot wax (Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavendar version for sensitive skin)  While the hot wax did not irritate my skin - it was tedious, messy, and hard to get the right temperature.  This Moom - was so much easier because it is easy to get off with water and reapply.  With the wax, it sometimes clung to my skin and then I had to remove patches of it.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with Moom.  Plus, I love that it is made of environmentally friendly products - even the strips are reusable!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me for some reason. Would take off some hair, but most of it was left behind. I&#x27;ve used better waxes.</li>
            <li> So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn&#x27;t really irritate my skin. For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much. It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice. I am torn about the product because it works well in some areas and almost not at all in others. I don&#x27;t think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and did not work, do not waste your money really bad product. I tried to use twice but did not work.</li>
            <li> Everyone that is giving this a negative review obviously has issues with reading directions in a product manual (located inside the box) and following instructions EXACTLY how they are written......... This product works PERFECTLY if used properly and carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to take the fine hair off my upper lip, and my fine chin hair, some peach-fuzz across the sides of my face, and define my eyebrow line. I heated it for 15 seconds (even though the manual says you don&#x27;t really need to do this for facial applications) I did it anyway, it was easier to apply a PAPER THIN COATING to my face using the applicators provided. Keyword: PAPER THIN (read the manual)... Before I applied it I WASHED AND DRIED MY FACE (As per the manuals instructions - wash makeup and oil off your face) Keyword: WASH AND DRY FACE (READ THE MANUAL!!!!!) The hydrophobic qualities of this product WILL NOT ADHERE PROPERLY IF NOT APPLIED TO A CLEAN, DRY, OIL AND MAKEUP FREE AREA! After applying the Moom to my hair the DIRECTION OF HAIR GROWTH (READ MANUAL) I gently patted a small section of fabric on to the area with Moom, and HOLDING MY SKIN TAUGHT (READ MANUAL) I pulled it off IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION (READ MANUAL) of hair growth.... It ALL CAME OUT of my face ... wow magic.........................Which wasn&#x27;t that surprising to me, as I read the manual, followed the directions exactly and got the results the product promised. If you are someone who hates to read manuals, follow directions, submit to a little bit of pain from pulling hair directly from the root out of your face, or overall wants the removal of hair from your face to be done in like 2 minutes (this takes time people, putting a small amount of Moom on each area and pulling off takes timeeee!!!!!!!!) then this product is NOT FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise: You will LOVE it since it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all for me. It warmed up and spread fine, however it didn&#x27;t pull a single hair from my leg. I have used many different kinds of leg wax in my quest to never shave ever again - so I am confident that I did apply the product and use it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I am a white female with semi-coarse leg hair, so maybe its best for people with thinner leg hair. Personally, the only type of wax that I have found to work unfailingly is hard wax.</li>
            <li> My previous product was Body Shop&#x27;s Sugarings, but when they took that off the market, I had to go to the professional salon. A French friend of mine had tried Moom, and it&#x27;s big in France!    I&#x27;m thankful because not only is it organic, it&#x27;s pain free and easy to wash off. I&#x27;ve been using baby powder to prep my skin before I apply the wax, since it makes it easier, and the results are cleaner.</li>
            <li> I heard my girlfriend talking (isn&#x27;t that how this stuff starts?) about how she gave up shaving for waxing and will never go back. As someone with horribly sensitive skin, I decided to give in and try waxing. Doing some research, I discovered that sugaring is waxing&#x27;s nice cousin and felt it would be better for my skin than regular waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- MOOM is easy to heat&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with plenty of strips to work with&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to remove excess sugar with damp washrag&lt;br /&gt;- Can go over same area if needed&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps skin soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- MOOM needs reheating every 15 minutes or so&lt;br /&gt;- Harder to remove coarse hair (had to go over a few spots three or four times)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets oily if used in same spot more than twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used MOOM on my underarm, bikini and legs with fantastic results. I&#x27;ve never been waxed before and this was a first time experience that I actually enjoyed, if that is possible with hair removal. I did experience some very minor and not visible bruising with use, but as this was my first time it could have been an error on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will answer questions if you would like to message me a question about use.</li>
            <li> It has to be hot to spread, problem is it burns if you have it hot enough to spread.  Then, if you allow it to cool, it won&#x27;t spread, but it will grab your hairs and start pulling them immediately.  It was a bad buying decision for me.  I have 95% of the jar contents still and have no plans to try using it again.</li>
            <li> Messy and hard to deal with.  It&#x27;s easy to burn youself if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a natural food store but I always come to Amazon for reviews so I wanted to write about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the recommendation of a user and did not microwave. Will try to microwave next time. I was attempting underarm hair. The best trick for me is applying baby powder since I live in Hawaii and it&#x27;s humid and I easily get sweaty. It did not grab any hair without the baby powder applied and I have medium hair in my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the wax to the cloth first and then placed on skin taking note the direction of hair before putting the cloth on my skin. I dabbed until the sugar wax seeped through the cloth (really grab to the hair) even pressing firmly. Then I whipped the cloth off in the opposite direction of hair growth. It didn&#x27;t matter if I rubbed the cloth in the direction of hair growth just that I pull in the opposite. Yay little hairs came off! This is the first time I ever waxed my armpits so they&#x27;re sensitive and I could only do it for a couple of tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a miracle and pulled only a minority of hair out but I&#x27;m satisfied. It&#x27;s easy to clean off from my skin, the cloths and the applicator. All reusable things too which is fabulous and not to mention no harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I try in bikini area. Attached photo to show it pulled out hair from root.</li>
            <li> Not what it claims or says it does.... not a good product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a waste of money and effort</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It&#x27;s natural, reasonably priced and the process is a whole lot easier than I was anticipating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had electrolysis in the past.  It was pretty rough to endure; the upper lip was the worst!  I could feel it in my teeth.  I know, weird.  I went to shaving because plucking hair on my lip was too &amp;#34;ouchie&amp;#34; for me.  So, all these years have trickled by and I have been chicken to try waxing or sugaring.  Most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about waxing may still use it because it is so effective, but they don&#x27;t especially appreciate the pain.  I could always tell they&#x27;d had it done because their lip was swollen.  I tolerated shaving because it was painless but it is short lived and the hair comes back plentiful and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a MOOM kit several months ago but was holding out until I found some lidocaine gel (for the lip).  But after watching some youtube videos on MOOM, I decided to cowgirl up and go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it the first time today.  Way less discomfort than plucking and it worked really well.  It wasn&#x27;t painless but I have felt worse zipping off a super stuck adhesive bandage.  I can handle this route for sure!  I endured letting the hair get longer, as they say that makes the product work best.  I also read over repetitive use there will be less hair growing back.  A person won&#x27;t have to wait for it to get so long because the hair will be finer and release easier.  yippee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little redness occurred during the process but that went away within 30 minutes.  I have no skin irritation or rash.  The product has nothing in it that stings.  I am fair skinned and very sensitive to A LOT of ingredients in typical OTC products.  I don&#x27;t bother buying them any more.  I just use extra light olive oil for face and body.  My skin feels smooth from no hair; no little bumps all over the chin area like shaving leaves; I suppose because the hair is still so close to the surface; my skin also feels moisturized and soft.  ...Smooth skin after all these years and using natural, organic ingredients.  ...how very cool is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to give an update on how long it lasts.  With shaving of course, I could feel stubble by the end of the day.  O_o  I&#x27;m super pleased and I think it&#x27;s worth it for anyone to try.  I don&#x27;t get as bothered about shaving my legs, but I might just go for it and do those next.  I wonder if MOOM has stock options!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  It was extremely thick at room temperature and broke the sticks provided during application.  On the small amount of wax that I was able to apply, it did remove some hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just found it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> At first I did not see any improvement as I have to tweeze significantly after that initial use. However, after sticking with it; I can now go two weeks without needing to wax. Before I waxed my chin every four days.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing and less mess because it&#x27;s completely dissolvable in water.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about self-waxing, but now that I have used Moom I can&#x27;t see myself ever going to get a professional wax again. It is a truly wonderful hair removal method. I used it for my bikini area, and it was very successful. I didn&#x27;t think that I would be pleased with the results from the first use; before I began the waxing process, I assured myself that I would need to be patient and give it a few tries just in case it didn&#x27;t work out at first. But lo and behold, my first time results were as good as professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all beauty endeavors, it will take practice to master over time. I gave the MOOM hair removal kit four stars just because it was rather messy and took about 2 hours- but I repeat, it was my first time MOOMing a rather difficult area. The directions in the package as well as the instructional video online are very helpful and made my hair removal even more thorough. I presume that with practice I&#x27;ll become both more timely and more graceful at \\&quot;MOOMing\\&quot;. Even though the process is messy, clean up is a cinch. All you need is warm water and soap to clean Moom off your skin, the reusable cloth strips, and any surface where it might have dripped. Lastly, it&#x27;s economical! I used maybe 1/8th of the 6 oz jar and washed the cloth strips for my next session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing salon professionals always say that the more you wax, the better quality your hair will become over time. Truth be told, most of us never get to that place because wax services are just so expensive. I can proudly say that, thanks to Moom, I will finally get to experience all the benefits that long-term, dedicated waxing can bring. I&#x27;m even going to try it on my legs and eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s economical, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s empowering, and it&#x27;s even quite a bit of fun! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to both my sister AND my best friend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any hair. My hair is thick and it almost seems like it&#x27;s not strong enough for my hair. Maybe if you have this hair?</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair off in one try but does the job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, wax is malleable and heats up in 10 seconds, the strips are also nice, and the oil is a nice touch. I had no problems using this kit and it is good if you want to be quick without leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The directions are clearly written. I like that all the sticks and cloth are included. I was really happily suprised at how well the product works. This is a keeper. I&#x27;ll see how long this lasts. I expect I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Most excellent product. Easy to use, works well ( after a first try,) safe for my skin, and should last a good while. Well worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> I use it only for facial hair. I&#x27;ve had it since January and at first I used it once a week but now I can go a little longer without waxing (sometimes a week and a half since my hair has been growing slowly now). I am about half way through if that helps so it does last a while (if you&#x27;re using it for your face). Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, doesn&#x27;t hurt too much, don&#x27;t have to warm it up when using it for facial hair, and it is easy to wash the cloths. Definitely recommend it and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love it but its easier to use your hand than kit&#x60;s tools</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural wax, and threw out my Veet wax strips because of the BHA and red dye content. I use this on my armpits, legs and bikini area.  The last 2 months I have jumped on the Brazilian band wagon.  I didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to do.  I had waxed most of my bikini area except left a little strip on each side of the lips.  I was even able to do my butt, but not without some struggle I have to admit (and I&#x27;m pretty flexible).  I don&#x27;t have a microwave so I boil the jar in some water on the stove.  I&#x27;m pretty fast with my waxing so it doesn&#x27;t get too sticky or cold, but the liquid-y texture makes the best results I think.  Just make sure the area is clean and dry and only put a paper-thin amount on the area.  Do small areas, not big areas.  Baby or talcum powder is great, helps the wax stick more to the hairs than the skin.  And make sure your hair is at least 1/4&#x27; in long before you wax or you&#x27;re wasting your time.  I&#x27;ve already recommended this to a friend who never waxed.  She didn&#x27;t like the pain but loved the result so she&#x27;ll keep it up.</li>
            <li> i was worried it was going to hurt but it really wasnt too bad. but it only removed like 10% of the hair.you could hardly even tell :( oh well back to shaving i guess.</li>
            <li> I think a rookie waxer may have issues using this product, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing or willing to take your time to learn how to use the product (trial and error or YouTube tutorials), you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have only used it to remove unwanted facial hair so I can&#x27;t speak to using it on larger area such as legs. Where this is not pain free it is much less painful than other waxes I have tried. It does a good job on removing the hair though it does take a couple of times. Also the ingredients in this wax are much more gentle on my face than other waxes. With other waxes the area would stay red for a couple of hours and usually I would have a few zits develop in the area after use. With this wax the redness wears off quickly and no breakouts afterwards. That is great for my sensitive skin. I love this wax and would recommend it for facial use. Using it strictly on the face a 6 oz jar lasted me over 2 years.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, and is cruelty-free and organic. The cloth strips are great as they can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my arms, although was kind of painful to put it ON and spread it out. It pulled on the hairs. Had to go over twice. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now though..and it has become like a honey consistency to the point where I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Oh well. I&#x27;m moving on to hard wax now that doesn&#x27;t use strips (gigi)</li>
            <li> i hate this. it doesnt take all the hair off your legs and then you have wax stuck to your leg for the rest of the day until you get a chance to scrub it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my very sensitive skin. Very easy cleanup with warm water and love that the strips are reusable. Just make sure if you are cutting up the strips to make smaller ones to use pinking shears so the fabric doesn&#x27;t fray.</li>
            <li> Havent tried a whole lot of waxing products but this stuff seems pretty legit. still hurts of course but seems to not irritate.</li>
            <li> I am very new to the waxing/sugaring world - I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows waxed and used cold wax strips on my bikini line once; therefore, I was pretty nervous about using this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe that using Moom on my bikini line hurt less than waxing my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned, so I am always dealing with razor burn and skin irritation. I used Moom on my bikini line and armpits, and after using anti-bump pads and lotion, I am shockingly bump free! My skin has never been happier :)</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and have used this product, its a good buy.. but I wish the quantity was more.</li>
            <li> My first time ever sugaring... I wanted to get a kit, and a good price, to see how it worked.  I will need some practice for sure. But I was very happy with the kit and the product.  I&#x27;ve had waxes before on my legs and they hurt a lot. This sugaring still hurt, but didn&#x27;t seem to hurt quite as much. I am looking for a good product I can do at home so I can avoid going out to have it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did one leg and it worked pretty good, though like I said I&#x27;ll need some practice, so I&#x27;ve already ordered a refill. This kit only lasted me one leg, but that could be because I am not proficient at sugaring yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little bit left in the jar and a couple of days later I tried the other leg... not sure why, but the little that was left did not get thick enough to rip out any hairs at all.  Even after leaving it on my skin for a while.  But, I&#x27;ll try again, maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it well enough when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Works great but so sticky that it&#x27;s hard to open the Harv</li>
            <li> This product is great, easy to use and not a messy cleanup. I use it on my legs and other areas, great for sensitive areas but in my opinion, NOT FOR A BRAZILIAN WAX. Sometimes you have to go over the same area twice and I don&#x27;t want to go over my bikini area twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the strips (like most strips) get frayed after first use, and got more frayed when I washed them so I just threw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few tips:&lt;br /&gt;--You want to make sure you are putting a small amount and spreading it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;--If the wax is too thick it won&#x27;t grab the hair as well. If the wax is painfully pulling at your hairs when you&#x27;re applying it, it&#x27;s because you let the wax get too cool.&lt;br /&gt;--Cut the strips into smaller pieces if they are not grabbing enough hair or if you find it to be too painful. You&#x27;ll have more control over smaller strips but the process will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;--Use baby powder to keep your skin dry if necessary, the wax won&#x27;t work on wet or sweaty skin&lt;br /&gt;--Waxing causes just as many ingrowns as shaving if you don&#x27;t exfoliate after use!</li>
            <li> it removed almost all my hair but I was hoping it would work on facial hair and it did not.wasn&#x27;t painful at all. Not compared to some of the other wax is that I have used.</li>
            <li> I just get this weird fix from ripping hair out of my face after subjecting myself to having facial waxing at a nail shop.  It is quite catching.  It does not bring tears to my eyes when I used this stuff, but it does take the unwanted hair off.</li>
            <li> For the last few years, I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilian bikini waxes at a local waxing salon, but, at the cost of $55 + tip, I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper alternative that didn&#x27;t involve nasty chemicals or too much pain. Based on the reviews here, I decided to be brave and try the Moom kit, and am definitely a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In years past, I&#x27;ve tried various other home hair-removal methods:  an epilator (too painful), a Gigi brand home waxing kit (also too painful and very messy), and Veet and Nair (but have disliked using chemical products in my nether regions).  This Moom product is by far the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it did not hurt as badly as regular waxing (and the woman I go to has been doing waxing for almost 20 years).  Sure, there is some pain involved, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, and, when you wax on a regular basis, the pain lessens since the hair root weakens and the hairs pull out more easily.  Second, it was very easy to use.  I only had to heat it in my microwave the initial time for 10 seconds, and it stayed warm enough to use for the entire 30 minutes I needed to do my waxing.  (I went slowly since this was my first time doing a full wax on myself, but I imagine that next time it should only take me about 15 minutes.)  Third, it was very easy to clean up.  After finishing up , I tossed the muslin strips in a sink full of warm water for about five minutes, and was happy to see that all of the Moom and hair rinsed right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a small tub of the Moom product itself, 12 large muslin strips, 6 small muslin strips, 2 large popsicle sticks, and 2 small popsicle sticks.  I used about 1/6 of the tub to wax my entire bikini area, and so this should last awhile.  Once I finish the tub, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase the Moom refills since the muslin strips and popsicle sticks are reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As several other reviewers have mentioned, also be sure to follow the directions carefully:  using some baby powder, applying a very thin layer in the direction of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  This product also contains a small booklet that gives pictures and tips for waxing various body parts (face, bikini, legs, underarms, etc.) that was very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another tip, it&#x27;s also helpful to apply some hydrocortisone cream after waxing to help with redness and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!of hair growth, and pulling hair out in the *opposite* direction are key for a smooth waxing.  This product also contains a small booklet that gives pictures and tips for waxing various body parts (face, bikini, legs, underarms, etc.) that was very useful.      As another tip, it&#x27;s also helpful to apply some hydrocortisone cream after waxing to help with redness and bumps.     Overall, if this continues to work as well as it did this first time (and I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t), I&#x27;ll never go back to salon waxing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already ordering refills of the wax.  I love that the cloth strips are reusable.  They rinsed completely clean after soaking in warm water.  It was not great for really course hair like on the underarms but worked great on legs and bikini line.  The sugar wax smells delicious, rinsed off with water, and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  The day after my skin was gorgeous and hair free.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have gone to a salon to be professionally waxed as well as done it myself with products from walgreens and also with nads. HELLO PAIN! O my gosh. Nads is SUPER sticky- even when you heat it up. It&#x27;s more painful spreading it on the hair then actually ripping, and you have to buy new fabric strips everytime. Waxing at the salon is super expensive. Oh and fyi I use this for the bikini region. Moom is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad, the prodcut smells super good, my super-ultra-sensitive-allergic-to-everything skin doesn&#x27;t have any side effects with Moom. I seriously love it. I have my mom and sister turned onto it now too. The strips are re-usuable and machine washable so you don&#x27;t have to spend extra money buying more and more strips. Waxing does hurt, but not THAT bad, and this is for sure the best way to go.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy wax and I read good reviews on Moom wax so I thought I would give this one a try. I think it was as painless as wax could get. Easy to clean up off your skin and the fabric is reuseable. I need to warm it up much more than the instructions said but that could be my microwave. Great product if your just wanting to try out wax or even if you have been doing it for awhile now.</li>
            <li> this was my first time waxing my body.  it wasn&#x27;t so bad on my back - small patches of thin hair.  my stomach and chest (dense, coarse hair) was very painful to do but the results were excellent - i&#x27;d rather do this once or twice a month vs shaving every few days.  the instructions were simple, the wax was easy to apply without being too hot, and cleanup was a snap - just a little warm water.  the 6 oz jar was just enough to get some small areas on my back and my entire chest/stomach.  i experienced some irritation but it cleared right up after applying some thayers witch hazel (alcohol free).  you can clean and reuse the strips (after drying) which i needed to do to before i was done. i ordered another kit so i&#x27;ll have enough strips to finish in one shot next time.</li>
            <li> I used to have my upper lip waxed a few times a year, but now I do my own at home with the greatest of ease with Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a brilliant product - it washes off the strips (reusable) and off your face so easily with cold water. A pleasure to use, simple to do yourself and very efficient. The best experience ever.</li>
            <li> I want to thank moom for creating a product with such natural, non harmful ingredients! Plus, no animal testing! This is truly a dream product and I&#x27;m so thankful I&#x27;ve come across it. It&#x27;s actually works really well, too!</li>
            <li> This product refuses to reach a &amp;#34;honey-like&amp;#34; consistency. It needs a higher temperature to reach a spreadable state. What a gimmick!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!!!!! Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t immediately have success- it took me a bit to get the technique of waxing down (not too much wax, don&#x27;t press too hard..etc)  Shaving is a thing of the past after discovering this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product and it dose work</li>
            <li> I was willing to give this a try even if it was just as painful as waxing, because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try sugar wax for a long time, and Moom was recommended to me. But reading the reviews I saw many people said that Moom was less painful than wax--and indeed that was the case for me. I found it easy to use according to the directions and very effective on my leg. (Yes, one leg--see below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the downside was that it took almost the entire jar to wax one leg. Now, I admit I have very well-muscled calves, so YMMV. But given the cost, I think in future I will reuse the Moom jar and supplies and just DIY my own sugar wax. I also found that Moom didn&#x27;t work well on my face. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but I&#x27;d love to remove it all in one go instead of plucking, but for whatever reason Moom just didn&#x27;t seem to grab it well enough. Maybe I need to grow the hair longer? Yeah, that&#x27;s never going to happen.</li>
            <li> First time waxer, and it worked like a charm. When I was heating it in the microwave in ten-second bursts three times, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was warming up at all, but when I tried it on a small patch it was HOT. So I let it cool off for about 15 minutes (it does NOT cool quickly... I waxed for at least 30 minutes after the initial 15min wait - so 45 min total - and it was still gooey). Easy to spread with the sticks (but you will have some long strings of honey from the jar to your body, so be prepared with a wet cloth to wipe your hands and any surfaces as necessary). I did the bikini area, which I assume is one of the most sensitive body parts, and yet I had very little pain. Really follow the directions and 1) don&#x27;t use too much wax, just enough to spread it very thinly; 2) don&#x27;t press down on the strips, just rub three times quickly; 3) don&#x27;t overheat the wax... and the wax melts from the center so even though the bottle feels cool, the wax in the center can be hot; 4) trim the hair to 1cm, any longer and there might be some pain; and 5) spread in the direction of hair growth, and pull skin taut while pulling off strips in the opposite direction. The wax also wipes off really well with some warm water, so it was easy to clean my body, hands, sticks, and strips for next time. I only did it last night so I can&#x27;t comment on the rate of regrowth, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied with the process and the results and there&#x27;s still so much product left I think it&#x27;ll last me at least 6 months or a year. Total bargain.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it now three times, and I have to say the best way to use it is exactly how the directions say. I&#x27;m so happy this is an all natural product and comes with these reusable cloths. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used it three time now (three times on my armpits, lip and under chin) and it works wonders to get the finest of facial hair that you can&#x27;t necessarily see, but can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also my first time using any sort of wax product, and I can say without a doubt, I&#x27;m glad it was this!</li>
            <li> Love love love this wax! It really lasts long!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> When you look through the reviews all you see are the five star reviews on top- but it&#x27;s the one and two star reviews that are actually helpful and TRUE. This \\&quot;waxing\\&quot; kit is cute, but it&#x27;s LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. It&#x27;s not watery liquid but it&#x27;s liquid enough that when you apply it to your skin and place the cloth over it, the two things don&#x27;t adhere to each other. Not to mention, unless you&#x27;re a corpse your skin is warm and this thing is made mainly of sugar which liquefies even more on warm skin! At first I thought I just wasn&#x27;t following the directions, but I read it, reread it, re-applied the wax over and over again, but this item is totally trash. How they have so many positive reviews I can&#x27;t imagine, but it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to fake them. What a waste of ten dollars- such a scam.</li>
            <li> This is the product to have for any woman or man! it makes life so much easier and the hair stays gone for a long time. Great for sensitive skin like mine. I would recomend it to anyone. make sure hair is not too long and not too short</li>
            <li> Moom removed the long hairs on my legs perfectly but left the ones that were a millimeter or less. My legs looked smooth but did not feel smooth. It works very well for removing the bulk of my unwanted eyebrow hairs, with a very little bit of tidying with the tweezers the next day after the swelling has subsided. After I used up the pot I made a batch of my own since, having used the Moom, I knew what it was supposed to look and feel like. It&#x27;s decent stuff.</li>
            <li> First attempt: Legs. tried 20 strips with slight results and decided to wait for hair to grow longer (They want HALF an inch of hair!)  Second attempt: 2 weeks worth of leg hair (I&#x27;m not waiting any longer!! who does that?) 20 strips again. slight results.  Underarms: 2 weeks worth of underarm hair. 70 strips (NO KIDDING, i bought extra), bruising, bleeding, and still some underarm hair left. I&#x27;m done!  --please mind you that i have read instructions thoroughly as well as watched instructional videos as well as try different things as i go along. I really really tried hard to make this work for me and the only thing i did not follow is the half an inch of hair they wanted you to grow out first. (i have a hard time believing that anyone does) I did for a brief moment try the bikini area but i chickened out after it started to rip because it hurt so bad. (it did get a lot of hair) so my conclusion is that it might be good for the bikini area. (but then again, you would think my underarms would have worked since that&#x27;s thicker hair too.) I&#x27;m baffled why this product supposedly worked perfect for so many people. I feel slow but i&#x27;ve tried my very best.&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!!  Sticky, messy, but nonetheless awesome!  Clean up is not too bad, either, since this is a water-based product. I ordered this kit and since then have also ordered more removal strips and several of the the 12 oz size hair remover.  Instead of using the popsicle stick applicators, I use a small cake decorating spatula, which nicely spreads the thin layer needed and helps the product go farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution - this product is made of sugar. My puppy went crazy trying to lick the remnants off my leg.  Not sure if any of the product would hurt him, but I don&#x27;t want to find out!</li>
            <li> I am pretty experienced with at home waxing.  I normally use the hard wax that you have to microwave, and not only is it messy, but extremely painful, difficult to manage, and inconvenient.  I use this product on my face, and it was sooooo easy.  You just spread it on, place the strips over it, and pull them off.  It was very effective for me, comparable to the result I get from using hard wax.  The primary ingredient is sugar, so it&#x27;s very pleasant.  There is definitely pain involved, as expected, but it&#x27;s much better than trying to tweeze the hairs off, fast, and the least messy waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> This product works fabulously and is very well priced here on Amazon. Much lowere than most products in the store and works better to boot! The cloths that come with the product rinse out very easily and the product also rinses off skin easilly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known about \\&quot;sugaring\\&quot; for 15 years, but I didn&#x27;t believe it worked and it just sounded like too much work.  My Arab friends always relied on the sugaring method, but even though their eyebrows and face looked great I wasn&#x27;t convinced.  Anyway, I didn&#x27;t know you could buy this product already made, and when I saw it a TJMAXX last week for five bucks I decided to try it.      I&#x27;m not great at eyebrows, and I usually get them waxed but the place I go to is is 1.5 hours roundtrip plus the wait time and waxing time.  This usually chews up my Saturday or Sunday, and I hate that.  I needed to de-werewolf my face so I decided to try this product at home late one night while in bed (I know, not the best set up).      First, this is NOT wax.  It is sugar that has been carmelized.  I did my eyebrows.  It was MUCH less painful than threading and less painful than waxing.  IT WORKED.  Yes, it is a little more difficult to spread on your skin because it is NOT warm wax.  But, hot wax always scalded my delicate eyebrow skin and left it dry and scaley.  The GREAT thing about this product is that it WASHES off with WATER.  I was AMAZED at that.  We all know how difficult it is to remove wax residue from the tender red waxed areas on our face. Especially considering that the top layer of the skin has also been removed.  I didn&#x27;t have the raw, red, tender skin with this product.  I was SURPRISED and PLEASED.    Next, I did my \\&quot;moustache.\\&quot;  Again, product worked well.  What&#x27;s even better is that I was able to rinse off the fabric strips with tap water and they were clean and ready to be reused after drying.  Granted, you&#x27;ll need to buy bigger strips and more product to do larger areas, but that is common sense...    I WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend this product for facial hair removal.  I will try other areas and update my review later.    PROS: removed facial hair with less pain than waxing and threading; product residue easily washes off face and hair removal strips with just water;strips are reusable after drying; no terrible odor; no need to heat up; convenient small container so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a huge pot of sugar    CONS: beginners may find it difficult to spread the sugar (unless experienced and expert at waxing) initially, but I think with practice it will get better</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I have used it on my underarms. It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean. However, I have had a hard time with the temperature and the texture of the wax! If I microwave it about 15 seconds, the texture is good to spread but it&#x27;s too hot for my underarms to bear. If I microwave it only 10 seconds, the texture is too thick. Plus the wax in the jar gets thicken very quickly. I&#x27;m not sure that I want to order another one.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and everything I have ever used has caused problems for me. I used to get my eyebrows waxed at a salon and hated how much it hurt and how red I was for a couple of days afterwards.This works so much better than waxing tweezing or threading for me. I just used this and already the redness (pinkness) is fading, and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all. It stings a little, but nothing like wax. I wasn&#x27;t sure I could do it myself but my eyebrows look great. It is a little messy, but it washes off everything easily. If I can use it anyone can, you may need to practice a bit, but it is worth it, great results and it only needs to be warmed a little so no worries about burns.</li>
            <li> The Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit is the best way to remove hair!  Less pain than wax and you can reuse the cotton strips.</li>
            <li> Love it, I got my first sugar waxing at Shobha in DC.  I would pay 25+ with tips. If you have to go pro they are the shop for all things sugar waxing. Then I got to thinking if this stuff is made from sugar and lemon juice, how much could i screw up if I did it myself.  The first try was crazy as you would expect.  However the second time  I did step by step what I observed at Shobha.  Most importantly I applied baby powder before applying the sugaring.  I then used masking tape to tape my shoulder and forarms back to make the skin taunt, then I warmed it like suggested to a honey consistency and applied it real light, then I pulled it in the opposite direction of my skin growth. Eureka, I was so happy.  I am another satisfied customer.  I also went out online and read all the reviews to get tips for doing it.  With continued practice, my underarms will look like a pro did them.  I save time and money, especially time, I could not be happier.  When I order this one, I also ordered a similar product from Amazon and I trashed it. The two did not compare.</li>
            <li> Works great! I love that it is all natural and is easy to remove. It just rinses off with water. No residue like wax. I have had great results using it on my face  and arms.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been waxing my own legs for a couple of years, MOOM was easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for the best hair follicle ripping experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ensure hair is 1/4&amp;#34; - 1/2&amp;#34; long otherwise lots of hairs will get left behind.  Too short, and they wont get picked up.. too long and it&#x27;ll just be a gross painful mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do some prepping before hand - the day before waxing, exfoliate skin to remove dead skin and moisturize lightly ( i like to use coconut oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Have your area ready - lay out some paper towels or anything to catch sticky drips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Heat the wax to a thick syrup like consistency - I find that when the consistency is like thick syrup - its easiest to spread thinly which helps pick up the hair best.  Of course test this on your skin first - if you&#x27;re sensitive to heat wait a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Spread wax thinly - spread the wax very thinly in the direction of hair growth.  You want there to be a very thin and shiny coat, but not have it globby or streaky.  Then immediately put the strip on, firmly press down in the direction of hair growth a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Ripping the strip - with one hand, pull your skin taut in the opposite direction of hair growth, while the other hand quickly rips the strip off in the opposite direction of hair growth (just like ripping off a bandaid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve done this correctly, that should minimize the pain and the same strip can be used several more times (if there wasn&#x27;t too much hair after the first rip)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Worked well when we followed the directions. Personally I think it works better when the wax is warmer and can spread thinner without pulling on loose hair. My husband and I both use this and have great results. First time the hair was really thick and was definitely difficult to remove, but when we tried again in 5 weeks it took a third of the time/product and barely hurt at all. After four uses total, we still have half a jar of wax and the washed strips hold up perfectly.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m addicted to waxing my legs. I&#x27;ve used it all. This organic wax is fantastic!  Borderline painless, no mess what so ever. Washes off completely with water (no more sticky mess!!!). Leaves my legs super duper soft. Annnd...it smells (and tastes)(I didn&#x27;t eat it, some was on my finger) delicious,  almost smells like something I&#x27;d feed to my nephews and neice. Love this sugar wax! Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and love it. It does not irritate and it works great.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me on my ultra thin leg hairs, but it&#x27;s nice enough for other areas. Be careful not to over warm it, I have to microwave it for less than recommended on the package or it&#x27;s too thin. The strips are great and the product washes out of them easily</li>
            <li> As someone who used to spend $15 for underarm waxing, this a steal. This was my first time self waxing so it took a couple of tries to get it right, by my third time waxing I got the hang of pulling the strip correctly. It lasted be a total of 20 waxes, I&#x27;d do my under arms and bikini line. I love it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I wax and saw that this product was all natural, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy, much easier than ripping your pubes out with your bare hands like I have been doing for the last 12 years.  It is also tasty, I believe you can spread some over buttered toast if you are waxing yourself during breakfast.</li>
            <li> Gotta love a wax that comes off with water! Def use baby powder on your hair before you put on the wax.  I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for 6 years now after I learned how from my Brazilian friend.  A sugar based wax is the best because it comes off with water.  I would buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair, it pulls a few little hairs out with each pull. No matter if I tried it on the more course hair on my legs or the less course stubs of my eyebrows to even the finest hair above my lip or under my chin..</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this product many ways, in microwave, room temp, clean skin, semi clean skin, short regrowth, suggested regrowth, etc... And it never gets the hair the first time. My skin is sensitive so doing it over the same area hurts. Not as effective as I hoped</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is follow the directions on the paper that comes with it. If its your first time waxing or using this product, use numbing cream. Especially if you are using it on the bikini area. It felt horrible! It does get the hair off tho. aits messy, so I youre looking to wax, I would suggest using the pre-MOOM strips because they would be less messy. Alsp The MOOM is NOT $12.59! Its more like $20 because the product itself, shipping an handling and taxes! Ive never paid taxess on anything Ive bought here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love that it washes off with water if you make a mistake. Unlike other waxes that harden and become really difficult to remove. The strips are also washable and reusable. I bought it for bikini waxing but found out you can use it pretty much anywhere on your body. Heats up quickly and stays warm. Would highly recommend for a home waxing kit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!</li>
            <li> Really lousy stuff. It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin and seems to cool off before you can even get it applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair removal products and they all seem to be either too messy, too expensive, too painful, too complicated, or too irritating to my skin. I was about to resign myself to being a fluff ball when I discovered moom. As it is advertised, it is all natural (and therefore healthier for your skin) and is easy to clean up as it is sugar based. All in all, it was easy to clean up (not only with spills, but if I got it in the wrong place - no more worries about accidentally ripping off half of my eyebrow), inexpensive, surprisingly less painful (the first time I used it I thought it hadn&#x27;t pulled the hair out), easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. The only down side was that after I had been using it for a couple months it developed this caramel candy like texture and didn&#x27;t work well -- I&#x27;m thinking this was due to exposure to the air. Even though I only got to use half of the container, I still felt that I got great value for my money and have reordered.</li>
            <li> I find jar wax very annoying to use because its very messy and doesn&#x27;t stay warm during the entire waxing process.  This wax is better the other wax products I have tried because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and its the only one I have found that I have actually gotten to work. Regardless, I find it easier to buy the prewax strips and use those as they seem to work so much better for me everytime.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of practice for areas such as eyebrows. tastes good if some gets in your mouth while doing lip area. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed. If the jar can be used to the very end, I won&#x27;t have to go to the spa for waxing for about 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some famous brands of wax before trying Moom. I am an asian and have a very coarse, thick hair. Other brands of wax would leave a few hair strands, which I would have to get rid by plucking or shaving after I am done waxing. With Moom, I dint have to do that. It cleaned so well, I was amazed by the results. This is less painful and no mess at all. For me, Sugar wax never left such a result. I have also tried Nair wax &amp; its smell is so over powering, by the time Im done waxing, I used to have a headache. Moom feels fresh and smooth after the job is done. The price is great! I will never go back to any other wax and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Please do yourself a favor and order this product! I cannot believe how easy, and well this product worked. For the past 2 years I have been paying a salon $57 every 4 weeks to have my bikini area sugared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make my own sugar at home and it wasn&#x27;t the right consistency, this was the best $17 I have ever spent. I was a little worried from comments where people were complaining.. my only explanation for their comments would be user error. Perhaps they let the product get too hot so it didn&#x27;t grab onto the hair well enough, we may never know. But I do know I am so happy, and empowered that I can do this all on my own and can save so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you&#x27;re on the fence it&#x27;s only $17.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit.  I especially love that it&#x27;s so easy to wash off any excess or misplaced \\&quot;wax\\&quot;.  And it&#x27;s super effective, once you figure out the ideal temperature (if you try to start when it&#x27;s too hot, it won&#x27;t work).  I also love that you can just wash off the cloth strips and use them again! But there is definitely a learning curve involved, so be prepared to spend some time.  And, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you may have patchy legs the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I was reading the reviews(only the first couple of pages) thinking that this would be good, so i ordered it, As soon as i got i was happy thinking it would work. As soon as i heated it and start putting on my legs it was so messy and sticky. It didnt come with good instructions either so i didnt know how long to keep it on or what, cause im a first time waxer i had no idea. I didnt get the wax off the first time with the strip so i had to keep doing it and at times it was painful. The wax does not come off easily either,it was literally stuck on my leg, i had to keep washing it off maybe i did not do it right but it would have been more helpful with detailed instructions for people who have never used before. never again will i use this product. The only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was fast shipping</li>
            <li> I guess I just need to learn how to use it properly.  The warm product wouldn&#x27;t spread easily.  As soon as it hit my skin it got all mealy not at all like warm honey.  I&#x27;ll practice more but I&#x27;m not enthralled.</li>
            <li> Did not really remove hair very well for me, I tried different techniques to no avail. You will probably need a warmer because it solidifies so fast.</li>
            <li> I used to get waxed about once a month, but since I moved to USA, this lifestyle was no longer affordable. I wanted to continue waxing so I purchased this as my first self waxing kit and I could not be happier with the results. If you follow the instructions to detail, you will get great results with very minimal pain or discomfort. I will definitely continue using this.</li>
            <li> I would come back to this product. It&#x27;s been great, and you can use i to get rid of hair of different areas.</li>
            <li> Being a first time waxer, I was down to try this. After reading all of the great reviews, I had no reason not to buy it! I even went and bought extra strips, extra sticks, and a wax warmer. When it finally came time to test the product out, I was shock on how bad it sucked. Even after letting the wax and the strip set for a minute for it to adhesive, when I ripped it off only the wax came off! The hair stayed! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this when there is better products out there..</li>
            <li> I have tried shaving, depilators, epilators and waxing. With shaving and depilators the hair would grown back darker and faster. Using an epilator took too much time. I&#x27;ve tried waxing a salon painful and can get expensive. Waxing strip don&#x27;r work at all. I&#x27;ve tried at home hard waxing kits, it painful, messy and not worth trying again. I read a lot of reviews on Moom before trying it. It wasn&#x27;t painful on my legs at all. It was painful for my underarm since the hair was much thicker. I also tried my bikini line not as painful as imagine since last time I did with traditional waxing and I cried. The hair does take longer to grow but I would not say up to 8 weeks. Th hair does grow back in light. I would absolutely recommend this, if you&#x27;re new to waxing it might hurt but it will hurt a hell of a lot less than with any other. The only negative I have is that it wasn&#x27;t enough. So, I learned how to make it thanks to youtube and haven&#x27;t bought a new pack since.</li>
            <li> When Moon does remove the hair it does it well. The whole hair follicle comes out and it takes a considerable long time to grow (about the same time when you get waxed professionally). The only thing I had trouble with was that majority of the moon wax didn&#x27;t grab my hair follicles, and I had to reapply numerous times; I&#x27;m not sure if I was doing the process wrong but it kept leaving patches unwaxed. Also, I love how naturally pleasing it smells and how it is completely natural and organic! It does not irritate my skin at all (initial redness at first as always but gone in like half an hour). Overall, when it did successfully grab hair, it removed it completely and wholly; however, it does tend to leave patches unless I was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I used it to shape my bushy, out of control eye brows, because I did not want to go to the salon. I was happy the pain was really reduced. I have no fear of pain with this stuff. Plus, the hairs that grow in now, pull out easier and with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think hair removal was better the first time when I did not microwave the stuff. Second time I used it, I heated it up. Or maybe the hairs were not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like using it on my lip area. Pain was not a problem there, it just seemed to remove less hairs, a lot less. Or, maybe the hairs were not long enough?  My upper lip area broke out and is still healing. I will stick to hair removal cream for the lip area. Anyway, I got this stuff mainly for my brows, so no loss there. I like that the strips are reusable. I just run them under water to remove hair and wax.</li>
            <li> Moom is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This  product  did not seem to work not even when I used it on my eye brows. It was quite messy as well but easy to clean up then regular wax. It does seem to be ok on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and fairly new to hair removal and this is the only thing so far that I have ever used, therefore I can&#x27;t compare it to waxing. With that said, this is probably the only product I will ever use for my hair removal needs. I&#x27;ve been using Moom since this past May only on my bikini area, and after reading the instructions I was ready to try it. For the past few months I would start off by trimming the hair and then letting it grow back for a few days. (a little more than a stubble) When I would try and use the Moom  it would remove most of the hair but I had to go over several spots twice to get all of it for a really smooth look. This past month I really didn&#x27;t have time to sugar and  the hair was a little longer than I would usually let it get and thought it would be too long, but I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and do the Moom anyway. It turns out that the longer hair seemed to be the trick. The sugar adhered to 99% of the hairs this time and it only took me half the time that it usually does because all the hair was removed the first time. (from a half an hour down to 15 minutes) So glad that I found that out! Not going to lie, it hurts but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like pain then don&#x27;t wax this isn&#x27;t the product for you. But as a waxing product goes its been pretty gentle and makes my skin very soft after waxing. Its easy to remove in the shower and comes off with just hot water. Can be messy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t works the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my upper lip for years but shaving my legs and bikini area. I got this for my bikini and face b/c i was tired of getting nasty, painful ingrown hairs on my bikini line and the wax really irritates my face. My hair is dark, thick and kinda coarse. It worked great on my face. No irritation afterwords which really surprised me and I thought it was less painful than wax. My bikini line was a bit more of a challenge but I expected that. I had to go over the hairs a couple of times to get all of them and then pluck strays but it was worth the time and effort to not have those horrible ingrowns or bleeding skin from waxing.  I also tried this on my legs and was not as impressed with the results. It took forever and the 6oz jar I bought would not be near enough. If you&#x27;re dead set on waxing your legs with this, just know its gonna be really time consuming and you&#x27;re gonna want to buy a bigger jar. I like that the clean up is so easy and that the strips can be reused. I&#x27;ll probably just stick to moom&#x27;ing my face and bikini area but shave my legs instead.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and it was painful, it didn&#x27;t remove hair completely, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a male, and I bought this product to try to remove hair from my chest and abs. I followed the directions, but after hours of waxing and using up all the included strips, I still had not gotten all the hair off. It took me a few sessions and many hours to finally be hair free, and the hair came back in less time than if I had depilated. If you are a female and you don&#x27;t want to use this on a large area it would probably work, but guys with coarse hair, stay away from this. I have been using epilation and it is much quicker and easier. I am going to try IPL next, but nothing seems to be perfect yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting brazilian waxes for about 4 years. I&#x27;ve tried a few at home waxing kits but I&#x27;ve never had great experiences with them...a lotttt of pain and a lot of sticky mess that&#x27;s very difficult to clean up. But I was getting really tired of spending $50 every month to get waxed professionally so I started doing a little searching and found Moom. I was happy to read that sugaring is gentler because it doesn&#x27;t pull off a layer of skin like waxing does. And I was even happier to read that it is water-soluble so it is much much much easier to clean up than wax. And if you mess up the application you can just wash it off and reapply. You only need to heat it up for 10 seconds, although I did have to pop it back in the microwave towards the end. It is still moderately painful but more tolerable than wax. Moom got virtually all my hairs, minus a few strays that I plucked with tweezers when I was done...even better than the at home waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried. The sugar wax rinsed off the strips easily in warm water and I hung them to dry and use again. I&#x27;m very excited about this product and will definitely be saving a lot of money now! I barely made a dent in the jar, so it will last me quite a while. Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Didn&#x27;t turn my skin red. High quality fabric strips. Washes off quickly, with no mess at all. Taste&#x27;s good too!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating it though .</li>
            <li> I have no experience with waxes or creams or any of those hair removal products other than those for shaving, and I tend to be clumsy and messy with this sort of thing, so I was a little worried about using Moom.  After a couple of practice strips I found this product to be easy to use, easy to clean up, and effecient (even on my stubborn asian hair).  It also didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.  Finally, since the strips are durable and made of thin fabric, I could rinse each strip in a little bowl of water immediately after I used it and it would soon be dry and ready to use again or to be put away.</li>
            <li> works great and not very painful</li>
            <li> Was hoping this product would actually be easy to use.  Maybe I need to try it a few more times but got frustrated at the attempt.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time because (for some reason) ULTA that is in my area didn&#x27;t have an epilator.  I usually use one but since they didnt and i needed to get rid of some unwanted hair, and bought this.  Mostly because I&#x27;m a strict vegan and of course organic, no honey, and no animal testing caught my attention.  I really like this product.  A few things that I would like to tell other people wanting to try it, when the directions say &#x27;10 seconds or until honey like texture&#x27; that&#x27;s IT.  Anything thats more watery wont work as well.  Buying it in the 6oz container 10 or 12 seconds is perfect to start.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, i really like how its water-soluble.  Its so much easier to clean anddd! the strips are washable and reusable!  After i used it, my skin turned normal (from being bright red) in less than 10 minutes.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, like myself.  I highly recommend this product for people who are looking for a waxing product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on most of the hair...</li>
            <li> The wax works it just hurts but i still have not grown any hair back yet and its already been a week ever sence i used it i like this product because everytime you use it you grow less hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly how the package told me to and this product did not work well at all. I tried a few different times, but I still wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. It was painful and didn&#x27;t even remove all of the hair from the few spots I tested on my legs. I also sent the company an E-mail reqesting to return it and they never wrote me back. I will never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> This wax is just OK. All the hairs doesnt come up in one take, i need to try 2-3 times to come up completely! But it does make my skin smooth after waxing. Its not worth. Also, it works for hands and legs. It failed on face(upperlip) and underarm even after trying 3-4 times! I dont have this problem if i use other wax products!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit with scepticism as I don&#x27;t do pain and never waxed before as I have never braved a salon and assumed it would be too difficult to DIY. I really wanted to be hair free for a few weeks whilst on my jollies and the good reviews convinced me to give it a go. I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter and I was stunned with how amazing this stuff is. A timid start on my bikini line and I ended up with a brazilian in less than 30 mins!! A bearable second of pain and all hairs were removed in one go with skin left smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips&lt;br /&gt;I heated the jar in microwave in two 30 second stints stirring in between (I have a low watt microwave) I then placed the jar in a large mug of boiling water so it maintained the honey like consistency for longer. I reheated just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittidly, it was a bit tricky reaching all areas and if you don&#x27;t use the right technique you can break the hair off rather than remove it from the root. I noticed this happened in one patch but I think that will get easier with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used just 5 cotton strips in all and I managed to thinly apply the sugar as advised. I used about 6th of the jar. The sugar washes off the reusable strips n application tools very easily with warm water. I bought 50 extra strips which I&#x27;m glad I bought as I&#x27;ll need more for legs and under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m a total convert. Its Easy, relatively painless and great value for money. Im binning my razor.</li>
            <li> I approached this product skeptically, but I am genuinely pleased at how well Moom works.  Since it was so cheap, it was hard not to give it a try after so many good reviews.  I&#x27;ve never waxed before, and I was impatient so I tried it on 1/2 cm hair.  NO GOOD.  I waited until my hairs were the full 1 cm (as recommended).  WOW.  All those armpits and bikini hairs were gone.  There were some residual shorter ones left behind, but the long nasty ones were gone.  I waited a month to let the hair grow back about 0.75 cm to wax again.  The hairs grew back MUCH finer, in fact, it was hard to even see the hairs in the mirror they were so fine.  My only criticism is for some reason the product did not work on my leg hair as well (like 30% effective at best), though my leg hair is fine and blonde, whereas my armpit and bikini hair is coarser and dark.  I&#x27;m not that worried about waxing my legs though, it was the armpit and bikini hair I wanted to tame and it serves me well.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  I thought why not try this wax since it&#x27;s cheap and well it&#x27;s worth a try with all the great reviews.  I used in on my legs, my bikini, stomach, eyebrows and upper lip.  I was super pleased that I was hair less. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxing I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally done.  I was super excited when I did my bikini area since it did hurt, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it worked well and didn&#x27;t cause irritation like most wax does for my sensitive skin.  I was a little red but not a big deal at all.  It went away within a day.  I already ordered more and already told my best friend to order it!!</li>
            <li> The first time i tried it I was very disappointed with the results because ot didn&#x27;t work at all!!! Then I watched a couple of tutorials online and realized I was doing it all wrong!!!! This actually works when it is done correctly! It is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be razor free! great for the skin as well. It leaves it smooth and clean. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to have my legs waxed professionally for over a year now and its getting a bit expensive for me so I have been wanting to find a diy home waxing kit. I have not shaved since I discovered waxing, so my leg hairs are well accustom to this kind of treatment. I read some of the reviews for MOOM before purchasing and was pleased that there were so many positive reviews. I did read some of the negative reviews but decided that I wanted to try MOOM. I paid around $13 for a complete kit with two different size strips, sticks, instruction booklet, and a glass jar of the sugar solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit arrived in the mail today and I was very excited to try it out. I haven&#x27;t had my legs waxed for about 2 months and the hairs were long enough to wax. After READING THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY THOROUGHLY, I began. The sugar solution needs to be heated up (for 10 seconds in the microwave) just enough so that it is easier to spread on your skin, but not too hot or else it will burn you. When you apply the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; (spreading in the direction of the hair growth) you want to end up with a very thin layer left on your skin. Use the stick to scrape off excess. THIS IS KEY! This way the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; grabs on to the hairs and also is able to adhere to the fabric strips. Place a fabric strip over the area and rub up and down with your palm a couple times to make sure all the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is in contact with the strip. (You don&#x27;t want the stuff to be too warm though, it needs to be solid and sticky enough to pull the hairs out.) Then hold on and yank that bitch in the opposite direction of the hair growth. It worked perfectly for me and I quickly got the hang of it so that the second leg was much quicker and easier. It&#x27;s not too messy and cleans up quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you really need to understand how waxing works and how to apply the solution and all that for this to work properly for you. If you shave the area you are trying to wax, this stuff might not work as well but I don&#x27;tknow because like I said I have not shaved my legs in over a year. I will update this review after I try waxing an area that I normally shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al in all, I really like this product and the results I got from it. I definitely will recommend this to friends and will be buying more of the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; when I run out.</li>
            <li> I tried this with high hopes that it would work for me and it did nothing but give me little red bumps on my chin and upper lip area. I had to heat it a just a bit because right out of the container it wouldn&#x27;t spread at all, but heated just a bit it spread nicely. I followed the directions completely, a couple times, but it wouldn&#x27;t remove the tiny hairs I have. I am not a hairy person so maybe thats the problem, you need coarser hair then what I have. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This sounded to good to be true.  it is extremely difficult to use alone,m effectively.  Unless you have someone you really want to see your most intimate parts, and that, for me is not going to happen..somethings are better left unshown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A PROFESSIONAL WAXER DOES A MUCH MORE THOROUGH JOB AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLY MESSY AND INCONSISTENT EFFECTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a very understandable no return policy on Amazon for this product, I went to Moom itself to get info on shipping it back.  The costs for me to absorb for shipping and offering only a fraction of what I paid to do so, meant I would literally take a LOSS financially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is amazing - truly.  But from my standpoint, Moom (and likely many other home waxing kits are simply not worth the time, mess, and poor results -- beware--you lose $$$ when trying this at home.</li>
            <li> I used it like the directions said, but it didn&#x27;t work. Not one hair removed! It was terrible. All the pain, none of the gain. Also, can&#x27;t be returned. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This is the first waxing product I ever bough,vand also the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried waxing. I am very pleased. It&#x27;s been very effective on facial hair, and not as painful as I imagined waxing would be. The wax doesn&#x27;t need to be hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your skin. The cloth strips are reusable, so you&#x27;re really getting your value out of this product. You may want to look into a candle warmer or something to keep the wax warm, because it becomes hard to spread when it cools off. You have to apply a VERY thin layer of wax, or else it won&#x27;t be very effective, and you&#x27;ll quickly run out of wax. Overall great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing. As a man, I&#x27;ve been shaving the twig and berries for years, twice a week, to keep everything neat and tidy down there. It&#x27;s a pain in the nuts (literally) to nick yourself constantly and I still never feel like I get all the hair. I had a male brazillian once and it was the most painful (and bloody) experience of my life. I left there in incredible pain that didn&#x27;t go away for almost a week. After another guy friend of mine recommended this, I was hesitant but tried it. Incredible! I let my hair grow for 2 weeks so it was 3/8&amp;#34; or so long, applied the sugar to the strips (at room temp) and pressed it into the hair, starting at the top of my man area. I was really nervous when I took the first pull but it worked! Came right off, some discomfort but overall many times easier than waxing!  In more sensitive areas (testicles, for instance), you&#x27;ll want to spread the testicle skin as far to one side as you can and rip the other direction quickly. That should pull the hairs out while leaving the skin intact. The first time I did this, it took about an hour to get it right. Now, I can manscape the whole area in about 20 minutes and it stays good for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product and company!</li>
            <li> Well, sadly i have to use it on my face. But here&#x27;s the good news, unlike other wax products this one does not hurt..  i mean after you use the strip..no other product has to be applied to kill the pain.. As I use the \\&quot;moom\\&quot; stuff more i&#x27;ve gotten better at getting the results i desire.&lt;br /&gt;THIN LAYER..is a tip</li>
            <li> Okay, I never write reviews for anything.. But this product is amazing! I didn&#x27;t buy my Moom wax on Amazon but I got the travel size from Ulta. First off, when I first got this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all! I read reviews about other people saying to warm it up and I did that.. Let me tell you, DO NOT WARM IT UP! It works best in its original form. What I did was I took a little blob of wax and just dabbed it over the hairs, then I put the strip on the wax and just DABBED IT (not smooth it out in direction of hair growth, even though that&#x27;s what the directions say). After dabbing the wax into my eyebrow hairs, I pulled my skin back and peeled off the strip as fast as possible (in the opposite direction of hair growth) and all the hairs literally came out! It didn&#x27;t even hurt at all! This product is great! Not that messy and the strips clean easily with warm water. You can bring it anywhere and not have to worry about warming it up. Amazing buy!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea but it didn&#x27;t work for me ! I thought I had found a convenient way to wax...didn&#x27;t turn out that way.I followed the instructions so not sure what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least I tried it once !</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for the inventors of this product.  Just be careful when using and don&#x27;t overheat in microwave, as I burned my finger the first time using it.  It takes about 30 seconds or less in my microwave to heat.  It is very sticky and just use a warm wet wash cloth when using to wipe off skin or spills.  But when you put it on the area intended the strips will take off all of it. It is not painful and even gets easier each time you use it.  I love the fact you can use the strips over and over again.  And it does not take much just a thin application each time.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have horribly sensitive skin and not only did this only sting minimally it only left me red for a little less than a day (a great improvement over any other hair removal product).  Some people have commented that they did not have a great result with the product but if you read the directions it should work fine.  I did find that the longer the hair the easier the pull and that trimming the hair to a shorter length did not improve the removal.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as an alternative to shaving my legs. I always get bumps and fast regrowth after shaving so Sugaring is my go to. Before I had a baby I would go to a salon to have someone else do it for me, but now I have a baby and need to save money, so I ordered this. First off, it is a great product. It does need to be warmed, I used a wax warmer that I got from a Sally Hansen hard wax kit, it tool FOREVER to heat up. I recommend heating it in a hot water. I love the strips that is came with, its so easy and they are reusable! I would like to see more strips and stick included with the kit, and the jar tends to get really sticky around the edges, hence the 4 stars, otherwise everything was great! The normal bumps and leg redness went away fast overnight and left me with smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried the wax warmers, creams and of course plucking to remove facial hair. This is far better than waxing-unless you go to a professional. The trick is it takes a little practice. Read and follow the directions-it works. Wash face, dry, use the cornstarch and the best time is before bed. By morning even though my lips were red-the next day it was clear and then I took a shower. The strips clean easily with water and wash ASAP after use and let dry flat. By the second-third application I got the technique down. Haven&#x27;t tried on legs-but can&#x27;t be as hard as lips and chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of shaving, have sworn off depilatories (Nair and Veet are EVIL EVIL EVIL to my skin), and am scared of regular wax (microwaveable, pre-waxed strips and the like).&lt;br /&gt;My mom had sworn by Nads in the past, so I was gonna go for that, but this stuff was cheaper and looked to be not only cost effective, but more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the first time the other day on my upper lip (which I&#x27;ve never done before) and WOW, it seriously didn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve used tweezers before, but I really couldn&#x27;t do much &#x27;cause it&#x27;d sting so much my eyes would water, but this stuff was not the case! It didn&#x27;t snag everything, but when I went back with my tweezers THAT DIDN&#x27;T HURT EITHER. I was in awe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sides of my calves are now starting to feel like carpet because I&#x27;m so anxious to try it on my legs that I&#x27;ve stopped shaving and started covering them up(not easy since its summer, mind you). The anticipation is KILLING ME. My boyfriend laughed at me the other day because I seem to be coming up with random other places to wax for the fun of it. Hahaa. I recommend this stuff for sure!</li>
            <li> OK so first off, this is my first time ever waxing or sugar waxing. Takes practice, patience, and pain tolerance lol   i have really REALLY coarse hair so when this stuff pulled it out i was :O i&#x27;m very pleased, but like other people said it doesn&#x27;t get out all the hair on the first time and it is hurtful, my skin reacted weird to it--little red bumpss everywhere-- but i think i just have to get used to it. To sum it up: I definitely recommend this product. I just placed an order for the lavender version. Happy mooming!</li>
            <li> I like this product but I think it is overpriced. Works well but the quantity is small for the price.</li>
            <li> i was veery excited to try the moom hair removal after reading the reviews , when i tried it ( and i was comparing it to nads hair removal gel)  i saw that moom is less painful but that&#x27;s because  messes alot of hair , and i noticed that i causes redness vs nads which was much less    to me i prefer nads much more</li>
            <li> HEY EVERTONE IM TIRED OF SHAVING MY FACE...SO IMA GET THIS...BUT DO I NEED TO BUY A WAX WARMER FOR THIS?..</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again. What a terrible experience!  I was careful to follow directions specifically; however, this product caused hair breakage (instead of pulling out by the root) and the absolute WORST case of ingrown hairs/red bumps I have ever experienced!</li>
            <li> this product is good but i think the price should be like $5, i moomed last weekend at night and my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back yet, it DOES miss hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt! just have ur skin be prepared. afterwards i have little red dots on my skin because of the hair getting ripped out but it disappeared in the morning. so i would recommend to a friend and everyone should use this product! better than waxing and shaving, i never waxed or shaved and Moom is my first hair removal method and i won&#x27;t buy any other product for hair removal (:</li>
            <li> Best Wax I&#x27;ve bought! Spreads smooth and the cloth strips stick better than the heavy paper ones. I like the fact that it&#x27;s in a glass jar instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product and I too was so excited to use it that ones i started I couldnt stop!!! hahah  It is a little sticky and can be diffcult because it is better used when its very warm and doesnt stay warm for very long then you have to go run and microwave it for about 15 seconds. But very nice loved it besides that :)</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome (just be careful not to heat it too much) It didn&#x27;t leave a single hair behind. The reusable strips wash off so easily, and that was a feature I was pretty skeptical about.</li>
            <li> Almost just the same as any other wax, seemed extra super sticky though... I&#x27;d reccommend having a second person to help with eyebrow application, ended up just trashing it because it became too sticky of a situation ...now I regularly get my eyebrows threaded instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be very similar to wax, removing the hair with not too terribly much pain. When I tried it out it had the complete opposite effect, this does not remove the hair very well and is VERY PAINFUL. Yes, this product is natural, but its no fun to bleed copious amounts every time you wax.</li>
            <li> This product did not get all the hair as I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. Now it is just sitting on my shelf. What a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, because we all read the reviews and have to take the most popular statements and decide to go for the purchase or not.&lt;br /&gt;These reviews seem plausible, but truth be told I was able to get maybe 50% of the hair after the second try. I followed all the instructions, and went to Mooms site and watched the video directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t wax all the hair it doesn&#x27;t work!!! I tried my bikini, my lip hair, eye brows, no one area worked and all hair types were different. I have black hair and this should be a the perfect hair to grad with wax.</li>
            <li> i read plenty reviews , and with confidence finally purchased.&lt;br /&gt;i couldnt get it to pull up any hair ... so&lt;br /&gt;i let a licensed cosmetologist do it, thinking i was probably doing it wrong..  and even she couldnt get it to pull up hair.&lt;br /&gt;waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes from this product after looking at the reviews. Verdict - fail! Does absolutely nothing to pull out those hairs, after being applied exactly as per directions. Forget the thicker hair on the legs, this product did not yank out even the think sparse hair on my arms. Absolutely not recommended !</li>
            <li> This product works great and is not painful. It washes away easily with warm water and the reusable strips are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really difficult to use and literally did not remove one hair from my face.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not very good at removing hair.</li>
            <li> As the title says I was very excited to try this product, and really wanted to love it.  An organic hair removal product with reusable applicators is right up my crunchy granola alley!  Unfortunately the product just doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me.  I&#x27;ve tried it unheated, slightly heated, and warm.  I&#x27;ve tried it thin, thick, and everywhere in between.  I followed all the directions from the package and all the miscellaneous suggestions from other reviewers and nothing I do works.  The product works reasonably well for thick hair, but for the thin hairs around my eyebrows and upper lip it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. I&#x27;ve been waxing for years so I highly doubt its my technique, the was just won&#x27;t grab onto those hairs.  Unfortunate, because this seemed like such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love my Parissa strips [[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini 16 Strip(s)]], they&#x27;re much more painful and wasteful, but they work.  So I&#x27;m unfortunately going to have to  continue using those for my face.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair removal product I have ever used!  Thank you MOOM!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found suh a great organic non-toxic hair removal kit. It arrived on time and came with everything listed. Sadly I was a bit disappointed with the products. The first area I tried to wax was my legs and although it grabbed a lot of the hair it still left a lot behind BUT this was my first time waxing my legs so I&#x27;m hopeful that as I continue the product will work more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical; didn&#x27;t think this &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;reusable strips&amp;#34; product would work. Wow, was I wrong! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, using this waxing kit will NOT get you salon results (ie: it does not remove every single hair). However, if you&#x27;re wanting it for low problematic areas, light hair, thin hair, or just an overall hair removal sweep, then this will do the job. I&#x27;m pregnant and bought this kit to wax my stomach, because I hate the hair growth I get from the increase in hormones. Like I said, some light, thin hairs remain after I&#x27;m done but, overall, the appearance is much cleaner and smoother. I&#x27;ve also used this on my toes/feet, lip, and to do a brazillian waxing. All great results - again, not perfect, but pretty close! I was also impressed with the reusable strips. I simply fill my sink up with warm water and stick the strips in as I&#x27;m done using them, along with the wooden applicators, and ALL the wax dissolves easily. I just rinse all the strips and sticks, then leave them to dry. So easy!! The jar of wax included in this kit has lasted me: 2 brazillians, 1 lip, 1 toes/feet, and 3 pregnant belly waxings. Pretty good; can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Unless I did this wrong, this product almost took half of my face off!!! I tried using this product on my arm and was dubious, but when I tried my face, all I could say was Holy Smokes Batman! Guess I&#x27;ll stick to a razor.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s so much better than the other wax i was using before. It&#x27;s basically pain free and super easy to clean up after. I also really love the cloth strips that are reusable. Even my boyfriend loves this product. I just wish it came in a extra strength wax, some hair can be more stubborn than others.</li>
            <li> You can follow the instructions to a T and this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work as well as wax. Better on the skin though.</li>
            <li> I tried Moom&#x27;s sugar wax after a bad experience with regular waxing. I will never go back to shaving again. I love how this is not messy and it rinses off with water. I don&#x27;t think it takes too much time to wax compared to shaving either. You stay hair free for a long time compared to shaving which actually makes waxing save you time in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried waxing before with horrible results.  I thought this would be a nice alternative.  I was wrong.  It was just as painful as waxing and I saw bruising on my legs immediately.  It didnt remove all the hair but it did make my skin red and irritated.  I only applied the product to a part of my leg and couldn&#x27;t even finish the entire leg.  I threw the rest of it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and my wife uses this on my back before we go on vacation.  It works well for me.  I don&#x27;t know if people expect having hair ripped out of your body to feel good but it felt no worse then having this done at a professional spa, which I have done.  It&#x27;s more comfortable to do at home, plus it allows your spouse to inflict pain upon you.  I just wish she wouldn&#x27;t laugh at me as she does it.  It does clean up easily, it&#x27;s sugar based, we even reuse the strips by letting them soak in hot water, rinsing them, and letting them air dry.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and my back hair is somewhere between sasquash and Michael Phelps leaning towards Phelps; we go through a 6oz bottle of this stuff for one waxing and it lasts for my two week vacation.</li>
            <li> it does work.&lt;br /&gt;still a little messy but the process is simple and easy to do. the result is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a simple reminder:&lt;br /&gt;when you apply it to skin, pls wait until it become cold then pull off from skin. if the honey-like thing doesn&#x27;t completely become cold, the effort may not be such good. but after it colds down the effort is very well.</li>
            <li> I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THIS DID NOT WORK OUT SUCCESSFULLY- IT GOT REALLY DRY BEFORE IT CAN HIT THE SKIN. GOT REALLY MESSY- REALLY FAST. LEAVE IT UP TO THE PROS. NOT A DO IT YOURSELF PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have severe sensitivities to fragrances and the Tea Tree choice did not bother my asthma.  Moom removes the hair and&lt;br /&gt;with each use, you become more adept.  You may think that the muslin strips will not be reusable, but they rinse out clean under warm water.</li>
            <li> warmed up for a bit in the microwave and this was the perfect wax.  First time waxing and this was pretty easy to use with little mess.  I also found that it was less painful then I thought.  This wax was also easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Size:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 oz. (170 g) 100% Natural Hair Remover.&lt;br /&gt;18 washable, reusable Fabric Strips&lt;br /&gt;8 wooden applicators (I only got 4.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly, only gave it 4 stars because the description was slightly wrong.</li>
            <li> only used this once &amp; it seems to work good. i guess once i get used to it, it&#x27;ll be better</li>
            <li> So, having decided shaving is not what I want to do, I started waxing about 4 months ago. I had purchased Nad Wax Strips and:    1. They hurt like s***  2. Irritate my skin  3. Remove about 50 -  60% of my fine leg hair.    I have yet to wax any part other than from my knee to ankles, fyi.    Tried Moom. Love the ingredients. Love organic and washable clothes. There really isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t love but here are a few tips:    1. I do not have a microwave. I boiled water in a kettle, poured the water in a bowl, and brought it into the bathroom. I placed the open glass pot of wax in the water. It helped but wasn&#x27;t  hot enough. I put the wax, in the water in front of a small heater. I think I will heat the wax in a pot on the stove as directed and then use the heater to keep it warm. I went through 3/4 of a pot of wax b/c I spread it on too thick. They mean paper thin when they say it. But! It got all the hairs, clean up was simple, and it hurt WAY less. Yeah!    They say you shouldn&#x27;t put anything on your skin you can&#x27;t eat, so this fits in nicely with that. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Groupon and decided to check its ratings before purchasing it to use for an upcoming trip to Jamaica. The reviews on Amazon were good and the price was better on Amazon than on Groupon. So I purchased it with my prime account and received it in 2 days. I tested it out on my arms a few April 5 and as of today, April 17, my arms are still hairless. I&#x27;ll be using it for my legs and bikini area for my trip next month.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with this product. i&#x27;ve tried it several times to give it a chance and still got the same results. it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair and I have to go over the area several times to remove the remaining hair and I still don&#x27;t get all of it. I end up having to shave the rest of it. I definately won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products. I was very excited to use it but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me. That wouldn&#x27;t have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time. However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well. Also it&#x27;s kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you&#x27;re supposed to soak them in water and all the water and wax comes off. I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!</li>
            <li> This product works, but it does not remove all the hair. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair texture, because it&#x27;s difficult for me to find hair removal products that work. It does get quite a bit though, and if I use the product, then shave, I have noticeably smoother legs. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> this works perfectly.  i&#x27;ve used multiple products and i love that the strips are reusable and it&#x27;s all natural.  my skin feels wonderful afterward.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I tried it a few time on my legs and arms and no hair was removed. I read the instructions over and over and did it the right way...still no hair removed. Never again!</li>
            <li> Stick to real wax and skip the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; marketing hype. In order to spread this sugar (thats all it is), it must be sufficiently hot, but of course that ends up burning your skin. If its not hot enough the applicator just pulls on your hairs (like a bandaid on a hairy area), so either way youre out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After burning myself, having hairs ripped instead of pulled out, and patches of clear areas, I gave up on this product and threw it in the trash. Save yourself the trouble and get the real stuff. Im totally unsatisfied with this product but unfortunately cant get my money back.</li>
            <li> I recommend picking up a cheap coaster-style candle warmer to go with your kit.  I picked one up at K-mart for $6 and it heated it to the perfect temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickly and easily removed the trouble hair I no longer wanted.  Sugar based product washed off super easy with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers complaining that this doesn&#x27;t remove fine hairs -- traditional wax won&#x27;t either, it&#x27;s a matter of surface area.  You&#x27;ll need a salon treatment for that, or just shave it until it gets thick and then use the Moom :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with quality of product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using sugar for a long time and everytime I do the pain kills me and I take ao much time to do so. However, this one is prefect! Easy to use and I swear the pain is nothing compared to what I used to feel! The only problem I have with this product is that it&#x27;s expensive for its size! Definitely gonna buy it again and again and again!</li>
            <li> So much better than hard wax!</li>
            <li> Worked well for DIY thing, but it&#x27;s extremely painful for me.</li>
            <li> The instructions make this product sound so unbelievably wonderful. &amp;#34;Unbelievable&amp;#34; is the key word. It is messy, way worse than wax, and it didn&#x27;t work. In the garbage it went.</li>
            <li> Buy Nad&#x27;s!  Nad&#x27;s has better quality cotton strips and it is not necessary to heat in order to spread the product.  I have been using Nad&#x27;s since it first came out.  I thought maybe this would be comparable, but for me it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have never done a self waxing before so after reading reviews I though this would be okay to start. As far as waxing the underarms and Bikini area, it did okay but maybe I was doing it wrong. It worked great on my legs and arms so I guess I will continue to use it for those areas only.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF and just ordered it again! Easy to use. Water soluble. Strips are reusable too! Just soak them in warm water and rinse. I use this for my bikini line but did use it once on my legs when I was unable to go for a regular waxing.</li>
            <li> I normally used the Very prewaxed strips, but in efforts to go more natural and use non toxic ingredients I decided to give this a try. I do have a high pain tolerance, but this is the least painful wax I have ever used. It works awesome too even on the thick bikini area hairs and grabs them all as long as its used properly (a thin strip of wax!). It is a bit sticky, but even when I use the Very strips I always get some wax on my hands anyway. Use some wax removing cream for that though and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I always use Moom, it&#x27;s amazing and works super well.</li>
            <li> Great product just really messy</li>
            <li> I always used the hard blocks of zip wax because it was the only stuff that worked. It hurts though and it goes on thick so a box doesn&#x27;t last too long. Moom works awesome. I have tried so many of the heat up waxes with the cloths and they were awful. This took off all of the hair, first try. I like that you can wash it off if you get it where you don&#x27;t want to with just water. Great product, so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This was used so far to remove excess eyebrow hair. It heated in no time, went on easy and was nearly painless.  I am so glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and its everywhere! Waxing is so expensive and shaving all the time is just a pain. So waxing it is! I love how effect the waxing is and how easy it is to clean up! I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Id give it a zero, but that&#x27;s not an option. I&#x27;m &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; w/a product that I absolutely hate, cuz uthis can&#x27;t b sent back. Anywho, it didn&#x27;t take hardly any hair off. I didn&#x27;t think id ever get the wax off &amp; that was using hot water &amp; soap! Very disappointed. Read the reviews &amp; thought, this will work great! WRONG!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting a feel for this but it does the trick. Make sure you read all of the instructions, DON&#x27;T overheat the wax, I myself haven&#x27;t but think that may be where a lot of the negative reviews come from. This stuff is not wax so it just needs to be warmed a little to soften up. The strips are said to be reusable but mine didn&#x27;t do very well in the wash but I didn&#x27;t think that they really would.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when first purchasing this product, But. Wow! It&#x27;s such a great product! ;D Everything I Moomed, afterwards was baby soft! Buy this product, You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Moom is organic, with sugar (that is warmed) being the primary ingredient.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to put on, and requires less frequent reapplication than shaving.</li>
            <li> It is a nice but not Enough entire body and the price is very expensive</li>
            <li> I have to say I adore this product! For those who didn&#x27;t have a good experience, this is how I use it and it works perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t like oily skin so make sure you exfoliate the area good before using. Then ensure the area is completely dry and oil free, sometimes I dust a little baby powder over the area to ensure all oil is gone. Then I start the waxing. I NEVER microwave Moon, I did once on my first batch and it was never the same after that. So on my next pot I found a better option, I run the warm water into the sink and let the pot sit in the water for about 3 minutes.  This makes the wax have a more honey consistancy and it easier to apply. Another thing that I use is my old Nads applicator stick, it is angled and works better than the wooden stick for the bikini line. As for using it on my eyebrows I use a wooden cuticle pusher to apply the wax because this works better than the sticks provided with the Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who is experienced with wax it doesn&#x27;t mean you are going to have a 100% success with Moom, you have to adjust to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Sally Hansen wax, no heat wax then Nads and Nair all to no avail. I switched to Moom after I was burnt at a salon getting my eyebrows waxed, since then I have had insanely sensitive skin in the area (I am sensitive anyway) but whenever I used heat there I would immediately blister, so I was looking for something hypoallergenic. I found Moom and have never looked back. I have a before, after and 48hr later procedure which I have perfected over time using this product and now get awesome results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are considering Moom just go for it and be willing to play until you get a suitable method for you.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about Moom and I do a lot of outdoor hiking/backpacking/etc where it may be hard to shave my legs for days. And my leghair grows fast, and when it brushes against the cloth of hiking pants it is soooo annoying and irritating. I was scared to try waxing, so I tried this. Things I learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Definitly have it sitting in some sort of warm water bath to keep it the right temperature. It cools quickly, and heats too hot very easily, so once you get it to that temperature that&#x27;s needed, keep it there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The spreader they give sucks. Use a frosting knife used for frosting cakes. Works much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) If you do a lot of outdoorsy stuff like me, you may have banged-up legs (bruises, scrapes, cuts...) and it hurts a lot to pull it off over a bruise, and it hurts to get it into a scrape/cut, and if your scrape/cut is healed up well (mine were...originally) it does rip the scab right off. Really, I assumed it with the scrapes/cuts (I&#x27;m not that dumb!) but I was surprised with an almost healed-up fully small cut being torn open to the point of bleeding (it was almost all the way healed, no scab left even), and the sensitivity of the bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) For me, it really only kept me smooth for about 4 days. But, the hair did grow back a bit slower so I could be good for about 7 days until it bugged the heck out of me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still....in the end, not worth the cost &amp; time unless I specifically had a long trip planned. Shame. I was hoping to get the 3-4 weeks people say they get!</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of my chin hairs that drive me crazy. Did not remove any hair, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I like the glass jar, so after heating it in the microwave you can place it in a bowl of hot water to keep it warm. But I don&#x27;t really like the strips it comes with. I actually like the cheap sugar waxing kit I bought at Walmart better. And because waxing is sooooo time consuming, I think I&#x27;m just gonna throw in the towel, splurge a little and get my professionally done this summer!</li>
            <li> It was messy and painful and did not work all that well.  If you spilled it, it was very difficult to remove. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a Brazilian done by myself for about a year. I have the Gigi kit, and used the hard wax and also a blue one. Every time I use it my skin gets very sensitive for a couple of days, almost untouchable, add to that the fact I get ingrown hair and it is very painful to remove the hair on the soft part of the \\&quot;little girl\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I read a few good reviews and decided to try MOOM. It still looks like normal wax, so it is a little messy but not a big deal. I tried spreading the product on the strip and it is easier to use, but when I applied directly on the skin it removed way better. I warmed up enough to get a runnier consistency but when the wax cooled down and got stickier it worked better.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about the product is if it gets too painful and you don&#x27;t want to pull the hair anymore or you applied to much and realize you won&#x27;t be able to remove the hair you can just remove it and do it again. I had a small wet towel with me so every time I had the product left over on the skin I removed right away before moving on.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that it does not damage the skin like regular wax. With regular wax it would be very painful to try to remove the hair twice from the same spot, but with Moom you can clean up and do it again until you remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It still hurt but not as nearly as bad and I even told my husband that this time I didn&#x27;t even yell.&lt;br /&gt;After I was done I took a shower and my skin was not as nearly as sensitive as with regular wax. It got a little red but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;To wash the tools I let water run until the wax get softer and rub it off with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The container that comes with the kit is small, so I used about 1/5 to do the whole Brazilian + underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use regular wax anymore, this is a nicer product that hurts less, smell delicious and causes way less damage than the other waxes. If it gives me a big problem with ingrown hair I will come back to update my review.</li>
            <li> I was not successful in getting this product to remove the hair. Cannot say that it&lt;br /&gt;would or would not work for others.</li>
            <li> Great organic wax that somehow doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other waxes, even professional waxes. Did not make me break out much (which is very common every time I wax my upper lip). Only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t come with enough strips.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised and I think the hair is not growing back as much.</li>
            <li> took me awhile to get it right but after you figure it out it actually works and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as waxing. you do have to let your hair get pretty long for it to work well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product because you can wash the strips over and over again! The wax comes off fairly easily. Waxing hurt a lot less with this product than with others. I will definitely buy this again! You don&#x27;t need to use as much product to get the job done either! That&#x27;s another nice feature!</li>
            <li> it works very good. smooth and clean but i would prefer if there is more strips it would be better</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom for her birthday, she loves it. She keeps recommending it to me; but I don&#x27;t have the guts to wax on my own yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It hardly hurt from the first use, and it hurts less and less each time you use it. If you put it on and either don&#x27;t like where you put it or chicken out (hey, it happens to all of us), just put some warm water on it and it disappears.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy, great money saver to wax at home!</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter to remove hair . she did not want. it works . but there has to be a better way</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with anything like waxing. I usually just use Sally Hansen hair remover cream for my upper lip. I absolutely love Moom!!! I will admit my first yank of the cloth was very surprising...I did not expect that much pain! But it is very effective at removing hair. I had to go over each side three times to make sure I got it all, but I figured with practice I&#x27;ll get better. My upper lip is a little bit tender, but I loved how easy it was to wash off the remaining product. When I was finished I washed the applicator and the cloths. It was so easy!! It actually has made me think about using Moom on my legs or under my arms. I had bought this just for my upper lip, but I really like it and I love the results. I will have to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back, but right now I think this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong...but none of these waxes seem to work for me.  I followed the instructions, and got smooth skin, but no hair removal.</li>
            <li> As far as wax goes, the product seems great. I have really sensitive skin and I only reacted mildly for a short time. (Other waxes cause me to react for days!)</li>
            <li> I was worried when I purchased this item. I have very sensitive skin. Every other hair remover I&#x27;ve tried made my skin break out in a rash and they wouldn&#x27;t even work. Moom didn&#x27;t do that at all. It&#x27;s a little messy but clean up is easy. It removed all the hair. I have thick dark hair. It didn&#x27;t last up to two months. It lasted just over a week. But my hair grows extremly fast. It may last longer after continued use. And I&#x27;m sure it will last longer for others. It is something I reccomend and will use again and again!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! Every time I pulled off a strip, I had to stop and say WOW! I was so impressed that I did my upper lip, legs and bikini line. I haven&#x27;t tried waxing for probably 2-3 years, but this is so much better than that ever was. It gets more hair, it&#x27;s easier to cleanup, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad...and I&#x27;m even near my time of the month which should make my bikini area all the more sensitive. I got such great results, and I&#x27;m probably more inexperienced at hair removal than most.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. I was nervous trying it at first because of some of the one-star reviews, but I was very pleased. It&#x27;s probably different for every person, and I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> First time, right out of the jar - worked like a charm, removed hair exactly as is should.  Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would work, because, if it did, everyone would be raving about it.  I need a product that will remove the hair from my face while it is still in the stubble stage.  This might work for hair that is longer, but if you didn&#x27;t want hair in an area, why would you let it get that long before removing it???  This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I was using another famous brand (Nads) and was very happy about it. One day I ordered this Moom Hair Removal because I needed to order some more to get \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; ordering online.  I think I just liked the name and color, and I was just curious also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, there are differences between this and another product. This one is less sticky and easier to clean up after. Especially when the wax was on the skin, wiping off was harder with the other product. Also, when I wash the wax off the cotton sheet that is used for hair removal, the wax comes off easier than the other products. Another important difference is that removing hair with this product is less painful than using the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I never look back. I don&#x27;t expect that there is any better product on this planet for hair removal with this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your room is very warm you don&#x27;t have to heat the wax before using it. I live in a tropical city (Miami, Florida) so I never heat it.</li>
            <li> I was looking into buying Nad&#x27;s, but only read bad reviews. One of the women suggested Moom instead; cheaper and less messy. Well, the \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; ingredients also got me convinced and truely, the best waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had! Washed right off and doesn&#x27;t remove any skin layers... I was expecting my legs to be puffy, red and itchy for a few days, buy NOTHING. For having not waxed in over 5 years, it didn&#x27;t even hurt that much, I almost can&#x27;t wait to do it again!... Greaty buy!!!</li>
            <li> Moom + a magnifying mirror &#x3D; the best investment I&#x27;ve made in years! I have coarse facial hair. I&#x27;ve waxed, threaded, and even had laser hair removal and all of them have left me unsatisfied. This product is a godsend. It takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you do, it is super-effective and VERY easy on my sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t have to keep heating and re-heating like at home waxes and it&#x27;s 100% water soluble, so you can wash and re-use the strips and also get it off of your face/hands without any trouble. I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> We have been purchasing this for almost two years or more now and are always happy with the results and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have never done waxing at home. The only waxing I&#x27;ve ever done was my eyebrows at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moom was fairly easy to use. It is indeed a bit messy, but I found it the most effective when heated to a smooth consistency. When it was colder/harder it pulled at the hairs and was difficult and painful to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of tries to apply the wax correctly and for it to adhere to the hairs, but it was far less painful than I had expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review approximately 3 weeks after I waxed my underarms and the hair is much sparser and finer. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this product. :)</li>
            <li> i tried this product in three areas my legs, underarms, and upper lip....&lt;br /&gt;The product left behind a good amount of hair in all of the areas. The hair on my legs and upper lip is really thin and not very noticeable but it was long enough( i made sure of it) however i had to apply the Moom several times on my upper lip for it to remove a good amount of hair  but i still had to pluck a bit afterwards it removed little to no hair on my legs. The hair on my underarms is a bit more coarse and it was long enough however I had to reapply several times. I am a new user to waxes and sugar waxes so maybe it&#x27;s inexperience but I did try to follow the directions to the tee and i have waxed about three times with the product. If their are any pros it&#x27;s the nice smell, the reuasble strips, and the easy clean up, however I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Realizing that I wanted to upgrade my appearance I decided that, instead of shaving day, after day, after day and getting the red bumps that come with it, I would try Moom. It sounded good, looked easy enough...why not?  Okay..after trying it, following directions to the letter, and keeping an open mind...I now KNOW ..&amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;.  First of all I&#x27;m a man that wanted to clean up his chest and other areas and not have to do it all the time. I&#x27;m also someone that doesn&#x27;t mind pain (I thought), especially when it&#x27;s necessary to accomplish a goal I want to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;So, I received the Moom, reread the directions a few times, and went for it. Oh man!!!! To say that it hurt is like saying that the Pope is Catholic.  DAMN!!!  Even though it was bad I KEPT saying, go on...finish it. And so I did. However, even when I finished, pain and all, when I looked at it...there was still stubble and I could see it through the red in flammed skin. According to the directions, it will get better each time you apply the product, THAT will never happen again. I&#x27;ve decided that it is much easier, faster, and less expensive to just buy lighter fluid and a Bic lighter and be done with it. The pain would  be about the same either way. No, no more Moom for me.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I am very familiar with waxing. At first I tried applying Moom at room temperature (as a reviewer suggested it is best applied so). I found the wax too thick to apply, and found it even more difficult to spread. I even tried spreading on the strip and then attaching it to my leg: same thing. I heated it for 10 seconds in the microwave, still seemed pretty thick, so I gave it 5 more seconds. It looked more runny, OK. Then comes the mess and the spills. When it is finally spread thoroughly yet only a thing layer (as per directions), as I pulled in the opposite direction of hair growth, barely any hair came out! I waited 2 weeks after shaving, I trimmed to 1 cm any hair I saw longer than that, I had taken a warm bath at least 45 minutes before trying Moom, I applied a thin layer, I only quickly rubbed 3 times over the length of the strip, waited a few seconds, held the skin taut and ripped oft the stop as I have always done before hundreds of times with other wax lines (which have all worked fine for me). But with Moom, barely any hair came out, if any. But it did hurt. A lot. I really wanted it to work, I was trying it out to find and alternative to the other waxes, but I ended up using what was left over of my Sally Hansen kit to finish what Moom could not. I really wish I could have my money back.</li>
            <li> Just painfully pulled hair, did not remove anything!</li>
            <li> I started using this almost a year ago (and I still have about 1/4 of a jar left) and for a while I followed the package directions. It definitely worked by those directions, actually a lot better than the product I&#x27;d used before this. The fact that sugar is water soluble makes clean-up way easier. I have yet to need soap when dealing with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I read an Amazon review from someone who used MOOM cold -- i.e. room temperature, she didn&#x27;t heat it up first -- and liked it better that way. When I tried it her way (I didn&#x27;t heat the wax up and recently stopped using the pre-treatment oil) it works so much better. It gets more hair in one go, it&#x27;s easier to work with, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. Note that I use this on some very sensitive areas, so less pain is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I recommend using MOOM:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t heat the wax up. Spread it pretty thinly at room temperature onto a small strip of cloth, leaving some room to hold on.&lt;br /&gt;2. Place the waxed strip on wherever you&#x27;re hairy and press in, making sure to rub the back of the strip back and forth a few times. If you let the wax warm up too much, it&#x27;ll pull less hair out.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hold your skin taught and rip the strip off. Repeat as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you might want to buy some wooden craft sticks or tongue depressors from your local crafts section, because if you&#x27;re waxing a small area, the couple of sticks that come in the package won&#x27;t last you nearly as long as the jar of wax.</li>
            <li> Eh leaked all over before I even got to use it and didn&#x27;t work for me.., had to throw it out</li>
            <li> Great product. Superior to other &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; hair removers as it is much easier to use (but read the directions!), less messy, and no toxic ingredients. After you get the starter kit, you can re-use the cloths so ordering just the hair remover itself is even more cost-effective. Also pleased with Moom&#x27;s facial hair remover kit.</li>
            <li> The only wax I will use from now on!!!  This stuff is easy on and easy off causing me hardly any pain.  I love the washable cloth strips (that I re-use each time).  Also, it cleans up and washes off RIDICULOUSLY easy!  Very affordable.  An absolute MUST HAVE for anyone wanting to do their own waxing!</li>
            <li> 3 stars because I received the product earlier than expected. Rest of the review after trying moom organic hair removal.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 3 years now and it still works wonders. Like waxing but without the pain! I love my moom hair remover!</li>
            <li> OK! The first time I used this product I did not follow the instructions and no hair was removed - the whole process was messy and full of disappointment. I initially gave up on this and almost threw it in the garbage as wasted money.  I reluctantly went back to using Veet and razors.&lt;br /&gt;One day, while inspecting my new growth I decided to give it another try and to my surprise it worked, almost perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;The key to using Moom is to find your own &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34; with it.  While I read the instructions and understood everything, trial and error did it for me.  I did not measure the length of my hair follicles with a ruler (who does that?).  The first time my hair growth was about a month long and I realized that may have been one of the reasons it did not work.  This time my hair growth was about 1-2 weeks. The other reason it didn&#x27;t work the first time is that I followed instructions and only warmed it for 10 seconds at a time which did not bring it to a state for spreading for me - it was still too tough for me to spread out to a paper thin state.&lt;br /&gt;This time around I warmed it for 20 seconds at a time which made it really nice and runny so that, while hot (manageable for me) I was still able to almost perfectly spread it paper thin and do the rest as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was my first time really doing it successfully, I did it in small sections at a time so it was rather time consuming, but I was totally satisfied with the end result to not think about the time it took to get there.  I know with more practice I&#x27;ll eventually reduce the time.&lt;br /&gt;I am now working on perfecting the bikini line, and even considering a brazillian (lol).&lt;br /&gt;The pain is no different from having your eyebrows plucked, waxed or threaded.  The pubic hair region is a little more painful than the underarms, but after a while I really did not feel it because I was more focused on getting the hair removed than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you are tired of new growth within 2 days from razors, constantly get burned from Veet/Nair, and you are open to something different.  Like I said, it will be messy, it&#x27;s a trial and error, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a clutz. I don&#x27;t have the coordination God gave a drunken 3 legged blind elephant. However, I can use this. I followed one other user&#x27;s recommendation and put the stuff on the strip, then applied it..ZIP..off came the hair. I don&#x27;t think I had heated it up enough, because I did have to go over the area a few times. I didn&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m kind of afraid to get it too hot. It&#x27;s kinda messy getting it out of the jar, but I&#x27;m sure those of you who are more experienced or coordinated won&#x27;t have an issue. It really is nicer to be able to do this at home without worrying about the wax dripping down your eyebrow and causing you to wax off half an eyebrow. Yes, I did that before.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use. Natural scent. Washes off easily with water. Skin is very smooth after using remover.</li>
            <li> I bought this and am pleasantly surprised that it worked really well on my legs.  usually the hair starts growing the day after shaving so something like this is great.  however, I tried my underarms and bikini area and I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  the wax/sugar would not come off.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was because I couldn&#x27;t handle the pain so I couldn&#x27;t pull it off fast enough.  either way, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money for getting my legs done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any hair removal method other than shaving. But recently, I noticed some thin hair growing over my upper lip, and I decided to get rid of it. When I searched prices for waxing in saloons they all ranged pretty high. Then I read about this product, and when I saw only 4 completely natural organic ingredients on it, it was love at first sight. At 12 dollars for the kit, I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I had absolutely not experience waxing or sugaring. The kit has a glass container with 6 oz of product, about 10 or more long fabric strips, a few little strips, and wooden sticks. I used the whole container in my &amp;#34;girlstache&amp;#34; and part of my legs (up to the knees). But I wasted some because of my lack of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie: It hurts! But the pain lasts 2 or 3 seconds, and the results are outstanding! Smooth exfoliated skin. I did leave some hair behind on my legs, but they are sparse and not noticeable. As for my upper lip: 100% hairless. Although it took me many intents. Also I had a slight irritation on my upper lip after all (I imagine from pulling the hair off a place for the first time), I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggests to watch the videos on how to use the Moom sugaring, and keep the treated areas hydrated and protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Easy to use, absolutely no pain, job is done in minutes and wash away the wax with water. On top of it its organic, highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This was the second time I tried waxing at home. The first was with a drugstore brand and was disastrous. I was a little skeptical about this but gave it a try anyway. It heats up quickly in the microwave and stays at a nice consistency long enough for you to finish waxing. It also comes with everything you need. This worked well for me even on course hair and was not so painful. Also it was extremely easy to clean up- it washed right off with just water. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver when it comes to hair removal. I have pretty coarse hair, which it isn&#x27;t great at removing when the hair is stubbly. But if I let the hair grow out a bit, this works like magic. I heat it up on a coffee warmer (a must, I&#x27;ve never gotten it quite right any other way. Leaving it on the warmer keeps it at just the right consistency) and cut the longer strips in half so that I have more pieces to use in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Everything is reusable. I either run everything under hot water or let it sit in a pot of hot water for a bit, and it all washes right off.&lt;br /&gt;2. Very gentle, and all natural ingredients. I HAVE bled from it (warning!), where very small spots of blood appeared where the hair was removed. My skin was very dry, however, so, I&#x27;ll take the blame on that one. Be careful when your skin is dry or you&#x27;re using it on a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;3. One pot lasts me a real long time. Months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spread it thin. Don&#x27;t use it until the consistency is right (like honey) so that you can spread it out. Pull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. If it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at first, don&#x27;t try over and over again (like I did the first time with stubblies). It&#x27;s not going to get any better. Wait for the hair to get longer.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s not painless, but it doesn&#x27;t feel anywhere as painful as waxing.</li>
            <li> I Followed the directions and the product does not work. Do not waste your money, you are unable to return.</li>
            <li> It just does not pull any hair. I have tried it so many times, following instructions to the tee. Nothing. Ended up throwing it out. I really wanted to love it as I would much rather prefer to use a product with less chemicals, etc. But no luck with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only ever tried waxing my upper lip with those tape-like strips before. Boy did those hurt! So after reading a bit about Moom, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not completely painless, but a million times better than the wax strips. Definitely heat it up in the microwave vs in hot water, though be careful it doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Give it a good stir and apply a thin layer to the area to be waxed. Make sure to lay it in the direction of the hair to be removed, then lay the strip over it. Rub in the direction of the hair to make sure it covers it all, then pull in the opposite direction to take the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of these is that you just need to wash the strips in water and you can reuse them again once they&#x27;re dry. I feel more environmentally conscious than throwing away a bunch of strips with my hair on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only ever used these on my upper lip and eyebrows, however at some point I&#x27;m looking to use it on my bikini line and legs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 5 years and it continues to be easy to use and worth its price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a baby, but I couldn&#x27;t get used to this pain. At first I microwaved it, and although it didn&#x27;t seem hot, it was and I burned my skin, now that is my own fault, but still. I waited all that time before for the hair to grow out and it didn&#x27;t really pull all of the hair out. I had to go back over some spots, which caused more pain. I had intended to try it out on my legs first, then graduate to the bikini area because I get some uncomfortable ingrown hairs and irritation, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the leg pain and only did one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, however, I only had to shave 1 leg for about 3 weeks, which was nice enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know it hurts, and if it truly is less painful than waxing, I could not handle that either. Also, it was messy.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for those who work with this kind of material at the hair salon... however for those who are not familiar with this or for those who are first time, this might really be a little though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You actually have to listen to the instructions. Never ever do it without reading the instructions ( I can tell you by experience). I tested in both ways (without heat and with heat) and it came out decently good. I am a first timer and the first couple of times were though to do, one of the reason why I said that is great for those who are already good with this hair removal technique.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and their customer service is non-existent! awful! it is messy, sticky, I tried everything like the box said, I google it, and still wouln&#x27;t work. I got no hair out but I got some blood! yep! awful! stay away!</li>
            <li> Product was sticky and fairly messy, It didn&#x27;t apply smoothly because I don&#x27;t believe it was warm enough even though I followed the directions precisely. It ultimately removed about half the hairs, at best. Even upon repeated application I could not get all of the hairs as I normally would with regular wax. Pretty disappointed with the product...won&#x27;t be repurchasing Moom again.</li>
            <li> Getting older, means getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except in the case of facial &#x27;granny whiskers!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product , and happy not to have to spend time in the mirror, plucking hair off my chin with a pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a high-maintenance girl, but once I hit my 40&#x27;s , I would have the occasional longer hair grow on my upper lip, or chin.&lt;br /&gt;Not attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Moom is easy to use. Affordable. Results are quick, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product, but nope. After going over an area half a freaking dozen times, I gave up. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Crappy wax won&#x27;t pull any hairs.</li>
            <li> I had what I thought was darkness on one side of my upper lip.  I could not see any hairs.  On the other side, I did have a few that I kept using tweezers to pull out; then they grew back in a week or 10 days.  Sometimes I felt like I was competing with my husband on the mustache thing :).  Anyway, I bought this and gave it a try this past Friday.  I warmed the wax for a short time in the micro wave and spread it on thinly.  I applied the strips and waited for a short time then pulled it off.  I did half the upper lip first, then the other.  Wow, to my surprise, no dark area anywhere!  The few hairs I did see before were on the strip and the dark area, I saw nothing on the strip but no darkness on my face any longer either.  Wow, I feel like a woman again!  This is the first time I have used a wax so we&#x27;ll see how long it works.  I am really happy with this product.  For a few hours afterwards I did feel a little irritation, but it was gone by afternoon.  For only needing it on the upper lip area, this jar will last me years to come.</li>
            <li> WOW! I am so excited to have found this. I just received the product, and just did my eyebrows. For the past 10+ years I have gone to get my eyebrows waxed about 1-2 times per month, but was looking for something to help cut down on that expense. Since I am familiar with the waxing process (have tried waxing on legs, underarms etc as well as the experience of having it done so many times) it was VERY easy to do!! All of the great things about wax but without the negatives- it really does wash off with water, and I used to often leave where I&#x27;d get my eyebrows done with still sticky eyebrows. Just one time getting them waxed cost me around $12 ($25 if you go to a &#x27;salon - I usually just pop into the nail places in the mall, etc.) and I got this entire kit for just over that same amount. Another problem I was having recently from getting waxing done was skin irritation and breaking out. Too early to tell with this but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will be  a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO thrilled to discover this product - thank you, thank you makers of MOOM for this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying this on other body parts - probably underarms will be my next test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you MOOM! Thank you Amazon for great service! I would give this more stars if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a bonus that you get to reuse the strips - cost and eco effective.</li>
            <li> This product removes hair without damaging skin and very little pain.  It takes a couple of tries to get the trick, but if you follow the directions carefully you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> used this under my arm and this was literally no pain... tried the bikini area and that&#x27;s a different story</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use to wax my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Always use on CLEAN, DRY skin, and also use baby powder beforehand.  Your skin should be white from that amount of baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Separate into smaller sections; for underarms, I do one half downward (lower half), the other upward, and one more for the entire armpit upward.  That means the direction in which the wax is applied, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Pull strip in the opposite direction as the wax was applied at a 45 degree angle quickly.  Try to hold the rest of the skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it isn&#x27;t pulling the hair out, then it&#x27;s because a) it&#x27;s not hot/heated enough - where you can put it back in the microwave for another 3 seconds or so - this will not work dry; b) the strip is not being removed quickly enough.  FASTER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything wrong with this product.  It does get sticky because well... it&#x27;s wax (oh yeah, and rinses off completely with water... not the end of the world here) - if you try hard enough it will not drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise it will work!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, so I bought it and &#x27;hoped&#x27; it would work out for me to tidy up my brows and such between visits. I was very surprised at both how well it worked and how easy it was to keep a nice brow line. The package includes both large and small sticks as well as large and small strips (though not enough of them - but fortunately I have a bunch of strips a friend gave me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller sticks made it very easy to create a fairly precise line in the arch of my brows without worrying about accidents, something that is fairly easy to screw up and in my opinion is what brow pencils were made to hide (at least when I do them). It is a nice thick consistency at room temperature and based on that thins out with just a very little bit of warming. The consistency would be great for grabbing hold of very stubborn hair and I can see where this would beat other common brands. My hair isn&#x27;t that stubborn (thank goodness) but I can see where this product would work well where other, more common products may not. All in all I&#x27;m impressed with the product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burning feeling. Other types of waxing make my face break out, but not this one. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It has everything you need in the box. Easy to use and easy to clean. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Less painful than waxing and a lot more effective than other methods of hair removal.  This is something that I&#x27;ll keep up with.  Can be a bit messy though.</li>
            <li> I love that this is water soluble!  Also the linen strips are reusable!  Great for brazilian waxes.  This product is also great for 1st time users because if you get it on your clothes, furniture, or excess amount on your skin it simply rinses off.  Would recommend this product to professionals or first time users.</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I use it on my underarms, I have thickness hair that I usually get waxed but because I need to do it regularly I thought I&#x27;d try to find a more cost effective solution. This sugar wax is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, easy to remove (with water!) and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular wax. It is a bit sticky so you might want to get someone to help you.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I tried a number of different waxing products. Hard wax, soft wax, wax strips. I was happy with the end results but they were such a mess and I hated having to constantly reheat them. I looked alternatives and found sugaring. I was ecstatic! Same results but once I was done, I just hopped in the shower and rinsed the sugar off with warm water. Its so easy to use. It can be done at room temperature. I was in love. Until, I looked at the ingredients! If you have the items to make lemonade, you can make this yourself. And it is so incredibly easy. And a fraction of the cost! All you need is two cups of sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of water. (You can add a couple drops of tea tree oil and chamomile but don&#x27;t really notice a difference.) Mix it together and bring to a boil. Once its boiling, bring it down to a simmer and let it cook for 20 minutes until its a deep brown. Move it to an airtight container and let it cool. It will give you the EXACT same results!</li>
            <li> For those of you girls out there that have a great, thick head of hair but have problems with other areas of your body, I&#x27;m one of you, buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with arm hair too.&lt;br /&gt;But anyways, I shave most of my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I want to switch to Moom for my legs yet. I bought Moom to do the bikini area. And this is the most wonderful item there is. I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing at how astonished I was at the results of this. My pubic hair is coarser than average, like the rest of the hair on my body. Because I have such coarse hair, I was very sure waxing would hurt like hell even though I&#x27;m a good bearer of pain. I decided to try this and IT HURT LIKE HELL. hahah. But it works. And I&#x27;m sure waxing would&#x27;ve killed me maybe.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works like magic. Again, because I have such coarse hair, I bled a little bit, and I stopped after 30 hairs or so. It&#x27;s so painful. But the pain really isn&#x27;t avoidable for coarse hair like mine. I didn&#x27;t microwave it, I just used it at room temperature and it worked fine. I&#x27;ll update this review once I gather up the courage to rip off all the hairs in my pubic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S It is so great to see the root of the hairs on the strips. I \\&quot;wow\\&quot;ed and laughed because it was so amazing.</li>
            <li> Good, and you can use many times without risk. Good and safe, for people who have no time to go out, you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time last night. Here are my observations and pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations:&lt;br /&gt;- Roughly 20% of the hair on the test portion of my chest was left behind after one strip&lt;br /&gt;- Room temperature was not sufficient for spreading easily on the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Strips and sticks are easily cleaned&lt;br /&gt;- A good amount of hair was easily removed&lt;br /&gt;- No sticky residue is left behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not all of the hair in one area is removed with just one strip&lt;br /&gt;- The process was incredibly painful, more so than what I expected&lt;br /&gt;- A huge rash from irritation has formed on my chest and just wearing a shirt today is painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed, but I&#x27;m not disappointed. It gave me the same result every other solution has. I plan to wait and see how long it takes for the irritation to clear up. If it lasts for more than a day, I&#x27;m not going to use this product again.</li>
            <li> This starter kit was a great value! It gives u everything u need to try out the product, which I ended up loving, and it&#x27;s a great price :-)</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this product I tried it. The wax gets extremely hot very fast, so be careful. I actually ended up burning and blistering my skin the first time I used this product because the wax was so hot. I would advise that if you buy this product you do take heed to the directions. Expedient shipping! I received it the very next week after I ordered it. Excellent product, and excellent sellers.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman who has only heard about waxing...and the first to admit there is a huge learning curve involved with usage of this product.  Ladies, do not expect assistance from your &amp;#34;better half&amp;#34; - mine grew wide eyed and ran out of the house when I sweetly asked for some help here.  The major hurdle is the temperature - Moom, I would pay extra for one of those temperature thingys etched into the side of the glass jar.  I finally tried the microwave and found one minute to be too hot and 20 seconds too cool for me.  When at last I could hold the jar comfortably in my hand, I gathered the included wooden spatula and dipped into the goo -  ladies, it is like trying to dip honey with a stick.  This stuff cools fast but I eventually got the syrupy liquid on my face and the cloth strip applied - three pats and it was rip off time.  The second learning cure involves when to scream - first time there was a bit of a shock, a delay and then the audio portion began.  Next strip a little better with a slight groan and shriek afterwards.  Getting a little addictive, the third try elicited a growl from beginning to end.  There was hair left on the strip but I was not sure about the face as my eyes were watering too much for a good look.  I think it worked as my face felt better.  Being an excellent cook (which helps) I did an immediate clean up of the counter, the sink and the floor and left the strips to dry.  Not a bad product - could use that temperature gauge thingy though.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull all hair, but is okay if u into waxing.  i wasn&#x27;t really a fan to messy, i rather use an epilator or shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. It can&#x27;t grab onto the fine hair. Not effective</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on my underarm hair! Left my skin soft and lighter skinned. A bit painful but waxing is far more painful. Just run it under hot water for a while. gonna try it on my legs next. Good luck</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel completely fair to deduct from my rating when the product does what it says it will do. The problem is, as much as I wanted to use and love this product, the kit is almost impossible to use.  It will remove hairs, but you will probably end up with patchy skin hair as you wait a couple of day to go back to your old remover. For one thing, it is very difficult to achieve a consistency that allows for an easy spread of the sugar.You have to heat it for about 15 seconds before it can be soft enough to use, at which point the mixture is too hot to apply. The application sticks did not help, as they take large bits, and clumps to whichever hair it first attaches to. It was a messy and painful process, and I quit halfway through. On the plus side, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bits that cleave onto your skin even after a shower as it is just natural sugar. This product would be much more useful if it came as pre-treated strips to be applied out of box. Others may however not find the application not as impossible as I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It said it suppose to be painless. This stuff hurts, unless I&#x27;m not pulling it right.</li>
            <li> Been using this wax for years, and refuse to even consider using an alternative product.  This is superb for bikini area waxing, that&#x27;s pretty much all I use it for since I use an epilator for larger surface areas (arms, legs).  I once made the mistake of buying a &amp;#34;brazilian wax&amp;#34; product 7 years ago that was some weird slimy green stuff that self adheres to the body, it was rubbish and didn&#x27;t lift a hair.  Stick to the gold standard in hair removal - classic old sugaring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (attempted to use) this product several times, each time hoping the amount of hair that would be removed would be greater.  I&#x27;ve used it at varying temperatures, but this product removes very little hair.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my eyebrows, neck area, and underarms to no avail.  I won&#x27;t be re-ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Great products will defintely come back here again in the future and i recommend this products. Overall it&#x27;s painless and effectness</li>
            <li> I was spending $25-30 every month for a very conservative bikini wax. Four months ago I spent $12 on this product and haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s very easy to use, nontoxic, and, best of all, very easy to clean up. Unlike wax, this just washes away with a wet washcloth. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to home wax with a wax-based product, because I&#x27;d be worried I&#x27;d ruin my linens. Not so with this. I can see what other reviewers mean that it&#x27;s so easy, it makes you want to wax it all!</li>
            <li> So. It works very well if directions are followed. Also not recomended to do it yourself without a mirror. Sharing is caring so have someone help you. More fun is less painful.</li>
            <li> worked okay .. but ouch- ripped my skin off on my upper lip. i should have probably done a test area first. it didn&#x27;t rip skin off in other places i tried later though, the upper lip is just really sensitive and i had red spots for 2 weeks until it healed. i am kinda meh on this product. good part is it is easy clean up and it does work for the most part (not as well on stubborn bikini hairs though)</li>
            <li> Moom is awesome!! Easy steps, not hugely painful and clean up was a breeze! Note: you need a LOT less product than you think. This stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using moon hair removal wax for 3 ears since I first read about it in The Green Beauty Guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s superior to waxing with chemical laden wax or using chemical hair dissolving creams. It&#x27;s so gentle on your skin and washes right off with warm water, do it is super easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my legs and underarms, just be sure your hair isn&#x27;t too long. This is true for any method of hit waxing: hair length should not exceed 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil in Moom prevents ingrown hair! Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this stuff.  It sounds wonderful!  Less mess and gentler on the skin!  But none of that matters if it does not actually remove all the hair.  I followed the directions exactly.  (No, really, I did!)  I thought I might get better with practice.  I tried over and over again for months.  And still, it leaves behind 25%-50% of the hair on my upper lip.  My hair might be slightly more tenacious than average, but not THAT much worse.  The people giving this stuff rave reviews either have the wimpiest hair on the planet, or they&#x27;re paid to post fake reviews.  I&#x27;m asking for my money back.</li>
            <li> I think for someone who&#x27;s had lots of experience with waxing would enjoy this product. Unfortunately, the first couple of times it worked great but then after that it didn&#x27;t work so well. Also after I waxed my lower legs the hair came back within 4 weeks. I&#x27;m pretty sure the product stated regrowth wouldn&#x27;t return until 6 weeks. The reuseable strips are nice but I would just rather wax and throw away.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up any hair. The substance is weird, dry fast but not really sticky. Don&#x27;t waste your money :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used standard wax and then Moom, and the Moom is much better than just regular wax. I found the Moom to be less painful than wax and wash off easier. It&#x27;s easy to heat up and apply (if you have it at the right temperature). It also did a thorough job removing hair and didn&#x27;t leave very many strays.</li>
            <li> this stuff is lovely. i&#x27;m a long-time waxer, but i have always hated the mess of the conventional wax. now that i have tried this sugar wax, i&#x27;m not going back. instead of oil, water is all it takes to clean up.</li>
            <li> Gentle, great value, very effective.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin so I was nervous about waxing. This worked well and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Will definitly use again!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this item has such great reviews.  I trusted the reviews and tried the product.  Since it was my first time using an at home wax (or waxing at all), I thought my first failure may have been my fault.  So the following week I decided to try it again now that I had a bit more experience under my belt.  This wax did not pick up anything!  I tried it everywhere, bikini, legs, armpits.  My hairs are very soft and thin.  They are not thick, so I am not sure if this would work for someone with thick body hairs, but it definitely did not work for me.  After multiple attempts, my skin was left red, raw and irritated, and yes, still hairy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC. So easy to take off, and it came in the mail rather quickly! It&#x27;s less painful than waxing, and the stuff washes off so easily. I love that I can reuse the strips, too!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and it did not work at all. It was just sticky and was left on my skin. It took a long time to get it off and I had to scrub really hard. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin. You can hand me any kind of lotion for red bumps and mine will still be there. I also end up with the worst ingrown hairs known to man. Shaving has never been ideal for me, especially in the bikini area. I have tried depilatory creams that still leave my skin with red bumps. Depilatory creams are also filled with chemicals and I am all about the naturals for my body. When I searched for alternatives to waxing and shaving I came across Moom. I was skeptical, but it was worth a try. I have never had a wax nor have I ever waxed myself, so I knew this was going to be trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used Moom I tried the smaller strip on an area of my skin. I had to heat it up in the microwave just slightly so it was more spreadable, but let it go back to room temperature. I spread a paper-thin layer like the instructions said, rubbed the cloth strip rapidly over the wax, pulled my skin taught, and holy cow. Hair gone. It didn&#x27;t even sting as much as I anticipated. I do have a high pain tolerance, but all women know the bikini area is always incredibly sensitive. My skin was red for about 48 hours, but I applied coconut oil twice a day and exfoliated with a loofah and continue to do both every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other reviews say that doing large areas at a time give the best success, but I have to disagree and I disagree only because I am inexperienced. I ended up cutting up my cloth strips into smaller pieces and using them that way. Also, as I vaguely mentioned above, I do heat it up in the microwave so that it is more spreadable, but I do wait for it to go back to room temperature first. The thinner you spread this stuff the better results you will have. Less hair is removed if you have a ton of this stuff on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished I let the used cloth soak in water for about five minutes. The product came off no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want natural results that keep your skin clean and exfoliated at thesame time while waxing, then go all natural and go with Moom.</li>
            <li> Although it was very fast shipping..I hated this product. It didnt hurt like at all, but it was super messy, I ran out of strips on my legs because it just wouldnt pull the hair out, (I even used both sides of each strip). I eventually gave up and used my eyebrow plucker to make them even (Yes this took awhile).</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean up&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove fine hairs&lt;br /&gt;Takes me multiple tries to remove anything at all&lt;br /&gt;Hair grows back quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not that great. I know some people have mentioned that it just depends on how you apply it... but if it&#x27;s this difficult for SO many people to do it, then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product. The slight mess/pain I saved with Moom was just not worth it... going back to waxing kits!</li>
            <li> Bought this because my friend did and she had a lot of success with it.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, I&#x27;m not really ballsy enough to wax my legs, so I only did part of one of my legs...&lt;br /&gt;--BUT it&#x27;s been about two weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed that one part of my leg is really itchy and it hurts whenever I get goosebumps. Upon further inspection, I discovered that my pores in that section are clogged to the point where I can see the darkness and redness within every hair follicle.&lt;br /&gt;When I mentioned this to my friend, she told me that she had the exact same experience--only she did it all over her legs, her underarms, and her bikini line. So far, only her legs have shown this problem, but it&#x27;s still a major inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;I have even attempted to exfoliate that area on my legs, but hasn&#x27;t helped at all.&lt;br /&gt;As nice as it was to have a wax kit that was organic and water-soluble, I will not be buying this again, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it two stars because, well, it DID yank the hair out.</li>
            <li> Wish it was possible to give minus 5 stars. I was so excited for this product, but I tried it and didnt work, NOT A SINGLE HAIR WAS PULLED. The only thing that it pulled out was my skin. My skin is sensitive, and when I saw that this product only grabs the hairs, I was thrilled. Which was a LIE. Now I am left with a large red area on my upper lip. I wouldn&#x27;t recommended it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was so painful on my bikini area. I did one section exactly according to the instructions and couldn&#x27;t do the rest because it was much too painful. It was sticky and messy and caused me more pain than I had felt in a long time. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to use a product like this. It would take forever to do each strip if you did a larger area like your legs. Much faster to just shave, or get it done professionally. I would not recommend this or any type of waxing to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s completely water soluble, is easy to use and is entirely organic so it doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out!</li>
            <li> What a mess.  Probably me, but it just did not work.  Good for exfoliating maybe.  Going back to my waxer.</li>
            <li> A waste of money. I thought i&#x27;d try this instead of the GiGi product ive been using for years. I like the review the says it is easy to use and easy to remove. All false! I found out the hard way, and to make matters worst it did not even remove unwanted hair. Very frustrated</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money and then some! I have used dozens of home waxes over the last decade and this is the best. It works well, easy clean-up, and actually doesn&#x27;t hurt as badly as some other products I&#x27;ve used. I can now keep up with my brows and bikini line in the privacy of my own home. I will keep buying this product as long as they sell it! If you&#x27;re on the fence BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  1st time using I had to keep reapplying and trying. After some practice the next time I went to use it it worked perfectly.  It&#x27;s not hard to use once you get the technique down. Removes hair on face for atleast a couple weeks. I would never pay for another eyebrow or lip wax! The fact that it&#x27;s cruelity free and natural makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Gets rid  of the unwanted hairs painlessly.  I have learned how to pull just right and at an angle to get those more course hairs under control but it works great.</li>
            <li> I guess I had very high expectations, reading the prior customer&#x27;s reviews. I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be so hard to heat up, and once heated it was hard to manage putting it on the skin. My biggest dissapointment is that when a applied the strips, there was not enough of a bond between the strip and the wax and it didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs in the area. It was really dissapointing.</li>
            <li> This product was not as good a I thought it would be. I read so many great reviews and when I got it, it did not work at all. Yes, I followed all the instructions, but it did not work.</li>
            <li> Works really good! Not painful like normal wax!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it zero stars. Sure, it sounds like a great idea - organic, no waxes or petroleum, etc.  But after following the directions EXACTLY, I still could not get more than a couple of hairs removed. I finally just gave up and shaved.</li>
            <li> This product is by no stretch of the imagination painless. It&#x27;s very comparable to waxing. It&#x27;s simple and clean, just follow directions. You&#x27;ll probably get the goo on things but comes off anything very easily with warm water. The strips and applicators are reusable. Any review that says it is painless is a goddam lie. Everytime I have to pull a strip off I hesitate for a few seconds. You have to do it fast and parallel to the surface. First couple of times you&#x27;ll mess up but you&#x27;ll get it. The hair removal is extremely effective when done properly. The smell is very pleasant, but this will guarantee irritate your skin so ice it afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased Moom after reading reviews on a lot of waxing products. I had never waxed before and wanted to get the right product for me. I was simply tired of shaving constantly. I am a brunette and have thick dark hair that grows back visibly the day after shaving. The first time I used moom, I didn&#x27;t necessarily follow the step by step directions and hair removal was spotty at best. I really wanted this to work for me and so the next time I followed the directions completely and was amazed by the results! No more shaving for me! For other women with very thick hair on their legs... I did have to wax a couple times in the same area to remove all hair, and with practice I realized that the smaller amount of hair I go after at a time the better it is removed... and unfortunately you really do have to go without shaving for two weeks for this to work effectively. But it does work!!!</li>
            <li> I think I like this. It was so less painful than waxing (Brazilian) and a lot less messy because it cleans up neatly with water. No sticky wax to deal with. The only thing is that the hair grew back quickly but I think I read the more you do it, the less quickly regrowth will occur. I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Just an update. Had my 3rd Moom 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s true!  The area has not grown back as quickly as the first two times. I&#x27;ll take this any day over wax. I really like it- and especially the fact it washes away with water. And you do not need the wax heater. All around win!</li>
            <li> The best home removal system ever. Not painful at all. No bumping. And it&#x27;ll last for a while.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I am fairly new at all of this but it was really hard to get at the right temp and keep it warm so you can actually do a leg. Sometimes it worked sometimes it go barely any hair. And I did read the instructions word for word. Not worth the money and hassel. Loved the fact that it is natural just wish it actually worked. Disappointment.</li>
            <li> Just got Moom today in the mail and I totally love it! I was very skeptical about waxing because I have had bad experiences with it before so I thought I would give this sugar wax a try. I have to say I am very pleased with the results on my upper lip and now I am going to try my legs!! The price is great too, especially when you consider everything that comes with it. I would definitely recommend this product and I will be buying it again, but probably not anytime soon because it&#x27;s going to last forever!</li>
            <li> FINALLY! something that works! my skin is pretty sensitive too and I usually breakout after waxing..BUT.I didn&#x27;t this time and it removed my hair nicely! yay!</li>
            <li> First time user trying to save money at home turns into messy disaster with pain. I clearly need to let the professionals do the work and keep my daytime job.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! I was looking online for a while before deciding which one to get. Everyone has their own issues with waxing so I wanted something that works and is easy to use. I have never waxed before myself, only professionally done, so I was slightly nervous to try it out. However, it was so easy to work with. Warm up, apply, remove- done! It is super easy to remove with warm water if you spill the wax or decide that it is too painful, it wasn&#x27;t for me. I am very pleased with the product and will definitely be buying a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Moom starter kit, it had everything I needed and really made my first foray into the world of self-waxing easy!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I overzealously microwaved the wax too much and it burned my skin as the warning promised. So, please just microwave for 10 seconds at a time. 20 seconds is more than enough. More than.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great tip to heed is to make sure you are applying a very thin layer to your skin, the thinner the better! Gloopy and thick does not equal success here. (Although I would be hard-pressed to think of a situation where gloopy did? Heh.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase and really works. It&#x27;s easy to wash off with water since it&#x27;s sugar-based and super inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I really like the product ~! It removes hair efficiently and can be washed off with water, no more sticky wax~~!</li>
            <li> Did not seem to work for me</li>
            <li> This is a good product to buy. I had never waxed my legs before so to me it still hurt when the clothes were ripped off. I can&#x27;t compare it to traditional wax, but from what other reviewers say, it hurts less. I have pretty coarse hair and it did not take all the hair off in one pull, had to do it a couple times. Not sure if it was my technique or the wax itself but thought I would mention it. I love that the clothes are reusable and the sticks were included as well. Today is the week mark of using moom and legs are still smooth. Good product, and I love that is it organic. I would definitely recommend using it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a waxing product and I think I follow the directions exactly but was not at all pleased with the results. It did not remove most of the hair on my upper lip. I did read instructions and reviews that say it will not remove short hair but it didn&#x27;t even remove the longer hairs. I tried several times and just was not happy. It is also sticky and messy. I think the product may be fine for a salon or an experienced user. This is not for me! I contacted Amazon for a return and although this item is not eligible for return they promptly refunded me. Great customer service as always from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works great and easy (relatively) to use.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly, and just got so so results. No section came out completely smooth, and it took almost the entire jar to do the lower part of my legs. It gets three stars because it was easy to clean up and spread on, and after a week, it still feels like 12 hour growth. If i had dark hair, i might give it less stars.</li>
            <li> Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package IS NOT BAD  BUT IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE FACE</li>
            <li> defintily ordering again!</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product! from reading the reviews i thought it would actually work, but no. not only did it NOT remove my hair, even the finer ones, but it was a pain to get off. never again. waste of money.</li>
            <li> not working.... full of bs...</li>
            <li> Product does not work. You have to hair at least a quarter inch in length, according to their directions for it to properly work. Ladies are not going to let their chin hair grow to that length in order to use this product. It certainly does not work with hair less than 1/4 inch. It is similar to waxing anyway.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try on my bikini area as I have tried other products and was not happy, but not ready to go to a salon. Read the directions, and was skeptical because it seemed like there was a lot of room for error. I applied it and as I was removing the first strip, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t feel anything. Wrong! It painlessly removed the hair, I was shocked! If you can leave the normal waxing rules behind and just follow the directions, you will be very happy!</li>
            <li> I had never tried the waxing route before, but I was tired of plucking and the other reviews were good. I wanted to remove facial hair mostly under my chin. Fairly heavy black hair. I tried it numerous times, carefully following the instructions. If I ever got one hair off, that was a miracle. They said to have hair 1/4 inch so maybe that was the issue. If I wanted to wait until it was 1/4 inch long, I wouldn&#x27;t bother to remove it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did try it on my legs, and it worked fine there with longer hair, but honestly it is easier to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does come with plenty of reusable strips in various sizes and I think if you are lucky enough to have blond baby hair to get rid of, this would work fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> This product works great. Nothing like wax. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and comes off easy.would recommend to anyone. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> It really does what it promises to do, painless, fast, and the truth is the hair does come back less and less.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> So I very recently in my adult life learned how easy it is to wax at home. I totally believe this is partly due to my luck in finding this brand of wax. It smells sweet, heats up fast, goes on easy -- I wish I had discovered it earlier!</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows. works very very good. I need to reorder. I definitely would recommend it to someone else.</li>
            <li> ITS MY FIRST TIME WAXING AND I DECIDED TO TRY MOON AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS, I LOVE IT, EASY TO USE, BE CAREFUL IT GETS VERY HOT IF YOU LEAVE IT FOR TOO LONG IN THE MICROWAVE.. I USUALLY DO 20 SEC TO ME THAT PERFECT. IT CAN GET MESSY LOL BUT I DONT CARE, ITS WORTH IT, I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, my girlfriend and I are addicted to waxing each other. All the time. Forever!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The price is why it was given four stars. I now know how to make it at home, but in a pinch, this is my go to brand.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try this hair removal kit...It really works for me!! I have coarse facial hair on my neck and cheeks as a result of having PCOS that has caused me self-esteem issues since I&#x27;ve been a child. I&#x27;ve been getting my face waxed for years and it was so embarrassing to go into a salon and have people point out how much hair they had pulled off of my face!! I have tried things like electric razors, pre-waxed strips and hair removal creams and I was never super satisfied with the look afterwards. Well, let me tell you, this stuff is amazing. It gives me a freshly waxed smooth finish on my neck and chin and the few hairs that were left, I used a small electric razor to clip. Luckily, I have a high pain tolerance from years of waxing and getting piercings. I think this method can be difficult for those who have never gotten waxed before.    Here are a couple of tips!    -If you can handle a little bit of pain, use the wax cold instead of warm. Personally I feel like it&#x27;s a hassle to keep making sure it&#x27;s warm and it works just fine at room temperature.    -When using a stick to take out the wax, use wet fingers to cut the dripping goo! Since the stuff melts with water, I found that everything went a lot faster when I would dip the stick in, pull it out and then with wet fingers sort of pull the wax from the jar.    -Apply the wax directly to your skin. I found this method easier and I didn&#x27;t make a mess at all. No wax on my sink!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt when you wax. Love how it&#x27;s natural products. Just wished it would pick up more hair.</li>
            <li> Works as well as salon wax for my upper lip. Does not work for my legs even though followed all of the directions.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. The best thing is that its organic (and that is important) and the wax is soft on the skin when applied. I liked it and my next purchase will also be Moom Organic.</li>
            <li> Never having used such a product before I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and love  that it washes off with water. Regular wax has some serious horror stories that go along with it, and I didn&#x27;t want to risk one of the awkward situations I keep reading about. I have only, used this once, but I bet once I get good at it I can go from like to love!</li>
            <li> The product works as well as you can expect it to if you&#x27;re doing it at home for the first time you&#x27;re not going to get professional results but it worked for me and I am very happy. The only down side is that it does hurt I mean of course its going to you&#x27;re ripping your hair out but not as bad as it could be</li>
            <li> Works well on bikini area. However it does not work well on facial hair. I have tried it warmed and room temp. Neither  worked on face for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this about two or three months ago, and i just love it! I don&#x27;t shave at all anymore, I just use Moom. I love that it is super easy to clean up if I get it on anything (it&#x27;s like cleaning up syrup, just use water). If you don&#x27;t follow the directions, it won&#x27;t work as well. Only microwave it 5-10 sec. at a time, apply a very thin coat, use quickly so it doesn&#x27;t cool down too quick. It was super easy on the legs, armpits were very painful. I should have done smaller sections like they said.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with Moom. This is my first time using any sugar or waxing product, so I did have some missed hairs/broken hairs, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just user error and won&#x27;t be an issue with some practice. There were plenty of cloth strips included, and they were very easy to rinse clean. It hurt, but that is expected when you&#x27;re pulling out hair. Afterwards, my skin was left very soft. The jar is small, but if you&#x27;re using a thin layer as directed, I think it will last a long time. I am looking forward to throwing away my razor.</li>
            <li> First time waxer, I bought this for use on my lower legs and underarms before a vacation. I grew the hair out for 2 weeks prior to using and the hair was a little more than 1/8 inch long. I did not use any baby powder or anything like that with it and followed the directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, very easy to clean up, re-usable strips, was not too painful (much less painful than home laser which i also tried for a short time), did not leave any kind of rash or reaction on my skin (a little redness in the pores faded in a couple of hours). picked up almost all the hair that was 1/8 inch or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Left about 5% of the hairs- mostly just ones that were too short or fine. I will need to follow up the moom with either plucking/epilating or shaving these leftover hairs or try moom again in a few more days. It cools off pretty quickly and needs to be reheated several times when doing a big area like legs- I am going to put it in a bowl of hot water next time to try keeping it warm longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: If doing a large area like legs, you will need at least 2 jars I would recommend getting 3. After applying the strip, I would wait about 10 seconds before removing it to give the sugar time to cool off a little. I think this helped make sure that most of the hairs came off. It&#x27;s difficult to see to do the backs of legs - you can do it but it would be really great if you had someone else to do those parts for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found out how long the results will last yet. If they actually last at least 3-4 weeks then I would definitely consider repurchasing for future occasions.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought some years ago because I was sick and tired of spending an hour in the bathroom plucking my eyebrows one by one. Too time consuming and it was always painful. Wax... well, after seeing my mother use it on herself (and I still can&#x27;t get the smell of microwaved wax out of my memory, ewww!) and how she struggled with it, I never wanted to even try that stuff. So I&#x27;m so glad I found Moom. It works very much the same way as wax, but smells much better and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was afraid it would. Not going to lie, it is going to hurt a bit. You are ripping little hairs from your body, it&#x27;s just inevitable there will be pain of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moom is nice in that you don&#x27;t HAVE to heat it up, but there have been times during colder months that I find it&#x27;s more solid than usual. In that event, I do pop it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds and then wait for it cool down a bit before I use it on my skin. The muslin strips are also a nice touch. There are two sizes of strips- small and HUGE and I rarely ever need to use the latter. It includes two sizes of \\&quot;applicators\\&quot; as well which are really nothing more than wooden popsicle sticks or tongue depressors, again one set thin and the other wide (I use the thin one). The sticks and fabrics bits are easy to clean, just use soap and water and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moom is easy to apply, almost too easy. I&#x27;d caution anyone who uses it that LESS IS MORE! You can always remove more hair, you can&#x27;t replace it once it&#x27;s gone nearly as easily so take your time and apply with care. Oh yeah, remember to wash your face BEFORE you use it. You really do need to remove any natural oils otherwise it won&#x27;t work nearly as well (I&#x27;ve forgotten a few times with frustrating results). And always have some moisturizer on hand afterwards to apply to the spots where hair was removed, it will be tender and might get dried out. Moisturizer will help that. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this wax after reading the reviews on amazon and I am so happy I bought it. It is very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t hurt so much as the other ones, including the wax that I used to get done in the parlor. And the results last longer too. I also tried this on my face and it didn&#x27;t give me rashes like the others and didn&#x27;t pain much. It also leaves the skin very smooth. I recommend this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, and while it was undeniably easier to clean up, when I pulled off the strip I found a strip full of moom, and all the hair still on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this multiple times with thinner applications of Moom, and different/smaller areas of skin. No luck. This went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> the product didn&#x27;t work waste of my money. wish i had saved the money instead of spending it on this.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time trying any type of at home wax, so maybe that is my problem, but this stuff didn&#x27;t work as great as I was hoping. I followed the directions to a T, and I applied it to my legs, I got 1/2 way done with 1 leg and gave up. It didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair in one try, so  I had to re-do 1 spot a few times. It does how ever clean up very easy, so that is a plus! I will just keep it and use it for smaller areas like my eyebrows, and underarms..</li>
            <li> I could not wait for this product to arrive. I was so excited to do this. I worked at a salon for a yr and could never muster up the courage to let somebody wax my legs. Now with my wedding a month away I was super excited to try it. Money is getting tight so I couldn&#x27;t spend $100 at the salon just for my legs. I waxed half my leg and it felt like 2 day old stubble. It didn&#x27;t rip any of my hairs out from the root. It&#x27;s just not what I expected. I gave 2 stars for the nice strips and super easy clean up. I wish there was some sort of oil or lotion for afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Mom</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this would be something good to use for those gross, stray chin hairs you sometimes get. Well, I read ALL the instructions like it said, I even considered the suggestions posted on the reviews! Still, after 4 times of trying this product it did NOTHING for me. I have very thin, fine, blonde hair and it still did not remove what I wanted it to remove. And then I found out I couldn&#x27;t return it. I guess I&#x27;ll try and sell it at a garage sale ....not worth it...</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as wax but much less pain and easier to clean after. It might require several applications for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff almost pain free so much better then wax</li>
            <li> I have had this for about six months and was afraid to use.  But I am tired of paying $20.00 for a lip wax.  So - I got brave.  I followed the directions and just heated slightly, applied the cloth and then gently pulled.  It came off and there was no pain.  So I thought it did not work.  I looked at cloth and there were a few small hairs on it and I looked in the mirror and there were no hairs next to my lip.  I was so amazed.  It worked and it was pain free.  I love this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and have very thin fine hair, I used this to get the thinker hairs but I always had to go back over it with another kind of wax. The cotton strips mold after a while. I bought the 6 oz bottle then the 12 oz. Half way through the 12oz bottle my strips were moldy. I washed them exactly how the instructions say to but they still molded. When I called customer service they were very rude and unhelpful. I recommend using another brand. This company does not stand behind their prodect.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger pack. More quantity.The wax  adheres well to the hair and removes it very effectively</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product after seeing how much the reviews varied on it, but I figured I would give it a try. It works a lot better than the Nads wax strips I had used before (it actually removes the hair). Definitely use the corn starch on the skin before &amp;#34;mooming.&amp;#34; It is kind of annoying to have to reheat the product several times during use, but other than that it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> nothing particularly special</li>
            <li> I felt sorry for my daughter who was getting sores from using soft wax (Honey Wax) to remove the fuzz from her upper lips, so I did some research and ordered Moom organic Tea Tree and Lavender hair removal kits. The product did not completely remove the hair in one and even two applications which was frustrating. We tried it about a dozen times to make sure is wasn&#x27;t due to user error. We tried different techniques as shown on the Moom video but the problem was not with the application technique but with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the clean up was easier and the product wasn&#x27;t harsh like soft wax, it failed at removing hair on high school girls and the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more searching, I ordered hard wax without strips ([...] The stuff works. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean up. Just microwave for 3 minutes, mix and apply warm with a stick, let solidify (1-2minutes) and peel off. The clean up is easy because once the wax hardens it&#x27;s not sticky and easily peels off any surface. It is more expensive but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Easy to heat but it misses A LOT of hairs!!! Like that the straps are re usable but I  personaly wouldnt recommend it for underarms...</li>
