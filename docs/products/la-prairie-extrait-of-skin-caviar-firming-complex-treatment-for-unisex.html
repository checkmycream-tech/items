            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...........noticebly fewer wrinkles and glowing skin in less than two weeks........it leaves a silky layer on your skin and you really just glow........it may be pricy but this product delivers!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using La Prairie for almost 30 years and I&#x27;m constantly told what skin I have, so now I&#x27;m afraid to ever stop using it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and find it does a great job of moisturinzing and keeping skin firm.  Recommend it for mid and mature!</li>
            <li> Firming Complex by La Prairie is a soft cream, with pleasant smell which is almost imperceptible and making the skin fall back to the place of youth. It absorbs immediately and the skin looks beautiful. Price is worth every drop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuela Hidalgo Rose-Price from CHILE</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the end of 2011 on amazon, and recently I have seen it in a shopping mall. It is totally different. The one I bought on amazon has a cheap-looking package and cheap smelling. , I cannt believe it is a luxurious skin care. However, the one in shopping mall looks worthy.  I am so mad about it since I have finished using it and I&#x27;m not able to return it. I have bought many skin cares on amazon, I hope they are not fake. My friend bought a fake Kiehl&#x27;s skin care on Amazon, too. I will never buy skin care products on amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I think this product is overpriced and overrated.  I used it for about a week or so and within 2 hours of application my face was shiny, super greasy-looking.  Gross. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> so good ,my wife love it……&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;ok~</li>
            <li> There are 3 products I consider REQUIREMENTS for good, healthy skin in the long run.  THIS is basic to that collection in the LaPrairie line.  Start every day with it... and I&#x27;ve never been sorry.</li>
