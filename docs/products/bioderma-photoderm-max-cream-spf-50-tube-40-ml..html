    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a fan of  all the sunscreens in the Bioderma line.</li>
            <li> woow ship. came in 2 weeks i was waiting late thank you so much guys i love this creme i have really sensitive skin and its only this creme protect my face perfectly... Also you guys sented to me gifts H2o and lipstick that i always using for my lips . 100 starts job guys !!!!</li>
            <li> Tried this on a friends recommendation. Very light. Doesn&#x27;t breakout my face as most sunscreens do. Does not turn greasy. Sometimes I mix it with my foundation works like a charm. Haven&#x27;t tried the tinted  Will purchase again tho it is on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily over my face nutritive cream and it is excellent. It protects and is smooth. Love it</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this line.  It&#x27;s very popular in Asia.  They even have an spf 100 which is hard to find.  PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THE LABELS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY ON AMAZON.  There are a few fake bioderma products out there on amazon.  This stuff is the real deal.  It&#x27;s a great sunscreen.  Not oily or greasy.  You can wear alone or under make up.  Highly rec.</li>
            <li> Probably the best SPF I&#x27;ve used. First bought in Europe but decided it&#x27;s worth it to pay the extra to keep buying it in the US.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothes or car and the milky feeling is so great! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen is the only kind that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen.  Goes on easily, absorbed quickly, and does not negatively affect your skin.  You will not burn.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy, even on days where I don&#x27;t use makeup and put translucent powder over it to try to soak up some of the shine. I tried this for a week and the greasiness was just too much.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly with almost no white cast and doesn&#x27;t look too shiny. However, this product irritated my skin so I don&#x27;t use it any longer.</li>
            <li> is too tiny, i thought  (for the price) that it was more big I dont like it at all, in my country sells others brands cheaper and bigger</li>
            <li> I found this product in Europe a few years ago.  Happy to purchase in the States and a very good price at Amazon. I have very sensitive skin and allergic to many products.  This one works! My face doesn&#x27;t break out and the SPF factor is very effective.  I use for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Bought this product through Omorfia shop. Half the order was delayed, but the company straightened it out and comped me. Very nice.  Bioderma Cream is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. No shine, no film, like both the cream for winter and tint for summer. works well over moisterizers and under make up. Great Sun Protection!</li>
            <li> Not my favourite a bit heavy leaves a white sheen</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday. The shipment is prompt and the product is what it claims to be. I love the smooth texture that this product brings to skin. It is not like the Neutrogena Helipolex that will leave streaks on my face (my co-worker kept telling me I had white stuff on my face).  This lotion is much thinner and easier to apply. It gives a natural glow to my face and I don&#x27;t look like I am wearing a white mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done a lot of research on the best facial cream that contains SPF.  The Bioderma&#x27;s Photoderm Max has the ingredients that provide substantial broad spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product since UVA rays can cause cellular damage under the dermis. This damage can lead to wrinkles, skin sagging, age spots and some types of skin cancers.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this product does not have Methylparaben, propylparaben, oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate which are carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that people can get this much cheaper in France so if you travel to France all the time, maybe you can give this a try.</li>
            <li> Probably the most cosmetically elegant high PPD western sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. It dries clear (ni white cast) but it can leave white streaks if you&#x27;re not very careful, especially near the edges of the face (hairline, bottom of chin, etc.) Like most sunscreens, it is shiny (albeit not thick and greasy), but this can be fixed with a powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Since it is different from the one I have used earlier,at present I couldn&#x27;t say now the effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens before finding this one through Makeupalley.com&#x27;s skin care board. Am I ever glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent sunscreen for sensitive skin, dry skin, or any skin. I have rosacea and many face products hurt my facial skin. This one doesn&#x27;t, dries down to a clear finish, and acts as a foundation base when I need it. Because my skin is so parched, I do pat moisturizer on my cheeks before applying it. This is my second purchase and as long as it&#x27;s available, I&#x27;ll be buying this and only this.</li>
            <li> They have a lot of patience to talk to customer.</li>
            <li> I was excited cause I hear the stuff is good.  Just be forewarned 40ml isn&#x27;t very much.  For 25 bucks you might get 3 applications tops.  It is about the size of a shampoo bottle you might get at the dollar bin.</li>
            <li> I like how smoothly this product goes on and that it&#x27;s completely fragrance free. However,I won&#x27;t know how well it works until I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for an hour at a time.  The one bad thing about it is that the tube was only half full making it terribly expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if that was a fluke. I would buy it again and hope that the next tube will be full when it arrives.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amaizing! I have been using it daily and even under makeup. I have sensitive skin but this product is perfect and my skin doesn&#x27;t brake out from it. I have pigmentation from the sun only in the summer time, hopefully this sunscreen will help to protect my skin so the spots will not darken. So far excellent! Also this product is authentic and comes from France.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunscreen for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer under it since it is so hydrating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I  purchased this item in Costa Rica and was very impressed with the protection it provided from the sun, so I was very glad to see it available at Amazon .com.  It is a smooth creme that becomes invisible once applied.  It is also available in a tinted form which I found too dark for my fair complexion.  I mixed the two and obtained a lighter color that gives a slightly tanned appearance  so I didn&#x27;t feel super white when I first hit the beach. It also seems to go a long way. A tube of plain creme and a tube of tinted creme lasted the whole summer and beyond when I applied it to my face, neck and upper chest every day. I don&#x27;t need SPF 50 on my arms and legs. (I noticed in Costa Rica it is labelled SPF 100!)</li>
            <li> It works!!!!!! My face had some dark spots not very dark but I was able to see it around my lips and at the corner of my nose. I wanted to bleach my face but at the same time I thought about what if it goes wrong so I asked a doctor to see what he recommemded and he told me about this product so I bought it. I use it EVERYDAY and I have been using this product for about 4 months and I can see the difference.  I don&#x27;t have dark spots and round my lips or my nose. My skin is more even which I love it. By the way I have been using the same bottle since the beginning but I think I will need a new bottle by the end of this month.</li>
            <li> This works really well and does not break me out or have an annoying fragrance. I have used so many different brands, but this one is by far the best!</li>
