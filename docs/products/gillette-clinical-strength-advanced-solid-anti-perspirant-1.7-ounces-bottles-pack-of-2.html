            <li>Great price on Amazon with their Subscribe &amp; Save program</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li>Love it and you will too!!</li>
            <li>Stuff smells great like cologne and when you sweat the good smell spreads.</li>
            <li>It works, it smells good, it keeps me smelling good and not sweaty.</li>
            <li>It works, even on the hottest days; it smells good; and it goes on</li>
            <li>Smell is good -- not overpowering and not girly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to wear cheap undershirts to avoid ruining your nice shirts.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to be able to order it</li>
            <li>Sure you smell great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with it than anything else.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Whether it was related to this or not, I am unsure.&lt;br /&gt;Product is awesome.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I have no brand loyalty.</li>
            <li>I now sweat \\&quot;normally\\&quot;, and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Probably better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>has a nice scent - not too minty, not medicine like, just a nice fresh clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling fresh with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Even putting on a clean shirt after just applying the product does not leave deoderant tracks on clothing.</li>
            <li>Eventually I got a prescription anti-perspirant and it worked great -- but it often left me itchy and it didn&#x27;t exactly have a deodorant effect with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you about why I am uniquely qualified to review this product.</li>
            <li>I always smell fresh and never have to worry about wetness or BO smell.  </li>
            <li>then they say is out of stock, I used the subscription service to save money and have it when i needed it, only to get one shipment and then find out on my own that they say it is backordered.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This may cost a bit more but it is certainly worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of like a thick paste (can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it).</li>
            <li>Price has been very decent compared to drug stores.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about this.</li>
            <li>He really likes the constancy and dies fairly fast.</li>
            <li>no sweat at all for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>stuff appears to make me reduce about 75% less than I normally would while working out (on the areas its applied), which to me is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Probably due to the aluminum zirconium trichlorohyrdrex - most products with that work well.  </li>
            <li>In college, I usually wore a nice button up/down shirt -- but ALWAYS with an undershirt too, so that I had something to absorb my sweat so that it didn&#x27;t show on my outer shirt.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth like powder, prevents odor, keeps you dry, and does not stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s enough to keep me fresh and</li>
            <li>The heat rash is on my side because of sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In 1994, as a High School senior, I set a world record in the open division of Sweat Volume, 1-hour class (322.6</li>
            <li>Starting at the end of high school, I started to realize I sweat a lot from my pits.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but normally about midway through my workout</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a typical dry deodorant bar.</li>

            <li> No more wet pits when just sitting around!</li>
            <li> it from an active guy who had excessive pit sweating for about 10 years now.</li>
            <li> like the roll type action - small dial at the bottom to push the deodorant up.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 3-time Olympic Gold medalist in the Armpit Sweating event (with my late teammate Franz \\&quot;The Hungarian Horse\\&quot; Kozslo).</li>
            <li> They leave my pits begging for mercy, confused and packing home to momma.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. The sweatiest of the sweaty and the stinkiest of the stinky will be really happy with this product. I&#x27;ve had better luck with it than anything else.</li>
            <li> If you need extra strength this is the product for you.  Best price on line.  Saved over $4.00</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I always smell fresh and never have to worry about wetness or BO smell.  It works really well and this is all I use from now on.  Best product I have used. Price has been very decent compared to drug stores.</li>
            <li> I am a return customer to this product! Love it and you will too!! Great Value for the price!! Best Deal Out There!! BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> Great item, but the company I bought it from ( Amazon.com ) has turned into a joke.  The sell the item then they say is out of stock, I used the subscription service to save money and have it when i needed it, only to get one shipment and then find out on my own that they say it is backordered. They never bothered to even call or e-mail me that is was out of stock, I had to check the site myself.  Every store in the country has the item and it says on the Amazon site that they have it in stock.  Yet the do not ship it, and keep giving bogus or no responses at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I was so happy to be able to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent - not too minty, not medicine like, just a nice fresh clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I like the roll type action - small dial at the bottom to push the deodorant up.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ive ever used. Lasts a really long time. And I sweat alot. Finally found what works. I wont buy another deodorant.</li>
            <li> This may cost a bit more but it is certainly worth the extra expense.  It is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about this. It works, it smells good, it keeps me smelling good and not sweaty. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells great like cologne and when you sweat the good smell spreads. Sure you smell great but I bought this to stop me from sweating it doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only helps prevent the sweat, but also makes me smell awesome.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff appears to make me reduce about 75% less than I normally would while working out (on the areas its applied), which to me is just amazing. Not only that, but normally about midway through my workout I&#x27;d start noticing the stench of my sweat. Not when wearing this stuff tho! Only downside is I got heat rash after a week of use. Whether it was related to this or not, I am unsure.&lt;br /&gt;Product is awesome. The heat rash is on my side because of sensitive skin. (since it blocks the sweat glands, the surrounding area has to deal with the extra heat trying to be released)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend swears by this for his every day deodorant. He does not use it overnight as a replacement for his every day deodorant as the directions say because it gets on the sheets. I have noticed that that overtime this deodorant stains his clothing. It&#x27;s best to wear cheap undershirts to avoid ruining your nice shirts. It&#x27;s not a gel and it&#x27;s not a typical dry deodorant bar. Its kind of like a thick paste (can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it). He really likes the constancy and dies fairly fast. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Folks, this is the best deodorant I have ever tried in my life. I live in Europe where it is not available *Dont know why* so every time some friends go to the US I ask them to bring some. Don-t buy similar products such as the CVS branded one because there is no comparison at all.&lt;br /&gt;I use one third of the recommended quantity *1 click instead of 3 clicks* once per day and that&#x27;s enough to keep me fresh and no sweat at all for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Just try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you about why I am uniquely qualified to review this product. I am a 3-time Olympic Gold medalist in the Armpit Sweating event (with my late teammate Franz \\&quot;The Hungarian Horse\\&quot; Kozslo). I have competed in sweating events in 5 continents. In 1994, as a High School senior, I set a world record in the open division of Sweat Volume, 1-hour class (322.6 cc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits, nicknamed \\&quot;Thunder\\&quot; and \\&quot;Storm\\&quot;, respectively, have reduced lesser anti-perspirants to rubble. They can burn holes through 3 layers of clothes, flame-retardant or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until they met the glorious power of Gillette Clinical Strength. They leave my pits begging for mercy, confused and packing home to momma. Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, recommend! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Best deoderant anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on smooth like powder, prevents odor, keeps you dry, and does not stain your clothes.  Even putting on a clean shirt after just applying the product does not leave deoderant tracks on clothing.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I have no brand loyalty. I&#x27;ll use Creat, Colgate, Aquafresh, or any other brand of toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve learned over the past couple of years to rely on Gillette Clinical Strength. It works, even on the hottest days; it smells good; and it goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  The product&#x27;s white paste can leave a trace on t-shirts if you dressed immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Starting at the end of high school, I started to realize I sweat a lot from my pits. In college, I usually wore a nice button up/down shirt -- but ALWAYS with an undershirt too, so that I had something to absorb my sweat so that it didn&#x27;t show on my outer shirt. Eventually I got a prescription anti-perspirant and it worked great -- but it often left me itchy and it didn&#x27;t exactly have a deodorant effect with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways...when \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot; deodorants came into the market, that&#x27;s when I grabbed the Gillette Clinical Strength stuff. Haven&#x27;t looked back since. No need for the prescription anymore, as this does the job to a satisfactory amount. I use it morning and sometimes night. I now sweat \\&quot;normally\\&quot;, and am quite pleased. I prefer the Sport version (though it&#x27;s only the scent that differs from the other ones available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from an active guy who had excessive pit sweating for about 10 years now. This stuff keeps it under control. No more wet pits when just sitting around! And it doesn&#x27;t leave you itchy. It leaves you feeling fresh with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deoderant for over 3 years no, and I haven&#x27;t needed to switch.  I sweat a lot and I&#x27;m a big guy.  This stuff works. Probably better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this and said it does work.  Not sure why Arctic Clean scent is cheaper than the other one though.  Great price on Amazon with their Subscribe &amp; Save program and I looked everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of dissatisfaction over the years with deodorants and anti-antiperspirants. This is one is perfect!.&lt;br /&gt;Works great. Expensive but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Probably due to the aluminum zirconium trichlorohyrdrex - most products with that work well.  Smell is good -- not overpowering and not girly.  Seems like I dont need to worry even when putting on a black t shirt.</li>
