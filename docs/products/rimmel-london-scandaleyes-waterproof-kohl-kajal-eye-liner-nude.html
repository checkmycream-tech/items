            <li>They are good but the price could be lower.</li>

            <li>Perfect for lining the inner part of your lower eyelid.</li>
            <li>This looks more like concealer than an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive eyes, which I&#x27;m very happy about.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect nude for my inner rim.glides on smoothly and stays put all day.grt buy.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy!</li>
            <li>but it breaks so easily because it is so creamy</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s also easy to remove when you need to.</li>
            <li>i really think you should try it!!!</li>
            <li>great price- stays on long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still buy it again because of how smooth and pigmented it is right away on the waterline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine really!  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, and makes my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li>This works okay, but not as well as my similar Anastasia liner.</li>
            <li>and it looks way better than white liner if you&#x27;ve ever tried that.</li>
            <li>Love the color and pigmntation - use it to wake my eyes up a bit more than usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using white eyeliner to line the inside of your lower eyelid.</li>
            <li>it is soooo much better than the white pencils..</li>
            <li>Really brightens eyes!</li>
            <li>I have bought more expensive nude pencils and this one is equally good.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Really works as goog cover stick around eyes.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s more subtle than the white eyeliner ..</li>
            <li>more natural than the traditional white..</li>
            <li>It was soft and did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I prefer to line the lower waterline in cream, rather than white, as it brightens up the eye without looking too mod.</li>
            <li>Gives your eyes a fresh, wide awake look.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I got very excited!&lt;br</li>

            <li> Works really well.  The nude color looks so much better then the white.  Gives your eyes a fresh, wide awake look.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I got very excited!&lt;br /&gt;It is just what they say.. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;This made my eyes pop with out looking like I was going goth.&lt;br /&gt;Much more natural than the traditional white..&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I love this. It was soft and did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Really works as goog cover stick around eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine really!  I just don&#x27;t like putting product on my waterline.  It irritates my eyes and gets on my contact lenses.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s more subtle than the white eyeliner .. glad I bought it</li>
            <li> A bit darker for my skintone but still very nice colour.</li>
            <li> They are good but the price could be lower.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so creamy and smooth but it breaks so easily because it is so creamy so when you sharpen it the product just breaks off</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude for my inner rim.glides on smoothly and stays put all day.grt buy.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but not as well as my similar Anastasia liner. It&#x27;s a good color and goes on fairly easily, it just doesn&#x27;t stick to the waterline as well as I would like</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive nude pencils and this one is equally good. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and it looks way better than white liner if you&#x27;ve ever tried that. I took away a star for longevity. I&#x27;d still buy it again because of how smooth and pigmented it is right away on the waterline.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive eyes. Looks great and lightens your eyes; however, both times I used it on my waterline I quickly developed a nasty allergy that lasted for more than two days. I am now only using it to define my eyebrows, hence the three-star review.</li>
            <li> Difficult to sharpen! Otherwise ok!</li>
            <li> This causes the eye to water and redden. Not sure if its because the product is not a good one or if it is because the product sent is a bad one.</li>
            <li> This can be nice if you learn to work with it</li>
            <li> Love the color and pigmntation - use it to wake my eyes up a bit more than usual. Needs re-application to get through the day but still does it&#x27;s job well! Overall a good buy!</li>
            <li> I love the color of this kajal. Using pearly color on the rim is good for a night time look, but this beige is very nice during the day to make the eyes look more awake. I wish it was easier to apply it - it goes on a tiny bit thick.</li>
            <li> I prefer to line the lower waterline in cream, rather than white, as it brightens up the eye without looking too mod. This is the perfect color but it&#x27;s a bit on the thicker side. It almost reminds me of a concealer stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive eyes, which I&#x27;m very happy about.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner every day. Perfect for lining the inner part of your lower eyelid. It stays on all day! But it&#x27;s also easy to remove when you need to. It&#x27;s better than using white eyeliner to line the inside of your lower eyelid.</li>
            <li> loved the color the texture and this liner is perfect</li>
            <li> OMG this really makes ur eyes so much more awake!!!!!!!!! i&#x60;ve been looking for something like this for soo long.. it is soooo much better than the white pencils.. i really think you should try it!!!</li>
            <li> Used in waterline to make eyes pop. Works well.</li>
            <li> I am a make up artist. This is a great eye brightener- great product- great price- stays on long. Usual Amazon service.</li>
            <li> This looks more like concealer than an eyeliner. It does have a creamy consistency but the color looks awful on me.</li>
            <li> Very nice neutral color.  Goes on nicely, and makes my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> Not quite long lasting. It gets blotchy after few hours and collects on the lash roots. Not a big fan</li>
            <li> Really brightens eyes!</li>
