            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>This is light hold hairspray and it smells divine!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Used Shaper Plus but wanted to try something different - this has been an excellent option.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t decide, but I think I do like this one better...</li>
            <li>so that I wonder if it will really work, LOL</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray ever.  </li>
            <li>I love Chi products, however this one is</li>
            <li>Love love love....</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>If you want great hold with soft hair and movement TRY THIS!!</li>
            <li>I was spoiled by the original Ojon hair spray and they discontinued it, so this was an awesome replacement after trying several brands.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too, its light</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel crunchy, and still easily moveable.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells really good, not at all like normal hairspray.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but just enough to make you smell good:)</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Chi Infratexture flexible hair spray</li>
            <li>This hairspray is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does cost more but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is also well priced and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>chi is such a great product.</li>
            <li>It has a really light hold, which is all I need.  </li>
            <li>I DO NOT LIKE CHEAP SPRAY HOLD AND SMELL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but I love the way it holds.</li>
            <li>So, yes it&#x27;s a wonderful product that provides just enough hold but not so much you have a helmet head where your hair moves as one unit every time the wind blows.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it \\&quot;natural hold\\&quot;, more like strong hold, but since my hair is very fine</li>
            <li>It goes on even, smells fantastic, drys really quick, and holds your hair the way you want it till you either wash it or comb it out.</li>
            <li>It was completely worth the price for the huge bottle.</li>
            <li>The only thing about this product is that it leaves my hair shiny...but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, not too strong, has a clean smell to it, and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, will be gone in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s super hot, so it works!</li>
            <li>Very glad I did, provides more hold than the Infratexture but doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and feels great</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.  </li>
            <li>Has a very nice scent but not to heavy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and has a good clean scent.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy and a LOT of hair and this stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>It also allows for manipulating the hair right after spraying (moving the hair, scrunching, accenting the edges).  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold without overdoing it and adds shine.  </li>
            <li>I have really super straight hair that my curls fall after about 2-3 hours of styling them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people who also love the product, as well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to hold my short, curly hairstyle, but light enough to be able to run your fingers through your hair (depending on how much you use).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large can.</li>
            <li>The hairspray is light and still manages to hold my limp hair through humidity, would recommend it to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Try it, I know you will like it as much as me.  </li>
            <li>Really does as it says.</li>
            <li>The scent is so strong and lasts for a long time</li>
            <li>And it doesnt ruin the body by weighing it down like most sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>very llight and natural - almost too much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the goodness in this sleek and sexy red bottle!  </li>
            <li>right though at night ready for next day styling.</li>
            <li>even though I don&#x27;t like paying the price - tight wad here - I can&#x27;t find any brand that I like better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>a little more stronger hold</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, holds perfectly (not too hard, but doesn&#x27;t allow your hair to fly away either).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink like normal hairspray and she likes the way it holds.</li>
            <li>i live in a humid climate and my hair is frizzy</li>
            <li>but I have allergies and am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive scalp problem &amp; had to stop haircolor &amp; hair products....</li>
            <li>Easily combs out to reset if you need to, not necessary to wash your hair for up to 3 days, even 4 if you need to go that long.  </li>
            <li>It is great for holding the style, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t wear your hair down to where it looks greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li>I purchased natural hold</li>
            <li>However, i wanted natural hold.</li>
            <li>I recommend this hairspray if you want natural hold.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Bumble &amp; Bumble Classic Hairspray, but at almost double the price of CHI</li>
            <li>The can is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The spray is not too sticky and does not make your hair super stiff, but it still holds it in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy!!</li>
            <li>Hard to find this exact can in the stores, but worth every penny spent for shipping online.</li>
            <li>, it holds my style very well, but it isn&#x27;t as flexible as some other sprays.</li>
            <li>Gave my heavy hair a little root lift with its hold like many others</li>

            <li> i live in a humid climate and my hair is frizzy</li>
            <li> but I have allergies and am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive scalp problem &amp; had to stop haircolor &amp; hair products....</li>
            <li> Easily combs out to reset if you need to, not necessary to wash your hair for up to 3 days, even 4 if you need to go that long.  </li>
            <li> It is great for holding the style, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t wear your hair down to where it looks greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I purchased natural hold</li>
            <li> However, i wanted natural hold.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hairspray if you want natural hold.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Bumble &amp; Bumble Classic Hairspray, but at almost double the price of CHI</li>
            <li> The can is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The spray is not too sticky and does not make your hair super stiff, but it still holds it in place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find this exact can in the stores, but worth every penny spent for shipping online.</li>
            <li> , it holds my style very well, but it isn&#x27;t as flexible as some other sprays.</li>
            <li> Gave my heavy hair a little root lift with its hold like many others</li>
            <li> Really big bottle for long lasting spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to scents, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i use lots of hairspray after blowing it dry.  </li>
            <li> Can be used for several days without washing hair without weighing it down, causing flaking or anything else undesirable.  </li>
            <li> Just get it mostly dry or semi wet and spray a little, and it will maintain a firm hold all day long.</li>
            <li> so I can now wash my hair every other day instead of every day</li>
            <li> I have been looking so hard for a hair spray that will actually hold my curls.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this is the only spray thar can hold it without making my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> I do not how it holds other people&#x27;s, i think my hair is too stiff idk</li>
            <li> Will hold my curls for hours without making them stiff or weighing them down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look greasy and almost a little wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> but when it came it was firm hold.</li>
            <li> It holds my style ALL day without drying or feeling heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It holds my hair without that stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> Holds well without looking stiff.  </li>
            <li> It holds the hair without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave the hair stiff</li>
            <li> I like a spray that holds but doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray is a little pricier that I usually use and the smell is a bit overpowering for me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well for a slick look</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for anything messy or complex, this is the hairspray you want.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that they sent the firm hold in the place or natural.</li>
            <li> I have been unhappy about Amazon for a while, particularly Amazon Prime but thought I&#x27;d give it another shot, even after a separate disappointing experience with another product.&lt;br /&gt;The cap of the hairspray was broken, in 3 pieces, the can is scratched up in several areas and now won&#x27;t spray at all.</li>
            <li> it does not make my hair 2 hard &amp; it holds all day........</li>
            <li> I just received my product and will be disappointed in Amazon for the last time.</li>
            <li> It has been very hard to manage my hair without hairspray ...</li>
            <li> but alas, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sort of awkward for storage.</li>
            <li> This hairspray wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order this.</li>
            <li> I have always hated hair spray...until this stuff!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hairspray because you can add texture and layers to your style and it holds all day.  Easily combs out to reset if you need to, not necessary to wash your hair for up to 3 days, even 4 if you need to go that long.  Does not build up or get sticky at all.  Try it, I know you will like it as much as me.  I was spoiled by the original Ojon hair spray and they discontinued it, so this was an awesome replacement after trying several brands.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is fantastic. It does cost more but is well worth it. It&#x27;s a large can. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel tacky but silky. The smell is out of this world! It also gives great shine.</li>
            <li> was dented upon arrival</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It has a very light hold, which is all I want. It also has a nice smell. This was the best price around for this product.</li>
            <li> Really does as it says. Will hold my curls for hours without making them stiff or weighing them down. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always hated hair spray...until this stuff! It goes on even, smells fantastic, drys really quick, and holds your hair the way you want it till you either wash it or comb it out. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. And it is cheaper on amazon than at my salon...bonus!:)</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair flexible, brushable even, after application.  Can be used for several days without washing hair without weighing it down, causing flaking or anything else undesirable.  I am a huge fan of the Chi Infratexture flexible hair spray so I thought I would try this one.  Very glad I did, provides more hold than the Infratexture but doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff.</li>
            <li> The hairspray holds you hair quite well.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it \\&quot;natural hold\\&quot;, more like strong hold, but since my hair is very fine it needs that extra hold power. Great smelling too.</li>
            <li> The hold this hairspray provides is good. However, it smells like men&#x27;s cologne to me and every time I put it on I feel like I smell like a dude. Just for your information! :)</li>
            <li> I love Chi Hairspray and amazon has the best prices for it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and has a good clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I purchased natural hold but when it came it was firm hold. I have used both and like both. However, i wanted natural hold. I was disappointed that they sent the firm hold in the place or natural. I would assume a seller would confirm the purchaser wanted what they had in stock before sending it out.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this exact can in the stores, but worth every penny spent for shipping online. It holds my hair without that stiff feeling. And it doesnt ruin the body by weighing it down like most sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray! It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy!! Very fast shipping too!! Very good price too!</li>
            <li> Holds well without looking stiff.  The Salon I go to also uses it.  It is also well priced and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> the best hairspray.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This product does what is say - creates a hold that&#x27;s not too...crunchy. It&#x27;s flexible so you can move your hair or a brush through it. The only thing about this product is that it leaves my hair shiny...but not in a good way. It makes my hair look greasy and almost a little wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I think it&#x27;s a good hairspray...</li>
            <li> I have been looking so hard for a hair spray that will actually hold my curls. I have really super straight hair that my curls fall after about 2-3 hours of styling them. With the reviews, I thought this spray would hold my curls longer but alas, it doesn&#x27;t. If anyone knows of any sprays that would work best for my hair, I&#x27;d be glad to hear of them.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this hairspray a lot so there you go. It holds. She&#x27;s super hot, so it works! gg</li>
            <li> This holds without looking too set.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hairspray!!!!  It smells amazing, holds perfectly (not too hard, but doesn&#x27;t allow your hair to fly away either).  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people who also love the product, as well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> This has the best. I highly recommend. awesome stuff! chi is such a great product. you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order this.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend.  She loves it!  Doesn&#x27;t stink like normal hairspray and she likes the way it holds.</li>
            <li> This is a really great hair spray.  It holds the hair without being stiff.  It also allows for manipulating the hair right after spraying (moving the hair, scrunching, accenting the edges).  Has a very nice scent but not to heavy.  The can is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use. It holds great, plus it has a great scent to it.</li>
            <li> This is light hold hairspray and it smells divine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray for years but never ordered it from Amazon.  So, yes it&#x27;s a wonderful product that provides just enough hold but not so much you have a helmet head where your hair moves as one unit every time the wind blows.  And, the price on Amazon was cheaper than Ulta.</li>
            <li> The hairspray has a nice flexible hold, great for wearing hair curly or straight.  I also like the smell of the hairspray and that it doesn&#x27;t give you helmet hair.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has a really light hold, which is all I need.  I don&#x27;t use hairspray every day, but when I do, this is my go to.  Love the smell too, its light and I have guy friends who have commented on how they like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Always use this foru moms hair. Works great. Arrived on the date it was suppose to and the price was the same as we always pay for it in the salon she use to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and quick shipping.  The hairspray is light and still manages to hold my limp hair through humidity, would recommend it to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this because it&#x27;s similar to the one my stylist uses in the salon. I like the scent, it holds my style very well, but it isn&#x27;t as flexible as some other sprays.</li>
            <li> Perfect hairspray . Not too heavy and feels great</li>
            <li> This hairspray wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gave my heavy hair a little root lift with its hold like many others do&lt;br /&gt;2. Didn&#x27;t REEK of cologne! I smell like an 8th grade boy (think Curve Cologne)! The scent is so strong and lasts for a long time (I sprayed my hair last night and it still smells enough to make me nauseous now mid-morning). I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to scents, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this hairspray. Now to begin my hunt for another...</li>
            <li> The hairspray is a great hold. It is great for holding the style, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t wear your hair down to where it looks greasy or stiff. Just get it mostly dry or semi wet and spray a little, and it will maintain a firm hold all day long. The smell is good, not too strong, has a clean smell to it, and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, will be gone in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Used Shaper Plus but wanted to try something different - this has been an excellent option. Can&#x27;t decide, but I think I do like this one better...very llight and natural - almost too much so that I wonder if it will really work, LOL</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy and a LOT of hair and this stuff is magic!  It smells great (not perfumy or like chemicals or like candy/fruity).  It holds my style ALL day without drying or feeling heavy or sticky.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the goodness in this sleek and sexy red bottle!  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!  I&#x27;ve tried too many hairsprays to count and this one beats them all!  I hope they don&#x27;t ever change the formula or discontinue this one!!  If you want great hold with soft hair and movement TRY THIS!!</li>
            <li> Super light with a great smell. Doesn&#x27;t do well for a slick look but if you&#x27;re looking for anything messy or complex, this is the hairspray you want.</li>
            <li> Best lightweight hairspray at a great price! I used to use Bumble &amp; Bumble Classic Hairspray, but at almost double the price of CHI it isn&#x27;t worth it. Chi is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my opinion on this product was helpful to you :)!</li>
            <li> Smells great and holds really well! I like the tall, skinny bottle, but also I don&#x27;t bc it&#x27;s sort of awkward for storage.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. I have thick hair and this is the only spray thar can hold it without making my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Just the right amount of hold without overdoing it and adds shine.  Worth it.  Smells good as well.</li>
            <li> I have used CHI hairspray for years! It smells great and provides good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this product, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll hooked too!</li>
            <li> i live in a humid climate and my hair is frizzy so i use lots of hairspray after blowing it dry.  This is my favorite hairspray ever.  It softens up after being on my hair a while.  It holds well but is flexible.  Also, it smells really good, not at all like normal hairspray.</li>
            <li> The product itself is really good, however I have a problem with the can leaking the hairspray. It didn&#x27;t start leaking until I had used it several times. I love the smell of CHI!</li>
            <li> Very strong holding hair spray. I love Chi products, however this one is a little more stronger hold then I like.</li>
            <li> Looking for a fairly light hold hairspray, this is definitely a good buy! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel crunchy, and still easily moveable. I like the nice, light scent too!</li>
            <li> it does not hold my hair. I do not how it holds other people&#x27;s, i think my hair is too stiff idk</li>
            <li> This hairspray is a little pricier that I usually use and the smell is a bit overpowering for me but I have allergies and am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this Chi hair spray.  It&#x27;s strong enough to hold my short, curly hairstyle, but light enough to be able to run your fingers through your hair (depending on how much you use).  Plus, it has a great fragrance which is not obtrusive,</li>
            <li> It controlled the frizz and added shine to the hair.  A left it a bit crispy but if that is what it takes to control frizz then so be it.</li>
            <li> Love love love.... Holds my style all day yet combs right though at night ready for next day styling. It does what it says: style memory effect and great for crimping and all day curl holding. Really big bottle for long lasting spray.</li>
            <li> Saves my hair form heat damage!  But this all the time.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hairspray if you want natural hold.  It does not leave the hair stiff so I can now wash my hair every other day instead of every day</li>
            <li> I just received my product and will be disappointed in Amazon for the last time. I have been unhappy about Amazon for a while, particularly Amazon Prime but thought I&#x27;d give it another shot, even after a separate disappointing experience with another product.&lt;br /&gt;The cap of the hairspray was broken, in 3 pieces, the can is scratched up in several areas and now won&#x27;t spray at all. The disclaimer says this product cannot be returned as it is considered hazardous material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, you need to consider your shipping requirements and the types of vendors you work with (many of them sell fake products). I&#x27;m moving over to Google Shopping where you can trust the items you receive AND service is quicker.  Bye bye Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like a spray that holds but doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.  CHI Enviro 54 natural hold is awesome.  I&#x27;ve used this product over 2 years now and even though I don&#x27;t like paying the price - tight wad here - I can&#x27;t find any brand that I like better.  So I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive scalp problem &amp; had to stop haircolor &amp; hair products....don&#x27;t yet know why this problem has been brought about.  It has been very hard to manage my hair without hairspray ... so I have tried various brands, the alcohol free,etc .... but no luck, until I tried this Chi --- I still have itchiness, but use it occasionally when going out &amp; want to look put together.  It smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I luv this hairspray.......it does not make my hair 2 hard &amp; it holds all day........I will mos def buy this product again</li>
            <li> best flex hold hairspray ever</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this hairspray is the smell! Not too strong, but just enough to make you smell good:) It was completely worth the price for the huge bottle. The spray is not too sticky and does not make your hair super stiff, but it still holds it in place. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED HAIR SPRAY SINCE THE 60s. THIS IS THE BEST EVER AND THE FRAGRENCE IS WONDERFUL. I DO NOT LIKE CHEAP SPRAY HOLD AND SMELL. THIS HAS THE BEST OF THE BEST. I COULDNT FIND THIS IN STORES SO I HAD TO GET IT FROM THE INTERNET.  LOVE IT , YOU SHOULD TRY IT IF YOU NEED TO USE SPRAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHEWARRIOR53</li>
            <li> The Chi product I already bought before at Hair Salon in my city where I&#x27;m living, but I can save some bucks when I bought it at Amazon. It&#x27;s same quality, same product, but at lowest price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but I love the way it holds.</li>
