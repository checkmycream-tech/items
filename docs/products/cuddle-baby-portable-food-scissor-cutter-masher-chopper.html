            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want the rhinestone, but otherwise these are truly adorable and the perfect size for a newborn and up.  </li>
            <li>Would buy more for sure!</li>
            <li>But they are very cute &amp; worth it even if you don&#x27;t receive all of the colors!!  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I make most of my baby&#x27;s headbands.</li>
            <li>They are really cute.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for your baby girl, you will love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter looks so fancy in stylish everytime</li>
            <li>I chose this rating, 5 stars, because I Iove these flower headbands, they look so cute on my grandbaby.  </li>
            <li>They are totally cute</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this at a free or discounted rate for my unbiased and honest opinion/review.</li>
            <li>The flowers are cute, but I didn&#x27;t get what the seller claimed to be selling.</li>
            <li>These are really cute</li>
            <li>and I love how they look on my daughter.  </li>
            <li>These are so cute they look just like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>The gem is nice, not that cheap cloudy plastic looking gem that you see sometimes.</li>
            <li>Either change the product label or make sure they come with the headbands.</li>
            <li>I tried to pull it off with some pretty good force to be sure my infant couldn&#x27;t get it off</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess 6 headbands are a pretty good deal, though.</li>
            <li>Cute, but slides off easily.</li>
            <li>Great colors and soft material.</li>
            <li>These are much cuter than I expected,they are made from nice satin material,not cheap looking at all,they don&#x27;t slip off my 15 month old nieces head (these could fit anywhere from a newborn to a 3-4 year old easily)I&#x27;m very happy with these :)</li>
            <li>They slide of the head, I do not suggest these at all, and such a shame they are very cute!</li>
            <li>They also looked cheaply made with stringy glue hanging from them.</li>
            <li>These fit all 3 of my girls - 17 months, 3 1/2 and 5 years.</li>
            <li>The bands are just as pictured and they have felt under the flower so that it is comfortable for babies head.</li>
            <li>Worth more than what you pay</li>
            <li>They fit just right on my six month olds precious head</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase many items for the price I would normally pay for one in a store.</li>
            <li>This was a sweet purchase.</li>
            <li>The flower is backed with a nice piece of felt that will also be soft against the baby&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>I very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love them very soft on baby head and can be used up to toddler</li>
            <li>These will fit my 3mth old now and will grow with her for awhile because the headband stretches easily.  </li>
            <li>Today she turns 8 months old and is still able to wear them.  </li>
            <li>It does ship from China and took about 3 weeks, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Ordered these for 5mo old grand baby</li>
            <li>The headbands are a soft elastic that don&#x27;t leave marks on my baby&#x27;s head which I love.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, for my daughter.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 12 months old and they will fit her for years.  </li>
            <li>and I can use them with many different outfits for her.  </li>
            <li>The flowers are a soft satin material secured firmly to the headband and finished off with a beautiful rhinestone.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I will be ordering more of a different style.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really well made, very pretty, very soft.</li>
            <li>and also I especially like the red one it makes my daughter very cute.</li>
            <li>We really like them.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The product is clearly labeled &amp;#34;headbands&amp;#34; so I do not believe this an oversight by me, which was my first thought.</li>
            <li>They seem well made, and the 2 older ones can&#x27;t wait to wear them to ballet class.</li>
            <li>I tell everyone who asks where I purchased them and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t leave little dents in her head like some of the more ruffled  elastic ones do.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and the back of the bow has a very soft felt backing which I believe is why she doesn&#x27;t mind as they are not scratchy!!</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 4 month old at the time.</li>
            <li>Fits my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>These bows are high quality, soft, and my 12 month old daughter actually enjoys wearing them.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected them to look like</li>
            <li>Not too small lot too big perfect little accessory when I want to dress my baby up a little bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge issue but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Some are massive and look ridiculous but this is adorable and not too big.</li>
            <li>I did hot glue a little fleece to the bottom of the design to make it softer for her head.</li>
            <li>I expected the headband part to be larger--I have a 6 month old, and am not sure how long these will fit her.</li>

            <li> i got these for my 5 year old and she loves them, they aren&#x27;t to tight or uncomfortable(itchy)....</li>
            <li> I have a very crafty mother who fixed that problem but still very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Though the priduct reached very late than expected but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> that the little white rectangular pad that the flower is attached to shows a little when it&#x27;s being worn.</li>
            <li> I see some other people make mention of this problem as well.</li>
            <li> The rhinestone is secured tight on the headband.  </li>
            <li> I recommended these to all the women with little girls at my church....</li>
            <li> but I just tied a knot in the band to tighten it up a little.  </li>
            <li> My baby just turned 1 year, but has very little hair, average head size.</li>
            <li> the fabric is not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The jewels were missing from these.</li>
            <li> My baby is one, and all the head bands i found at the stores were very tight on her head, her hair hasn&#x27;t grown long for other types of hair pieces and it was frustrating.</li>
            <li> My baby HATES bows usually.</li>
            <li> I HATE when they are too tight and leave a mark.</li>
            <li> lame.</li>
            <li> Crazy</li>
            <li> but sadly they did not come as the picture showed!</li>
            <li> They look very expensive.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, for my daughter. They are beautiful headbands and she gets a lot of compliments when she is wearing them.</li>
            <li> I received the flowers but no headbands were attached to them. They also looked cheaply made with stringy glue hanging from them.</li>
            <li> These bows are high quality, soft, and my 12 month old daughter actually enjoys wearing them. Shipping was fast and I will be ordering more of a different style. Thank you!</li>
            <li> good quality and adorable!  My daughter is 12 months old and they will fit her for years.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but I expected that.  I was able to purchase many items for the price I would normally pay for one in a store.</li>
            <li> I expected the headband part to be larger--I have a 6 month old, and am not sure how long these will fit her. For the price, I guess 6 headbands are a pretty good deal, though. Just wondering why it came with (2) white ones--would have preferred 6 different colors.</li>
            <li> But they are very cute &amp; worth it even if you don&#x27;t receive all of the colors!!  A great buy!</li>
            <li> These fit all 3 of my girls - 17 months, 3 1/2 and 5 years. They seem well made, and the 2 older ones can&#x27;t wait to wear them to ballet class. The flower is the perfect size on their heads.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice on one of them that the little white rectangular pad that the flower is attached to shows a little when it&#x27;s being worn. It&#x27;s not a huge issue but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 month old at the time. They look great and are comfortable. Today she turns 8 months old and is still able to wear them.  They are well made. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great my little girl loves wearing headbands and bows so these are wonderful addition to her collection and a great price</li>
            <li> These are so cutie and look beautiful on our new great daughter!!!! They also will grow with her, that&#x27;s why I ordered them!!</li>
            <li> These headbands are absolutely beautiful! i got these for my 5 year old and she loves them, they aren&#x27;t to tight or uncomfortable(itchy)....I recommended these to all the women with little girls at my church....Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Adorable and great quality.  Big for my daughter (3 months) but I just tied a knot in the band to tighten it up a little.  Great colors and soft material.</li>
            <li> Very cute headbands! They are exactly what I expected them to look like so glad I got them! Im very pleased with my purchase!Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fits my 9 year old. Good quality</li>
            <li> I make most of my baby&#x27;s headbands. But saw these and couldn&#x27;t make them. They are really cute. One of my favorites we own, and we have over a hundred. My baby just turned 1 year, but has very little hair, average head size. These fit perfect. I HATE when they are too tight and leave a mark. I did hot glue a little fleece to the bottom of the design to make it softer for her head. These are a great value, couldn&#x27;t buy the materials to make it. It does ship from China and took about 3 weeks, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nieces, and it&#x27;s very cute. I recommend it for your baby girl, you will love it.</li>
            <li> These are the most adorable fancy headbands and for a great price. They have felt on the side where the flowers are providing comfort and perfect fit. My daughter looks so fancy in stylish everytime she wears these!!</li>
            <li> The bands are just as pictured and they have felt under the flower so that it is comfortable for babies head.</li>
            <li> These headbands are very cute and seem to be well made. I can&#x27;t wait to put them on my daughter.</li>
            <li> They slide of the head, I do not suggest these at all, and such a shame they are very cute!</li>
            <li> Used these for pictures. Super cute and very good color. Would buy more for sure! Look just like the pictures.</li>
            <li> My baby is one, and all the head bands i found at the stores were very tight on her head, her hair hasn&#x27;t grown long for other types of hair pieces and it was frustrating. These fit great and comfortable, plus they look great. Bough more models from them and continue to have a good experience.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating, 5 stars, because I Iove these flower headbands, they look so cute on my grandbaby.  I tell everyone who asks where I purchased them and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I waited a month to get this in the mail for my baby and I did not even receive headbands!! I only received the flower pieces, so now I guess I have to make my own headbands. Did they forget to sew on the elastic or what?? So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received the bows with nothing attached to them! No headbands, no clips, nothing. just a bow attached to a piece of felt! I don&#x27;t want to make my own headband! And these ship from China, so it is not like I am going to ship them back! lame.</li>
            <li> Just adorable! Great colors too!</li>
            <li> These are great, and a perfect selection for an awesome price.  I didn&#x27;t really want the rhinestone, but otherwise these are truly adorable and the perfect size for a newborn and up.  Some are massive and look ridiculous but this is adorable and not too big.</li>
            <li> It is elegant and beautiful and really wonderful I really like it I very pretty and also I especially like the red one it makes my daughter very cute.</li>
            <li> Cute, but slides off easily.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. and Fits in my daughters head. she also likes matching it with her outfits. the fabric is not cheap looking. well made.</li>
            <li> My baby HATES bows usually. However, these she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind! She doesn&#x27;t tug at them, or fuss. They are incredibly soft and the back of the bow has a very soft felt backing which I believe is why she doesn&#x27;t mind as they are not scratchy!! They are totally cute and I LOVE bows!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this at a free or discounted rate for my unbiased and honest opinion/review. My thoughts are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> We really liked the headband. Great for kids and will fit adults. This was a sweet purchase. We really like them. Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought these for my niece because the seller claimed these to be headbands. I got them in the mail with another set that I ordered &amp; to my surprise, the flowers had no elastic on them. So, I had to purchase fold over elastic so that I could make them into headbands. The flowers are cute, but I didn&#x27;t get what the seller claimed to be selling.</li>
            <li> I had the same issue. They were bows without the elastic band attached on a piece of felt. Not as pictured.  Crazy</li>
            <li> These are really cute and I love how they look on my daughter.  The head bands came in 6 different color and I can use them with many different outfits for her.  They are well made and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with them.</li>
            <li> They are perfect...very beautiful and band is more stretchable which do not hurt my babys head. She looks very cute and lovely on this. Though the priduct reached very late than expected but its worth it.</li>
            <li> These are so cute they look just like the picture shown. Not too small lot too big perfect little accessory when I want to dress my baby up a little bit .... CUTE!</li>
            <li> The jewels were missing from these. I just went and bought some to fix it but sadly they did not come as the picture showed!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Made nicely. Good material. The gem is nice, not that cheap cloudy plastic looking gem that you see sometimes.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for 5mo old grand baby and these are nice and they don&#x27;t leave little dents in her head like some of the more ruffled  elastic ones do. But they are not all the same size.</li>
            <li> These are so adorable and well made!!! They fit just right on my six month olds precious head and she looks so cute!</li>
            <li> These are much cuter than I expected,they are made from nice satin material,not cheap looking at all,they don&#x27;t slip off my 15 month old nieces head (these could fit anywhere from a newborn to a 3-4 year old easily)I&#x27;m very happy with these :)&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on these headbands in return I&#x27;m leaving my honest oppinion</li>
            <li> These headbands are perfect for my infant.  I loved the variety of colors that came with the pack of 6.  The headbands are a soft elastic that don&#x27;t leave marks on my baby&#x27;s head which I love.  The flower is backed with a nice piece of felt that will also be soft against the baby&#x27;s head.  The flowers are a soft satin material secured firmly to the headband and finished off with a beautiful rhinestone.  The rhinestone is secured tight on the headband.  I tried to pull it off with some pretty good force to be sure my infant couldn&#x27;t get it off and I couldn&#x27;t remove it with my hands. These will fit my 3mth old now and will grow with her for awhile because the headband stretches easily.  I can&#x27;t wait to show these off with her outfits!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> The flower pieces are GORGEOUS! They&#x27;re really well made, very pretty, very soft. I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t get the headbands with it. Lucky for me I have a very crafty mother who fixed that problem but still very disappointing. The product is clearly labeled &amp;#34;headbands&amp;#34; so I do not believe this an oversight by me, which was my first thought. I see some other people make mention of this problem as well. Seller should correct this problem asap. Either change the product label or make sure they come with the headbands.</li>
            <li> Colors weren&#x27;t what I thought they would be... didn&#x27;t see where it was just the flower, title of item misleading</li>
            <li> Worth more than what you pay I love them very soft on baby head and can be used up to toddler</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful, well made, just like the picture. They look very expensive.</li>
