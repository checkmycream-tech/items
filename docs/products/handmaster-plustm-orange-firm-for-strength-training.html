            <li>This thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>, this is an awesome and affordable tool!</li>
            <li>This is a strength tool best employed by persons looking to improve sporting performance, or those who have worked through the lower levels of Handmaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent item.</li>
            <li>Great idea,horrible product.</li>
            <li>Great challenge flexing and extending fingers.</li>
            <li>It works good and balances out the extensiion muscles of the hand.  </li>
            <li>An exceptional hand exercise device.</li>
            <li>This rehab tool was quite effective in helping me build strength and flexibility in the offended appendage as it</li>
            <li>Henry is quite fond of batting it around the apt.</li>
            <li>so i bought the &#x27;firm&#x27; strength one, so would have the best chance of it fitting my hand-NOPE!!!</li>
            <li>I still love it, as it does not show any new signs of any deterioration.. which is the best thing about this ball..</li>
            <li>good idea but need to make better fit strings.</li>
            <li>I love doctor Zachs inventions.</li>
            <li>I LOVEE YOUR INVENTION AND WOULD BE MORE ECSTATIC</li>
            <li>THANKYOU FOR THE PAIN FREE DaYS!</li>
            <li>Just received a Powerweb Combo unit for hand workouts, much much better and more versatile tool.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a squeeze ball or egg.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  satisfied  with  my  item</li>
            <li>Found it :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is still a great idea and cheap enough to give a try.</li>
            <li>Most of the grip training devices out there only work the squeezing in muscles, but this works the outward expansion of the fingers as well which, from what I understand, is a safer and more effective way to train grip</li>
            <li>This is a great idea with a simple clean design but the packaging and usage both miss the mark.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it, imho!</li>
            <li>honestly I know I would use this more if I could squish the ball a little more.  </li>
            <li>Works OK once it is on, but nobody uses it much because it is a hassle to get on.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li>I HAVE FOUND SO MUCH RELIEF WITH THESE HAND MASTER PLUS INVENTIONS!!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH DOC!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple yet so innovatingly more useful and hassle free than anything in the world.</li>
            <li>More challenging than i expected.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just right for my uninjured hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a climber for years, and had developed some imbalances in the forearm/elbow from the singular crushing grip leading to some chronic pain.</li>
            <li>Quality is great and seems like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>this product is just what it says it is very firm for those who have a good grip already but would like to increase their hand strength.</li>
            <li>When you do take this off, I recommend taking the top fingers out first, then the thumb; I find that if I do it the other way around, sometimes the thumb loop slides through the ball</li>
            <li>It might be better if bands of different resistance values where sold together with a single unit so that usage could be advanced accordingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use it very gingerly on my injured side.</li>
            <li>They wear out and its very discouraging..</li>
            <li>and this did the trick in making my hand much stronger..</li>
            <li>This ball and invention is very encouraging to continue my hobbies.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s so much if a pain to setup the finger loops</li>
            <li>The ball cracks within two weeks and the bands are very susceptible to breaking.</li>
            <li>I took the extension rubber band off to use by itself, and I don&#x27;t really use that either.  </li>
            <li>This is simple in design, but very useful.  </li>
            <li>There are other, better suited tools for that.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAD A NEW BALL MODEL THAT DOESNT BREAK!</li>
            <li>The little rubber band extension part is a good idea, but the finger holes are pretty small and kind of cut into your fingers sharply, and there&#x27;s not a ton of range of motion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product every other day for several weeks now, and it seems to be working effectively and holding up well.</li>
            <li>While the bands do break after several months of use, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be without it while waiting for the new one to ship.</li>
            <li>The resistance level is fairly challenging, much harder to squeeze than a regular stress ball.</li>
            <li>The directions say to put your thumb in first, then your pointer finger, middle finger, etc., and reverse the finger order when you take your fingers out.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I purchased the Handmaster Plus, and it&#x27;s a cool very small portable design, that I don&#x27;t really find myself using that much.  </li>
            <li>i am 40 years old.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can exercise flexor and extensor muscles makes this a complete hand and forearm exercise tool.</li>
            <li>While I wad biking to work an inconsiderate old codger doored me in the hand and broke my index finger.</li>
            <li>images show the ball placement directly over the palm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li>The box itself is full color but repeats the same same images on five sides rather than providing graphic instructions for assembly and use.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>The first broke a few months ago, and I realized the second probably wouldn&#x27;t last much longer than the first.</li>
            <li>tool is not for people to overcome arthritic pain or profound weakness.</li>
            <li>I skipped from red to orange in a pride jump which i now am regretting since i have developed new soreness in my hands and forearm making my tendonitis flare up these passed 2 weeks with thisnew ball.</li>
            <li>but a few seconds in the red ball and im fine again for another hour or two.</li>
            <li>I generally do 10x15 each hand every day, and get about two months out of it.</li>
            <li>So my only hint to you is to NOT skip medium after the red ball and go to the yellow which is the new ball</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usable, and after I use it for about a week I can definitely crush it a little more, but it&#x27;s just FIRM.  </li>
            <li>My red ball is BARELY hanging in there,, and the extra bands are whats helping me loosen up my carpal tunnel..</li>

            <li> My red ball is BARELY hanging in there,, and the extra bands are whats helping me loosen up my carpal tunnel..</li>
            <li> The orange ball is pretty stiff!  </li>
            <li> one &#x27;large&#x27; and the hole are so small it take both hands to get it on</li>
            <li> Opening my hand was awkward at first, but now it feels like the right resistance level.</li>
            <li> Durable materials will last a long while.</li>
            <li> The loops are a bit tight but nothing too uncomfortable but the ball itself isn&#x27;t nearly as firm as I thought it was going to be, I close it with relative ease, other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> extra resistance band is included in the box but it is the same resistance value as the other.  </li>
            <li> While I do have an opposable thumb, it is not polar to my fingers which means that I need to do some heavy contortions to get the ball centered over my palm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually stood on mine and rolled it around a little to try to loosen or soften it up...</li>
            <li> l wish the finger loops were a little bigger as it takes a wile to put it on.</li>
            <li> I get the &#x27;backwards&#x27; resistance to compensate for my hands being closed while rock climbing.</li>
            <li> I had only used it for a few weeks when the pain started subsiding, and my grip strength had noticeably</li>
            <li> But I do only a few sets at a time and am careful not to damage the loops taking my fingers in and out of them.</li>
            <li> it is made for tiny children or a small boy.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> If you buy this and struggle to extend your fingers or crush the ball, step down to one of the easier models.</li>
            <li> For my hands these were so tight that they stopped the blood flow in my already sore</li>
            <li> Hard to get the fingers through the loops, which are on the small side and the loops will pull on through the ball unless real care is taken, which is hard when the loops have to be forced over the fingers.</li>
            <li> On the advice of my chiropractor, I picked this little gem up.</li>
            <li> I recieved my firm ball in a timely manner..</li>
            <li> So i purchased a firm to help out my increasing hand strength</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FIRM BALL..</li>
            <li> I gave at least 5 different ones a try, unfortunately with the same results.</li>
            <li> THE LESS!</li>
            <li> strings are too tight and ball is very firm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions for the Handmaster are translated into at least six languages but printed in a font less than 4 points high and impossible to read.  </li>
            <li> The ball is very firm, so be prepared for quite a challenge there.</li>
            <li> To the person who complained about the 10 seconds it takes to slide your fingers into these loops: get rid of it.</li>
            <li> My tennis elbow was going away before I bought this, and it has continued to slowly improve using the Handmaster.</li>
            <li> The only downside that I find, which really isn&#x27;t bad at all, is that if I&#x27;m using this while I&#x27;m reading, or eating something, it can be cumbersome to take the rubber bands off of your fingers.</li>
            <li> Remember, this ball is VERY HARD..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying to put it back through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to bad, this product sucks.</li>
            <li> and i still have to &#x27;roll&#x27; the crap over my fingers and force it over my knuckels.</li>
            <li> you will get freedom from the worst pain in the world having to deal with at work.. typing even this</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every other day for several weeks now, and it seems to be working effectively and holding up well. My tennis elbow was going away before I bought this, and it has continued to slowly improve using the Handmaster. The finger loops show no signs of wear yet. But I do only a few sets at a time and am careful not to damage the loops taking my fingers in and out of them. The directions say to put your thumb in first, then your pointer finger, middle finger, etc., and reverse the finger order when you take your fingers out. This procedure makes it easier to get it on and off your hand and avoids putting undue stress on the finger loops. The resistance level is fairly challenging, much harder to squeeze than a regular stress ball. Opening my hand was awkward at first, but now it feels like the right resistance level. If you&#x27;re rehabbing an injury, I&#x27;d suggest getting one of the lower-resistance Handmasters instead. I&#x27;ve had to use it very gingerly on my injured side. But it&#x27;s just right for my uninjured hand.  Update 11/14/11: I just ordered my second handmaster plus. While the bands do break after several months of use, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20 I paid for it. My tennis elbow is 99% gone now, and I believe this product helped. It comes with two sets of finger bands. The first broke a few months ago, and I realized the second probably wouldn&#x27;t last much longer than the first. I&#x27;m ordering before it breaks so I won&#x27;t be without it while waiting for the new one to ship.</li>
            <li> I love doctor Zachs inventions. It&#x27;s so simple yet so innovatingly more useful and hassle free than anything in the world. I recieved my firm ball in a timely manner.. My only concern is to the others hoping to have a hand master that doesnt break.. Trust me you wont find one.. They wear out and its very discouraging.. So i purchased a firm to help out my increasing hand strength and this did the trick in making my hand much stronger.. however this strength training ball is LITTERALY for weght training.. You should be a body builder to need this specific ball. I skipped from red to orange in a pride jump which i now am regretting since i have developed new soreness in my hands and forearm making my tendonitis flare up these passed 2 weeks with thisnew ball. I still love it, as it does not show any new signs of any deterioration.. which is the best thing about this ball.. but hear me out.. THIS IS A FIRM BALL.. Like squeezing something unsqueezeable.. like squeezing a solid ball. So my only hint to you is to NOT skip medium after the red ball and go to the yellow which is the new ball i just ordered.   My red ball is BARELY hanging in there,, and the extra bands are whats helping me loosen up my carpal tunnel.. so remember.. Buy these balls in specific order, dont jump ahead... these balls wear out after months of usage.. you will get freedom from the worst pain in the world having to deal with at work.. typing even this hurts my hand.. but a few seconds in the red ball and im fine again for another hour or two. This ball and invention is very encouraging to continue my hobbies. Remember, this ball is VERY HARD.. And I ONLY RECOMEND THIS ONE IF YOUVE SURPASSED THE YELLOW MEDIUM BALL! AND OF COURSE THE RED BALL! GOODLUCK WITH YOUR TENDONITIS I HAVE FOUND SO MUCH RELIEF WITH THESE HAND MASTER PLUS INVENTIONS!! THANK YOU SO MUCH DOC!! JUST MAKE A SILICONE BALL INSTEAD OF A STYROFOAM LIKE BALL!! I LOVEE YOUR INVENTION AND WOULD BE MORE ECSTATIC IF YOU HAD A NEW BALL MODEL THAT DOESNT BREAK! I STILL 100 PERCENT BACK U UP NONE THE LESS! THANKYOU FOR THE PAIN FREE DaYS!</li>
            <li> it hurts wrist and hand bones. good idea but need to make better fit strings. strings are too tight and ball is very firm</li>
            <li> i am 40 years old. i have tendonitis now in my wrist/hand. i am a big dude, and i have man sized hands so i bought the &#x27;firm&#x27; strength one, so would have the best chance of it fitting my hand-NOPE!!! they come with two finger things, one med. one &#x27;large&#x27; and the hole are so small it take both hands to get it on and i still have to &#x27;roll&#x27; the crap over my fingers and force it over my knuckels. it is made for tiny children or a small boy. to bad, this product sucks.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to get the finger loops on and off. The ball is very firm, so be prepared for quite a challenge there. Honestly it&#x27;s so much if a pain to setup the finger loops I basically don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Great idea,horrible product. My guess is there was zero quality control performed prior to release of this item. The ball cracks within two weeks and the bands are very susceptible to breaking. I gave at least 5 different ones a try, unfortunately with the same results. Do NOT waist your money on this.</li>
            <li> The orange ball is pretty stiff!  I&#x27;m a rock climber and musician and figured this is the level I would need, but honestly I know I would use this more if I could squish the ball a little more.  It&#x27;s usable, and after I use it for about a week I can definitely crush it a little more, but it&#x27;s just FIRM.  I actually stood on mine and rolled it around a little to try to loosen or soften it up... nope.  The little rubber band extension part is a good idea, but the finger holes are pretty small and kind of cut into your fingers sharply, and there&#x27;s not a ton of range of motion.  Just received a Powerweb Combo unit for hand workouts, much much better and more versatile tool.  Finger extension is key is working hand and forearms, the same amount of muscles open and close the hand, but people almost exclusively work the closing muscles.  Balance in these muscles is key, the stronger your extensors get, the stronger your flexors can become.  That&#x27;s why I purchased the Handmaster Plus, and it&#x27;s a cool very small portable design, that I don&#x27;t really find myself using that much.  I took the extension rubber band off to use by itself, and I don&#x27;t really use that either.  It&#x27;s all about the Powerweb.</li>
            <li> An exceptional hand exercise device. Much better than a squeeze ball or egg. The fact that you can exercise flexor and extensor muscles makes this a complete hand and forearm exercise tool. I cannot recommend this enough. Buy one, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> While I wad biking to work an inconsiderate old codger doored me in the hand and broke my index finger. This rehab tool was quite effective in helping me build strength and flexibility in the offended appendage as it healed.&lt;br /&gt;Now my cat Henry is quite fond of batting it around the apt.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea with a simple clean design but the packaging and usage both miss the mark.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an extra resistance band in the box.  It is simple to assemble and use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;The ball comes separate from the bands and while an opened paper clip is suggested for threading the band through the ball, it is not included.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions for the Handmaster are translated into at least six languages but printed in a font less than 4 points high and impossible to read.  The box itself is full color but repeats the same same images on five sides rather than providing graphic instructions for assembly and use.&lt;br /&gt;An extra resistance band is included in the box but it is the same resistance value as the other.  It might be better if bands of different resistance values where sold together with a single unit so that usage could be advanced accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;this product uses a five point resistance band which is a &amp;#34;one size fits some&amp;#34;.  For my hands these were so tight that they stopped the blood flow in my already sore hands.&lt;br /&gt;The images show the ball placement directly over the palm.  While I do have an opposable thumb, it is not polar to my fingers which means that I need to do some heavy contortions to get the ball centered over my palm.&lt;br /&gt;this is still a great idea and cheap enough to give a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  satisfied  with  my  item</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I get the &#x27;backwards&#x27; resistance to compensate for my hands being closed while rock climbing. To the person who complained about the 10 seconds it takes to slide your fingers into these loops: get rid of it. It isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I tend to neglect the extensor muscles in my hands. The loops are a bit tight but nothing too uncomfortable but the ball itself isn&#x27;t nearly as firm as I thought it was going to be, I close it with relative ease, other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> I got this to strengthen my grips for Brazilian Jiujitsu and Judo practice and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Most of the grip training devices out there only work the squeezing in muscles, but this works the outward expansion of the fingers as well which, from what I understand, is a safer and more effective way to train grip strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only downside that I find, which really isn&#x27;t bad at all, is that if I&#x27;m using this while I&#x27;m reading, or eating something, it can be cumbersome to take the rubber bands off of your fingers. When you do take this off, I recommend taking the top fingers out first, then the thumb; I find that if I do it the other way around, sometimes the thumb loop slides through the ball and it&#x27;s annoying to put it back through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Other than that, this is an awesome and affordable tool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a climber for years, and had developed some imbalances in the forearm/elbow from the singular crushing grip leading to some chronic pain. On the advice of my chiropractor, I picked this little gem up. I had only used it for a few weeks when the pain started subsiding, and my grip strength had noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is not for people to overcome arthritic pain or profound weakness. There are other, better suited tools for that. If you buy this and struggle to extend your fingers or crush the ball, step down to one of the easier models. It&#x27;s really that simple. This is a strength tool best employed by persons looking to improve sporting performance, or those who have worked through the lower levels of Handmaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the rubber band breaks, and isn&#x27;t sold separately. I generally do 10x15 each hand every day, and get about two months out of it. Well worth it, imho!</li>
            <li> It works good and balances out the extensiion muscles of the hand.  l wish the finger loops were a little bigger as it takes a wile to put it on.</li>
            <li> this product is just what it says it is very firm for those who have a good grip already but would like to increase their hand strength.</li>
            <li> This is simple in design, but very useful.  The finger placements were well thought out.  BTW if you&#x27;re looking into getting this to practice on your grip, might as well go with this one and not the easier ones.  This one is pretty easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the fingers through the loops, which are on the small side and the loops will pull on through the ball unless real care is taken, which is hard when the loops have to be forced over the fingers. Works OK once it is on, but nobody uses it much because it is a hassle to get on.</li>
            <li> As a rock climber I was looking for a device for hand therapy and building up hand/finger strength.....Found it :) Quality is great and seems like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. More challenging than i expected. Great challenge flexing and extending fingers. Durable materials will last a long while.</li>
