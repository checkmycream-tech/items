            <li>This is very important.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a Facial Steamer this is the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one facial in my life and it was a wonderful experience.  </li>
            <li>and I wish I had more time to do it every day.  </li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and this facial steamer is perfect for giving facials.</li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement part of my mini facial the part fit perfect.</li>
            <li>This Steamer was recommended to me by joy Aesthetician because it has the wand to put drops of the Tea Tree Oil and get a nice facial steam.  </li>
            <li>Purchased in 2012 from a fantastic seller, enjoyed once a week for a year.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The steamer has been used alot so far my wife claims it does a great job the adjustable arm seems to enable the user to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>It heats up in 5 mins and provides a good steady stream of steam for about 20 mins if you fill up the water to the max line.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine until the water started boiling</li>
            <li>This design is wonderful for getting a really professional steam all over since you can turn your head and direct the mist where ever you want it.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face, feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It contracts pores during the steaming process, for a smooth skin look.  </li>
            <li>Remember everything you do in front of the steamer will make it be absorbed quicker and more</li>
            <li>The swivel arm is important as you can target areas.</li>
            <li>SatinSmooth website is evasive and replacement parts don&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
            <li>The steam is relatively good but the handle is so hot, you have to use a pot holder and it drips steaming hot water</li>
            <li>I believe what keeps mine running smoothly is the attention to clean up.</li>
            <li>: This is an update since 2012 when I originally purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely lucky I was not using this on a client at the time.</li>
            <li>Instead of paying to get a facial I do my own at home and in the process saves me money.</li>
            <li>steamer includes an extender arm, the adjoining end of the extender arm which has a grooved &#x27;cap&#x27; and rubber liner to secure it to the short arm attached on the top of the steamer.</li>
            <li>Three years tells me that I have been doing the right thing to take care of it.</li>
            <li>The steamer is easy to use and so far doesn&#x27;t have any defects (i.e. spraying steam).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even type very fast before I used my hands to cover my face</li>
            <li>Love this Facial Steamer.  </li>
            <li>Then, the hot water splashed all over me.</li>
            <li>Next, use your favorite scrub or face wash while still in front of the steamer.</li>
            <li>The water container does get really hot</li>
            <li>**) this one you can rotate it around any way you want and when the steam goes on it gets hott</li>
            <li>This professional table top facial steamer works great and just as well as the more expensive version used by the professionals.  </li>
            <li>two i wish it had more functions like say you want to adjust how much steam you want or dont want it doesnt have that it only has a power switch and a ozone</li>
            <li>As a woman, I happen to like the look of it sitting there, so I&#x27;m fine with simply moving it to my counter or vanity when I want to use it.</li>
            <li>highly suggest any person to get this exact model.</li>
            <li>so having it drip was too much for me.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth the next day</li>
            <li>Steamer is ready within 3 minutes, and I like the ozone option (because I know using distilled/purified water is preferred, but well life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B002FWW8HY Professional Table Top Facial Steamer]]</li>
            <li>Was a great little steamer for the first month or two; quick to steam, lasts long enough for full length facial.</li>
            <li>but i have 2 down sides bout this steamer one i wish the steam would be a bit more thicker and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I had read other reviews of that happening but mine works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I only use distilled water and right after my session is over</li>
            <li>When the water bowl is cool to the touch I twist that off and rinse that too and set it to air dry.</li>
            <li>Been using this for over four years, and bought a new one now.</li>
            <li>I felt this facial mist steamer was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>So far, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, the steamer tube basically melted and broke into a bunch of pieces causing burning hot water to drip all over me.</li>
            <li>Also very affordable and a nice option to expensive salon facials.</li>
            <li>great facial streamer but not perfect before i bought this one i had another one it was like the bowl</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 20yr old daughter .</li>
            <li>I start with a cotton pad and which hazel *toner and astringent found in the pharmacy department usually near wound care in Walmart</li>
            <li>As an esthetician, I wanted a steamer aside from my professional steamer that I can travel with in ease.</li>
            <li>So to date it is about 3 years old.</li>
            <li>, I will consider investing in a professional grade steamer, understand customer care and warranty info and seek smarter design.</li>
            <li>(I do not recommend the smaller version for anyone, it is just too small, or the super large one unless your a professional and the machine runs all day).</li>
            <li>After waiting a few minutes I pop off the head of the arm to cool it off, then the arm.</li>
            <li>It is like getting a facial from a professional.  </li>
            <li>This adjoining section broke down after a year, cracked and leaked steam and dripped incredibly hot water.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s overall footprint is small enough that I can easily set it on the edge of my bathtub for \\&quot;storage.\\&quot;(I would not use it or any electrical appliance while in the bathtub.)</li>
            <li>and I just ordered a new tabletop steamer because this one is already not working properly after only 10 facials.</li>

            <li> Poor value, missing opportunity to build brand loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The steamer tube is very difficult to maneuver and sometimes when you do find the proper angle the steam flow stops.</li>
            <li> This steamer had the absolute worst plastic smell that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> To replace broken parts.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst product I have ever ordered.</li>
            <li> The water canister is awkward to remove, once unlocked the user must turn the canister horizontal to move it out of the metal heating ring.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Love this Facial Steamer.  It works fantastic.  It is like getting a facial from a professional.  It leaves my face, feeling so smooth.  It contracts pores during the steaming process, for a smooth skin look.  I highly recommend it.  It is easy to use.  Just have to wait for the water to warm up.</li>
            <li> I regularly see an esthetician for facials.  This professional table top facial steamer works great and just as well as the more expensive version used by the professionals.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  [[ASIN:B002FWW8HY Professional Table Top Facial Steamer]]</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 20yr old daughter . The steamer has been used alot so far my wife claims it does a great job the adjustable arm seems to enable the user to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two months ago, it does the job well. My face seems to be healthier and cleaner everytime I use it. Instead of paying to get a facial I do my own at home and in the process saves me money. I&#x27;m one happy buyer!</li>
            <li> Well made product, have used it several times in my salon.  So far, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I just got it today, decided try it. I install it as instructed, then fill the water, turned it on. Everything was fine until the water started boiling and I see the water rushing from the tube along with the steam. Then, the hot water splashed all over me. I have multiple burns right now and am very angry at this product. Girls, don&#x27;t let other reviews fool you..... I can&#x27;t even type very fast before I used my hands to cover my face so I don&#x27;t get burned. Please do not buy this product. 1st time writing a review because I just have to!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a while ago and it is incredible! If your looking for a Facial Steamer this is the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest any person to get this exact model. It is the perfect size for 1 person to sit and have plenty of steam for one session (I do not recommend the smaller version for anyone, it is just too small, or the super large one unless your a professional and the machine runs all day). It has an automatic off after it runs out of water *for safety although always best to turn your machine off* It also has the Ozon feature.  This is very important. It provides the cleanest, soothing and relaxing steam.  It is always best to start the steamer *full to line with DISTILLED water*, Set up your facial products then sit in front of the steamer. I start with a cotton pad and which hazel *toner and astringent found in the pharmacy department usually near wound care in Walmart* wipe face then let steam relax your face and open pores. Next, use your favorite scrub or face wash while still in front of the steamer. The steamer helps your product be more effective. Then rinse.  After rinsing, pat face dry then continue to sit in front of the steamer repeat the which hazel *as above* then put on your favorite lotions or creams! Remember everything you do in front of the steamer will make it be absorbed quicker and more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;Katie&lt;br /&gt;Coweta, Ok</li>

            <li> This is by far the worst product I have ever ordered. As an esthetician, I wanted a steamer aside from my professional steamer that I can travel with in ease. This steamer had the absolute worst plastic smell that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of no matter what I did. The second time I used it, the steamer tube basically melted and broke into a bunch of pieces causing burning hot water to drip all over me. I am extremely lucky I was not using this on a client at the time. This was completely a waste and if I didn&#x27;t throw away the box I would have returned it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> It is portable, easy to use, and works great. Also very affordable and a nice option to expensive salon facials.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tabletop facial steamer for my business on 9/20/13. Today is October 2, 2013 and I just ordered a new tabletop steamer because this one is already not working properly after only 10 facials. The steamer tube is very difficult to maneuver and sometimes when you do find the proper angle the steam flow stops. It also started dripping 2 weeks ago making for a nervous esthetician. You have to get this steamer fairly close to the clients face in order for them to feel the steam so having it drip was too much for me. I cannot risk having a client experience a burn because of dripping. Also, the aromatherapy cover fell off about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I think this item was returned.  There was dust and hairs in the steam wand.  Didn&#x27;t even turn it on, just returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size steamer for use at home. The lady that I get my facials done from uses this so I ordered one to use once or twice a week at home. It heats up in 5 mins and provides a good steady stream of steam for about 20 mins if you fill up the water to the max line. The water container does get really hot so you have to wait a bit before removing it. Besides that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and she is very happy with it. She says that it works perfectly and gives a great sensation to the skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over four years, and bought a new one now. Life saver. A must have for anyone with sinus issues, or allergies.</li>
            <li> I felt this facial mist steamer was very reasonably priced. It it a little bulky with its long, extended misting arm -- but that extension is a plus also so I&#x27;m not really complaining. The product&#x27;s overall footprint is small enough that I can easily set it on the edge of my bathtub for \\&quot;storage.\\&quot;(I would not use it or any electrical appliance while in the bathtub.) As a woman, I happen to like the look of it sitting there, so I&#x27;m fine with simply moving it to my counter or vanity when I want to use it. I&#x27;ve had facial-width steamers before and felt like they only misted the front oval of my face. This design is wonderful for getting a really professional steam all over since you can turn your head and direct the mist where ever you want it.</li>
            <li> great facial streamer but not perfect before i bought this one i had another one it was like the bowl and you stick your face in it but that one was a pos(piece of ****) this one you can rotate it around any way you want and when the steam goes on it gets hott but i have 2 down sides bout this steamer one i wish the steam would be a bit more thicker and two i wish it had more functions like say you want to adjust how much steam you want or dont want it doesnt have that it only has a power switch and a ozone switch(i still am not sure what the ozone switch even does) other then that it is a very great item i say get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one facial in my life and it was a wonderful experience.  Now I can have one anytime I want!  The steamer is easy to use and so far doesn&#x27;t have any defects (i.e. spraying steam).  I had read other reviews of that happening but mine works just fine.  My face is so smooth the next day and I wish I had more time to do it every day.  Initially I thought the unit was too expensive but it&#x27;s the same price as one visit to the salon to have it done so it pays for itself in a very short time.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  The steam is relatively good but the handle is so hot, you have to use a pot holder and it drips steaming hot water so don&#x27;t get too close or you will get burned.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and this facial steamer is perfect for giving facials. It is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015: This is an update since 2012 when I originally purchased it. So to date it is about 3 years old. I use it often enough to see how it handles wear and tear. I have to say it is still holding up. I believe what keeps mine running smoothly is the attention to clean up. I only use distilled water and right after my session is over I unplug the unit from the wall and twist off the water plug so that it starts to release any pressure and heat. After waiting a few minutes I pop off the head of the arm to cool it off, then the arm. I take those items to the sink and rinse them thoroughly and set them to air dry. When the water bowl is cool to the touch I twist that off and rinse that too and set it to air dry. After everything is dry (usually overnight) I put it all back together and store it. Easy! Three years tells me that I have been doing the right thing to take care of it. I would suggest not to fill up the entire water bowl with water at the begining of your steam session. Use the Fill Line or slightly below, it will be easier for you to screw off the bowl and empty the remaining water at the end of your session without making a mess.By the way, it has worked great for my skin, hydrates and cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> Purchased in 2012 from a fantastic seller, enjoyed once a week for a year. The swivel arm is important as you can target areas. Steamer is ready within 3 minutes, and I like the ozone option (because I know using distilled/purified water is preferred, but well life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.satinsmooth.com/product_info.php?pcID&#x3D;82_126&amp;products_id&#x3D;473&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer includes an extender arm, the adjoining end of the extender arm which has a grooved &#x27;cap&#x27; and rubber liner to secure it to the short arm attached on the top of the steamer. This adjoining section broke down after a year, cracked and leaked steam and dripped incredibly hot water. The water canister is awkward to remove, once unlocked the user must turn the canister horizontal to move it out of the metal heating ring. If there is water in the canister, spilling water is a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SatinSmooth website is evasive and replacement parts don&#x27;t seem to be available. I am in process of finding a manufacturer contact to inquire about replacement arm, and have been unsuccessful. The website does not provide customer service information and the Contact Us link at the bottom of the page directs you to a link to logon before you can proceed http://www.satinsmooth.com/login.php. The company willfully avoids contact with the consumer. Poor value, missing opportunity to build brand loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I will consider investing in a professional grade steamer, understand customer care and warranty info and seek smarter design. I do not plan to purchase from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Works excellent!! My beauty school uses them and very happy with them too</li>
            <li> Was a great little steamer for the first month or two; quick to steam, lasts long enough for full length facial. Problems began when plastic hinged oil cover broke off; used rubber bands to hold it on. After 4-5 months of 1 time per weel use, wand area all around oil chamber began to fall apart. No online parts avail. To replace broken parts. Also began to drip and leak out of steam area- had to discontinue use.</li>
