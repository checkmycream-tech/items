            <li>but we share it because it&#x27;s stunning!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty wonderful for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just looks so real perfect for people who have no hair at all and dont want to spend hundreds on a wig and perfect for people like me who have hair and just flat wanted to be able to change style and color once in a wile without the hassle of dye</li>
            <li>real comfortable...</li>
            <li>and it turn out to be amazing on me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and it is basically all-around excellent!</li>
            <li>The bangs don&#x27;t fall as nicely as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Would be nice for costume wear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never ordered a wig before, so I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fullness to it and the BANGS</li>
            <li>I used this wig for a costume during the day, and then for fun, since it looked so good, I wore it out for dinner that night!  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to style and tend to stay where you put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was lookin pretty good!</li>
            <li>So, the &amp;#34;faults&amp;#34; are probably my own problem and not faults in the product. :)</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product for a first time wig user.</li>
            <li>about to my shoulders, I got this to wear as a protective style and to play around in mostly for the winter days.</li>
            <li>You will love this wig.</li>
            <li>But all in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came with a cap</li>
            <li>I love tjis wig.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought tons of wigs from cosplay to just trying to find something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking for covering up my rainbow hair, and this one was perfect for hiding my blue hair from my boss!</li>
            <li>If looking for a cheap nice wig i would suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I just cut about an inch or so off the ends which made it a bit more managable</li>
            <li>and I was able to wear the wig all night without being itchy...</li>
            <li>For the price though, not terrible.</li>
            <li>I love the length as well.</li>
            <li>The wig quality is great and it almost looks real.</li>
            <li>it was ok.</li>
            <li>It came in only two days and was a WONDERFUL quality.</li>
            <li>It was packed well, and even came with a free wig cap!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I would for sure recommend this wig and WILL be getting more.</li>
            <li>Ok ya&#x27;ll...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and i hope it&#x27;ll be much better than when i received it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable, and it looks very full.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hair and great shade of black.</li>
            <li>looks great, rather tangled but when brushed through with a wig brush it was nice and silky soft,&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could make the wig fit appropriately</li>
            <li>about 5&#x27;2\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;very nice wig for the price, came around when it said it would, so i&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li>the wig is beautiful and very soft and the area where the hair parted had a little skin cap thing on it :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set it up.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and maintainable the length is amazing and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li>but that is true of most wigs.</li>
            <li>It was light to wear and easy to play with and style.</li>
            <li>bought this as part of a vampire costume and it works fine for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy to wear wig with really smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li>felt like cheap wig hair</li>
            <li>It even comes with a wig cap and adjustable straps for a custom fit.</li>
            <li>Was happy that it came with a wig cap, but it the condition the wig is in, I will likely not even wear it.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>This wig looks amazing, and didnt cost much at all.</li>
            <li>The curls were more waves than curls, the bangs were much longer than in the picture!</li>
            <li>I was very excited when it arrived because it&#x27;s my first wig that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and silky, and flows nicely.</li>
            <li>The wig shedded but still looked good enough to wear will buy again</li>
            <li>I love this wig and highly recomd getting it!</li>
            <li>It comes with it&#x27;s own wig cap, the hair feels / looks somewhat natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good deal, we would recommend.</li>
            <li>&amp;#62;_&amp;#60; Very nice, soft, believable wig that contained zero white bugs and wasn&#x27;t overly shiny.</li>
            <li>it was not black but it was a nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, and it&#x27;s still good!</li>
            <li>I love this wig, and I hope to use it for more occasions in the future!</li>
            <li>Highly unsanitary, and a sure sign of improper storage.</li>
            <li>Well, the wig is very pretty, and for the price...</li>
            <li>I was always curious about wigs and after reading some of the reviews on various wigs I decided to try this one since it had good reviews and good price.</li>
            <li>I got complements all day about how pretty my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; looked and once i said it was a wig the would not believe me!</li>
            <li>This wig looks exactly like it does in amazons picture!</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this wig, it was going to be my first wig purchase</li>
            <li>It was a bit harsh in the heat, but besides that, this wig is great.</li>
            <li>but it comes with an amazing hair net!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was so cheap and my expectations were met.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, it&#x27;s so soft and silky feeling to the touch.  </li>
            <li>fun to play with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly itchy, especially with a wig cap (a free one came with the wig).</li>
            <li>This wig was bought just for fun, and at the cheap price I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package</li>
            <li>This hair is long and you can brush it to give it more volume or if you want to give it a more realistic look.</li>
            <li>Adorable wig, true to color, but came in a tangled mess that took hours to sort out and smooth before the cosplay event.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly buy again!</li>
            <li>but it still appeared black so its all good</li>
            <li>This wig is a gorgeous black color, and it looks so real!</li>
            <li>I like the wig and it looked very real.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my new piece of wig up</li>
            <li>it just looked like a big ball of hair, but it was super easy to brush out and b4</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy this brand of wig again.</li>
            <li>First of all the wig was delivered superfast....within two days.</li>
            <li>so I just tossed the item, but just make sure to check the wigs prior to putting them on...</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;m pretty content with my purchase and would recommend</li>
            <li>It looks and feels real!</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this is the first wig I have ever owned, so my opinion is not expert.  </li>
            <li>But thats ok because I only bought it to ware it in a ponytail</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it anything more than the 3 stars because it just seems so frizzy when you first get it and did take time to make it look less like a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>The wig is so nice and soft, it looks real for a wig and has as good as quality as some of the more expensive wigs!</li>
            <li>its such a wonderful wig the only thing is its soooo long for my height</li>
            <li>It also tangled when I was trying it on a little bit, but I hear a wig brush and a bit of detangler will help with that; I was also kind of struggling with it, because it&#x27;s my first wig ever, so that might explain it.</li>
            <li>While it may take a while to ship if you live in the states , it is definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Looks different from picture not as long as it shows comes to my shoulders but good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Loved the texture of it, came in earlier then expected and works out with what I have, thanks to you!</li>
            <li>Its soft and light weight and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>This wig was so realistic looking!</li>
            <li>and it really Curly  and</li>
            <li>I cant complain too much</li>
            <li>The hair looks real and some people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Not trying to fool people that it is real, but some think it is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is very silky feeling and not overly</li>
            <li>And since it came all the way from China, that was fast.</li>
            <li>it tangles to much and to shinning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very manageable, even though it tangles a bit(but</li>
            <li>Maybe another weft would have filled it out enough.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, it was what I expected, good length and curls</li>
            <li>Its also much higher quality and feels more realistic than any other wig</li>
            <li>Very long and tangles easily at the ends.</li>
            <li>Look good in pictures though, so if you only want it to wear for a picture or at a dark movie theater</li>
            <li>this is my first wig, and it actually is not bad at all.the hair comes out if u try to brush it too much,but it looks natural enough to be worn and not look like a wig.</li>
            <li>Because the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is synthetic, it is subject to static electricity, so that wisps of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; cling to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Black Full Wavy Women&#x27;s Wig Long Curly Lady&#x27;s Wigs is cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of big for my head and feels a little uncomfortable but it&#x27;s very pretty and a good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>because looks so natural!!</li>
            <li>This is the second wig I have bought from Taobaopit, and they never fail to please!</li>
            <li>The little trim solved the problem and made the overall look more full and natural.  </li>
            <li>Very silky and soft to touch</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it starts to tangle after a couple of uses, but that happens with most wigs and can be easily fixed with proper care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy a few more in case the one we have gets ratty.</li>
            <li>The wig is certainly similar to the picture and it feels pretty real.</li>
            <li>This wig is every bit as gorgeous as the picture shows, but it is just a teeny bit thin.  </li>
            <li>I live in California, and got it in 19 days.</li>
            <li>I looked a absolute complete mess!:xlol I did not look right with long hair at all.</li>
            <li>I email the seller and told him the problem they said they will send me the right color I&#x27;m still waiting  not to happy at all false headline when order this wig  just to let you know if you want a black wig your not going to get it mine</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Plus it came early !</li>
            <li>I am a regular customer of Amazon, as well as an avid wig wearer.</li>
            <li>It sheds a little, and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t anything a quick finger fluff and bang trim</li>
            <li>It is super soft, and it does tangle slightly, but that is true to any long wig.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The length is perfect: the longest part ends around my bra strap, so a few inches above the small of my back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a large head, but this wig made me feel like I had double the size.  </li>
            <li>It looks really natural, and its not too shiny.  </li>
            <li>I feel like having long pretty hair.</li>
            <li>The wig it self just look to fake and to shining and easy to get tangle quick..</li>
            <li>but looks cute none the less, its comfy and airy so its not too heavy wont sweat too much under it</li>
            <li>Sexy, long enough to have in other style.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad wig, but the part is a little off.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a bit odd at first when you put them on, but don&#x27;t be discouraged!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my real hair short and punky but I didn&#x27;t want my wedding photos to show short hair..</li>
            <li>It looks very natural on me, and I have naturally blonde hair!</li>
            <li>It does run a little small which means because it is not hookable, more prone to be snatched off!</li>
            <li>Unless your not lazy enough to refix it.</li>
            <li>It is obviously a wig (it is clearly synthetic fiber, not hair) and it tangles quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed and have my hair natural</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the package, I also sound a white bug, and a few white flakes too</li>
            <li>it seems a little curlier than the pics but seeing as this is my first wig</li>
            <li>That longest section of hair was quite thin and whispy, causing that area to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>And the amount that I could pull it on, it was still too round on top (but that was because it was too small for my head.)</li>
            <li>Took it out package gave it a little shake and it was ready to wear.</li>
            <li>While I was happy with the wig, I was disgusted to find a large white bug embedded in the wig.</li>

            <li> It was nicely made and looked so great.</li>
            <li> Loved it</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good wig.</li>
            <li> the wig came quickly and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> love this, great quality, nobody realized it was a wig when I took it off at dress rehearsal.</li>
            <li> Okay I just received the wig yesterday, and it&#x27;s a very nice one</li>
            <li> but we share it because it&#x27;s stunning!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty wonderful for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just looks so real perfect for people who have no hair at all and dont want to spend hundreds on a wig and perfect for people like me who have hair and just flat wanted to be able to change style and color once in a wile without the hassle of dye</li>
            <li> real comfortable...</li>
            <li> and it turn out to be amazing on me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and it is basically all-around excellent!</li>
            <li> The bangs don&#x27;t fall as nicely as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Would be nice for costume wear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered a wig before, so I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fullness to it and the BANGS</li>
            <li> I used this wig for a costume during the day, and then for fun, since it looked so good, I wore it out for dinner that night!  </li>
            <li> They are very easy to style and tend to stay where you put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was lookin pretty good!</li>
            <li> So, the &amp;#34;faults&amp;#34; are probably my own problem and not faults in the product. :)</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product for a first time wig user.</li>
            <li> about to my shoulders, I got this to wear as a protective style and to play around in mostly for the winter days.</li>
            <li> You will love this wig.</li>
            <li> But all in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came with a cap</li>
            <li> I love tjis wig.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of wigs from cosplay to just trying to find something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking for covering up my rainbow hair, and this one was perfect for hiding my blue hair from my boss!</li>
            <li> If looking for a cheap nice wig i would suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I just cut about an inch or so off the ends which made it a bit more managable</li>
            <li> and I was able to wear the wig all night without being itchy...</li>
            <li> For the price though, not terrible.</li>
            <li> I love the length as well.</li>
            <li> The wig quality is great and it almost looks real.</li>
            <li> it was ok.</li>
            <li> It came in only two days and was a WONDERFUL quality.</li>
            <li> It was packed well, and even came with a free wig cap!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I would for sure recommend this wig and WILL be getting more.</li>
            <li> Ok ya&#x27;ll...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and i hope it&#x27;ll be much better than when i received it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was very comfortable, and it looks very full.  </li>
            <li> Very nice hair and great shade of black.</li>
            <li> looks great, rather tangled but when brushed through with a wig brush it was nice and silky soft,&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could make the wig fit appropriately</li>
            <li> about 5&#x27;2\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;very nice wig for the price, came around when it said it would, so i&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li> the wig is beautiful and very soft and the area where the hair parted had a little skin cap thing on it :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set it up.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and maintainable the length is amazing and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li> but that is true of most wigs.</li>
            <li> It was light to wear and easy to play with and style.</li>
            <li> bought this as part of a vampire costume and it works fine for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy to wear wig with really smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li> felt like cheap wig hair</li>
            <li> It even comes with a wig cap and adjustable straps for a custom fit.</li>
            <li> Was happy that it came with a wig cap, but it the condition the wig is in, I will likely not even wear it.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing, and didnt cost much at all.</li>
            <li> The curls were more waves than curls, the bangs were much longer than in the picture!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when it arrived because it&#x27;s my first wig that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and silky, and flows nicely.</li>
            <li> The wig shedded but still looked good enough to wear will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this wig and highly recomd getting it!</li>
            <li> It comes with it&#x27;s own wig cap, the hair feels / looks somewhat natural.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good deal, we would recommend.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; Very nice, soft, believable wig that contained zero white bugs and wasn&#x27;t overly shiny.</li>
            <li> it was not black but it was a nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, and it&#x27;s still good!</li>
            <li> I love this wig, and I hope to use it for more occasions in the future!</li>
            <li> Highly unsanitary, and a sure sign of improper storage.</li>
            <li> Well, the wig is very pretty, and for the price...</li>
            <li> I was always curious about wigs and after reading some of the reviews on various wigs I decided to try this one since it had good reviews and good price.</li>
            <li> I got complements all day about how pretty my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; looked and once i said it was a wig the would not believe me!</li>
            <li> This wig looks exactly like it does in amazons picture!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this wig, it was going to be my first wig purchase</li>
            <li> It was a bit harsh in the heat, but besides that, this wig is great.</li>
            <li> but it comes with an amazing hair net!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was so cheap and my expectations were met.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, it&#x27;s so soft and silky feeling to the touch.  </li>
            <li> fun to play with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly itchy, especially with a wig cap (a free one came with the wig).</li>
            <li> This wig was bought just for fun, and at the cheap price I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package</li>
            <li> This hair is long and you can brush it to give it more volume or if you want to give it a more realistic look.</li>
            <li> Adorable wig, true to color, but came in a tangled mess that took hours to sort out and smooth before the cosplay event.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> but it still appeared black so its all good</li>
            <li> This wig is a gorgeous black color, and it looks so real!</li>
            <li> I like the wig and it looked very real.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my new piece of wig up</li>
            <li> it just looked like a big ball of hair, but it was super easy to brush out and b4</li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy this brand of wig again.</li>
            <li> First of all the wig was delivered superfast....within two days.</li>
            <li> so I just tossed the item, but just make sure to check the wigs prior to putting them on...</li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;m pretty content with my purchase and would recommend</li>
            <li> It looks and feels real!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this is the first wig I have ever owned, so my opinion is not expert.  </li>
            <li> But thats ok because I only bought it to ware it in a ponytail</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it anything more than the 3 stars because it just seems so frizzy when you first get it and did take time to make it look less like a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> The wig is so nice and soft, it looks real for a wig and has as good as quality as some of the more expensive wigs!</li>
            <li> its such a wonderful wig the only thing is its soooo long for my height</li>
            <li> It also tangled when I was trying it on a little bit, but I hear a wig brush and a bit of detangler will help with that; I was also kind of struggling with it, because it&#x27;s my first wig ever, so that might explain it.</li>
            <li> While it may take a while to ship if you live in the states , it is definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Looks different from picture not as long as it shows comes to my shoulders but good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Loved the texture of it, came in earlier then expected and works out with what I have, thanks to you!</li>
            <li> Its soft and light weight and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This wig was so realistic looking!</li>
            <li> and it really Curly  and</li>
            <li> I cant complain too much</li>
            <li> The hair looks real and some people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Not trying to fool people that it is real, but some think it is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is very silky feeling and not overly</li>
            <li> And since it came all the way from China, that was fast.</li>
            <li> it tangles to much and to shinning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very manageable, even though it tangles a bit(but</li>
            <li> Maybe another weft would have filled it out enough.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, it was what I expected, good length and curls</li>
            <li> Its also much higher quality and feels more realistic than any other wig</li>
            <li> Very long and tangles easily at the ends.</li>
            <li> Look good in pictures though, so if you only want it to wear for a picture or at a dark movie theater</li>
            <li> this is my first wig, and it actually is not bad at all.the hair comes out if u try to brush it too much,but it looks natural enough to be worn and not look like a wig.</li>
            <li> Because the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is synthetic, it is subject to static electricity, so that wisps of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; cling to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Black Full Wavy Women&#x27;s Wig Long Curly Lady&#x27;s Wigs is cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of big for my head and feels a little uncomfortable but it&#x27;s very pretty and a good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> because looks so natural!!</li>
            <li> This is the second wig I have bought from Taobaopit, and they never fail to please!</li>
            <li> The little trim solved the problem and made the overall look more full and natural.  </li>
            <li> Very silky and soft to touch</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it starts to tangle after a couple of uses, but that happens with most wigs and can be easily fixed with proper care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy a few more in case the one we have gets ratty.</li>
            <li> The wig is certainly similar to the picture and it feels pretty real.</li>
            <li> This wig is every bit as gorgeous as the picture shows, but it is just a teeny bit thin.  </li>
            <li> I live in California, and got it in 19 days.</li>
            <li> I looked a absolute complete mess!:xlol I did not look right with long hair at all.</li>
            <li> I email the seller and told him the problem they said they will send me the right color I&#x27;m still waiting  not to happy at all false headline when order this wig  just to let you know if you want a black wig your not going to get it mine</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Plus it came early !</li>
            <li> I am a regular customer of Amazon, as well as an avid wig wearer.</li>
            <li> It sheds a little, and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t anything a quick finger fluff and bang trim</li>
            <li> It is super soft, and it does tangle slightly, but that is true to any long wig.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The length is perfect: the longest part ends around my bra strap, so a few inches above the small of my back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a large head, but this wig made me feel like I had double the size.  </li>
            <li> It looks really natural, and its not too shiny.  </li>
            <li> I feel like having long pretty hair.</li>
            <li> The wig it self just look to fake and to shining and easy to get tangle quick..</li>
            <li> but looks cute none the less, its comfy and airy so its not too heavy wont sweat too much under it</li>
            <li> Sexy, long enough to have in other style.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad wig, but the part is a little off.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit odd at first when you put them on, but don&#x27;t be discouraged!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my real hair short and punky but I didn&#x27;t want my wedding photos to show short hair..</li>
            <li> It looks very natural on me, and I have naturally blonde hair!</li>
            <li> It does run a little small which means because it is not hookable, more prone to be snatched off!</li>
            <li> Unless your not lazy enough to refix it.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a wig (it is clearly synthetic fiber, not hair) and it tangles quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed and have my hair natural</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, I also sound a white bug, and a few white flakes too</li>
            <li> it seems a little curlier than the pics but seeing as this is my first wig</li>
            <li> That longest section of hair was quite thin and whispy, causing that area to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> And the amount that I could pull it on, it was still too round on top (but that was because it was too small for my head.)</li>
            <li> Took it out package gave it a little shake and it was ready to wear.</li>
            <li> While I was happy with the wig, I was disgusted to find a large white bug embedded in the wig.</li>
            <li> I like the length and the curl, but I&#x27;m gonna have to have one of my friends style it because the part is really hard to get to set right</li>
            <li> Half the wig is smooth, and the other half is knotted up.</li>
            <li> not to long not to short!</li>
            <li> took forever crappy wig wont last long at all doesnt even look like pic</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little bit awkward on my skull, obviously my head is a bit larger than intended for the wig, but it still fits very well, it just doesn&#x27;t look as full as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit long for me.</li>
            <li> and the bangs are a but too long for my face.</li>
            <li> Even after the trim, it is still quite long.</li>
            <li> it is curly and long).</li>
            <li> I order this wig awhile ago  first of all the shipping took a long time and when I got the wig it was the wrong color not black at all  </li>
            <li> Very thin and cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I read from the other review about their being a white bug in their wig, I figured it was probably a one case thing and would give them the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t big enough even when braiding all your hair down for an average size head.  </li>
            <li> but my only issue is that it took a little over a month to arrive because it comes from china and must go through customs I guess.</li>
            <li> It was packed well, in a bag with a little net to keep it from tangling.</li>
            <li> The bangs were a tiny bit long, but I do have a somewhat small face.</li>
            <li> It was packed carefully and even came with a wig cap.  </li>
            <li> ( I use a wide tooth comb) then handle any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> a few wears, the wig has tangled at the bottom and become unwearable,so I&#x27;d recommend it for about one or two time use only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin enough to look natural even if you already have a lot of hair to stuff under it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(this wig would also work for anybody else who has black long hair)</li>
            <li> I brushed it the same day I got it and had most of the hair in my brush, horrible shedding...</li>
            <li> So I was very sad when it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> my other ones came from walmart tho)</li>
            <li> Amazingly real look/feel... a lot of people asked me why I got such a high quality wig just for halloween, but then were shocked when I told them the price!</li>
            <li> Very thin and extremely shiny (not fake looking, but almost greasy looking).</li>
            <li> was a dark brown hope</li>
            <li> very LONG, it goes to about my waist(i&#x27;m rather small though,</li>
            <li> Wig is too long which looks fake, when put on it had small bumps on top that look weird.</li>
            <li> It appeared to be worn previously and tangled.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, I order black and they sent me off black something like a 1b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have on the black shirt</li>
            <li> Not super curly</li>
            <li> This wig was a tangled mess when I got it, and brushing it did not help.</li>
            <li> The wig fits it even has a li&#x27;l band to keep it tight.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not familiar with wigs but from wearing it at work all night I got a lot of complements on it</li>
            <li> Oh I noticed a little shedding</li>
            <li> It tangles and got a little frizzy at the ends</li>
            <li> It does tangle and shed a little.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint about it would be the extreme tangling towards the ends, I did cut off about 3 1/2 to 4 inches</li>
            <li> Cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> I migut cut off a few inches</li>
            <li> but what do yu expect for less than $10 !</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought after the first brushing</li>
            <li> Thin can see the cap holding the hair together if not set perfectly not as long as expected looks to fake if I move the bangs to the side they show the cap.</li>
            <li> Small cap too.</li>
            <li> The wig was too small for my head, it would not fit!</li>
            <li> a bit hard to get on,</li>
            <li> no tangles, no bugs...a little thin</li>
            <li> dont buy not a good deal</li>
            <li> rather buy a wig that won&#x27;t tangle but unfortunately with all the environment and bad smokes such as cigarettes damages the wig.</li>
            <li> but I found the wig to be too thin for my tastes.</li>
            <li> My Sister, didn&#x27;t want to say anything, but I told her that Amazon would stand behind thr products offered.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this product, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It is very thin.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>

            <li> I was very excited when it arrived because it&#x27;s my first wig that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It was packed carefully and even came with a wig cap.  The only problem is that it starts to tangle after a couple of uses, but that happens with most wigs and can be easily fixed with proper care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality for the price. Very thin and extremely shiny (not fake looking, but almost greasy looking). It lost some hair around the part, but otherwise a useable wig for your buck</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful. It looks really natural, and its not too shiny.  This hair is long and you can brush it to give it more volume or if you want to give it a more realistic look. It sheds a little, and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. You can brush or run your fingers through this wig without any problems. For this price, you can give this wig a try because it is a good quality wig.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad but I found the wig to be too thin for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Okay I just received the wig yesterday, and it&#x27;s a very nice one, I&#x27;m not familiar with wigs but from wearing it at work all night I got a lot of complements on it some didn&#x27;t even know it was a wig. My only real complaint about it would be the extreme tangling towards the ends, I did cut off about 3 1/2 to 4 inches cause I thought it was a bit long for me. I&#x27;m mixed and have my hair natural and it really Curly  and about to my shoulders, I got this to wear as a protective style and to play around in mostly for the winter days. I will be purchasing another wig soon. Oh I noticed a little shedding but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought after the first brushing ( I use a wide tooth comb) then handle any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. it does come with a netted wig cap.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, it&#x27;s so soft and silky feeling to the touch.  Sexy, long enough to have in other style.  You will love this wig.</li>
            <li> I order this wig awhile ago  first of all the shipping took a long time and when I got the wig it was the wrong color not black at all  I email the seller and told him the problem they said they will send me the right color I&#x27;m still waiting  not to happy at all false headline when order this wig  just to let you know if you want a black wig your not going to get it mine was a dark brown hope I save you some money not to order this wig</li>
            <li> it seems a little curlier than the pics but seeing as this is my first wig I cant complain too much</li>
            <li> Cheap and worthless. Small cap too.</li>
            <li> I wore this all day at a convention.  It was very comfortable, and it looks very full.  I had someone exclaim that they couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing a wig.  While it did tangle towards the end of the day, it is still in great condition.  I will most definitely buy this brand of wig again.</li>
            <li> I like this wig, I wear it every day but I have to brush it a lot. It tangles and got a little frizzy at the ends so I trimmed it. The hair looks real and some people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig. It&#x27;s kind of big for my head and feels a little uncomfortable but it&#x27;s very pretty and a good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> the wig came quickly and was in perfect condition. It was light to wear and easy to play with and style. It was a bit harsh in the heat, but besides that, this wig is great.</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely stunning!! It arrived well packaged and included a wig cap. Bought it for a Halloween party but might just wear it anytime I feel like having long pretty hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to wear at my wedding. I&#x27;ve cut my real hair short and punky but I didn&#x27;t want my wedding photos to show short hair.. The wig fits it even has a li&#x27;l band to keep it tight. I like the length and the curl, but I&#x27;m gonna have to have one of my friends style it because the part is really hard to get to set right and the bangs are a but too long for my face. But all in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a large head, but this wig made me feel like I had double the size.  It just isn&#x27;t big enough even when braiding all your hair down for an average size head.  I placed it on my niece&#x27;s head and it was perfect.  It is very thin.  i let my niece have it (she&#x27;s 8 by the way) to play around in her costume collection.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is a great wig for the money. I bought it for a friend who is balding and they looked great! Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Loved the texture of it, came in earlier then expected and works out with what I have, thanks to you!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with what I got. Thin can see the cap holding the hair together if not set perfectly not as long as expected looks to fake if I move the bangs to the side they show the cap.</li>
            <li> The wig shedded but still looked good enough to wear will buy again</li>
            <li> Adorable wig, true to color, but came in a tangled mess that took hours to sort out and smooth before the cosplay event.  The curls are a bit tighter than pictured and the bangs are a bit longer as well.  But it wasn&#x27;t anything a quick finger fluff and bang trim didn&#x27;t fix.  I can&#x27;t give it anything more than the 3 stars because it just seems so frizzy when you first get it and did take time to make it look less like a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> the wig is beautiful and very soft and the area where the hair parted had a little skin cap thing on it :D however it had a tiny big of a brown tint to it but it still appeared black so its all good</li>
            <li> felt like cheap wig hair</li>
            <li> I like the wig and it looked very real.  I&#x27;m glad it came with a cap so I could make the wig fit appropriately</li>
            <li> I love tjis wig. I wear it when I&#x27;m having  a bad hair day. And ifbim dressing up. Love it</li>
            <li> use for photo shoots and costumes. Not trying to fool people that it is real, but some think it is. Great quality and style.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, is I did have to trim 3-4 inches off the lenght. That longest section of hair was quite thin and whispy, causing that area to tangle easily. The little trim solved the problem and made the overall look more full and natural.  Even after the trim, it is still quite long. It even comes with a wig cap and adjustable straps for a custom fit. This would be a great product for a first time wig user. I would certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of wigs from cosplay to just trying to find something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking for covering up my rainbow hair, and this one was perfect for hiding my blue hair from my boss! Everyone at work complimented me and I got a couple of phone numbers from customers, too. &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; Very nice, soft, believable wig that contained zero white bugs and wasn&#x27;t overly shiny. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great price, and great look, fun to play with.</li>
            <li> it was not black but it was a nice wig for the price. It does tangle and shed a little. If looking for a cheap nice wig i would suggest this product.</li>
            <li> First of all the wig was delivered superfast....within two days. Took it out package gave it a little shake and it was ready to wear. Its soft and light weight and very natural looking. The ends tangle a bit but that is true of most wigs. I just cut about an inch or so off the ends which made it a bit more managable I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This item was not correct. It appeared to be worn previously and tangled.  My Sister, didn&#x27;t want to say anything, but I told her that Amazon would stand behind thr products offered.  Please contact me as soon as possible.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The curls were more waves than curls, the bangs were much longer than in the picture! It wasn&#x27;t very curly either, just a few waves and didn&#x27;t match well.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Arrived promptly, and appears just like in the picture. Very silky and soft to touch and it is basically all-around excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a &amp;#34;wigstock&amp;#34; outing.  This wig was so realistic looking! Was real happy with the quality for the price!  It came with a hair net and I was able to wear the wig all night without being itchy...real comfortable...even with doing lots of dancing. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> thank you!! is perfect, I just love it! because looks so natural!! not to long not to short! very nice wig!</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and maintainable the length is amazing and the price cant be beat! I got complements all day about how pretty my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; looked and once i said it was a wig the would not believe me! It just looks so real perfect for people who have no hair at all and dont want to spend hundreds on a wig and perfect for people like me who have hair and just flat wanted to be able to change style and color once in a wile without the hassle of dye</li>
            <li> looks synthetic cause it is..... but looks cute none the less, its comfy and airy so its not too heavy wont sweat too much under it</li>
            <li> I read from the other review about their being a white bug in their wig, I figured it was probably a one case thing and would give them the benefit of the doubt. Wrong! As soon as I opened the package, I also sound a white bug, and a few white flakes too, it kinda freaked me out so I just tossed the item, but just make sure to check the wigs prior to putting them on...</li>
            <li> I brushed it the same day I got it and had most of the hair in my brush, horrible shedding...</li>
            <li> its such a wonderful wig the only thing is its soooo long for my height (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3) I migut cut off a few inches otherwise I&#x27;m pretty content with my purchase and would recommend</li>
            <li> took forever crappy wig wont last long at all doesnt even look like pic dont buy not a good deal</li>
            <li> Was happy that it came with a wig cap, but it the condition the wig is in, I will likely not even wear it. This wig was a tangled mess when I got it, and brushing it did not help. Half the wig is smooth, and the other half is knotted up. Brushing  just ripped out hair without helping the big knot. just looks frizzy now.</li>
            <li> Not a bad wig, but the part is a little off. Very long and tangles easily at the ends. The bangs don&#x27;t fall as nicely as I was hoping. For the price though, not terrible.</li>
            <li> Wow! This wig is amazing! It looks and feels real! I love the length as well. Just under my breast and i&#x27;m 5&#x27;9 I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this wig for a costume during the day, and then for fun, since it looked so good, I wore it out for dinner that night!  No one even questioned it!  Guess it didn&#x27;t look that costume-y!</li>
            <li> I got this for spring break week and it held up well and beyond actually. It does run a little small which means because it is not hookable, more prone to be snatched off!..Overall though, it was what I expected, good length and curls</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this is the first wig I have ever owned, so my opinion is not expert.  It looks like the picture in terms of length and wave.  It is obviously a wig (it is clearly synthetic fiber, not hair) and it tangles quite a bit.  This may be the result of my lack of expertise, but the hairs come out/break off when I brush the wig at about the same rate as human hair, except, of course, they are not going to grow back.  Because the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is synthetic, it is subject to static electricity, so that wisps of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; cling to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as part of a vampire costume and it works fine for that purpose.  Good value for a costume wig.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to wear wig with really smooth to touch.  It is great for waering out on an evening date.  I think anyone who gets this wig will be really happy they did.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Looks different from picture not as long as it shows comes to my shoulders but good quality for the price. Overall, great product. Thanx alot</li>
            <li> The wig quality is great and it almost looks real. Its not too shiny and the curls are perfect. I love this wig and highly recomd getting it! Plus it came early !</li>
            <li> no tangles, no bugs...a little thin but what do yu expect for less than $10 ! Very good value :-)</li>
            <li> This wig looks exactly like it does in amazons picture! It&#x27;s thin enough to look natural even if you already have a lot of hair to stuff under it. I bought it for my daughter to do her cosplay but we share it because it&#x27;s stunning! I&#x27;m going to buy a few more in case the one we have gets ratty. Oh, and it even comes with THE BEST wig cap I&#x27;ve ever seen. You can&#x27;t best this for the price but my only issue is that it took a little over a month to arrive because it comes from china and must go through customs I guess. However, I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping and I wasn&#x27;t in a big hurry to get it, so it was ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good wig for an amazing prince!!! a bit hard to get on, but it comes with an amazing hair net!!!! have no idea how to use the hook things, though....</li>
            <li> Well, the wig is very pretty, and for the price... what a steal! It&#x27;s not terribly itchy, especially with a wig cap (a free one came with the wig). It had no odor. It is very silky feeling and not overly shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I might see as problematic are that it comes to about my shoulders... and it&#x27;s a little bit awkward on my skull, obviously my head is a bit larger than intended for the wig, but it still fits very well, it just doesn&#x27;t look as full as it does in the picture. It also tangled when I was trying it on a little bit, but I hear a wig brush and a bit of detangler will help with that; I was also kind of struggling with it, because it&#x27;s my first wig ever, so that might explain it. So, the &amp;#34;faults&amp;#34; are probably my own problem and not faults in the product. :)</li>
            <li> Very thin and cheap looking. Would be nice for costume wear</li>
            <li> It came in only two days and was a WONDERFUL quality. The bangs were a tiny bit long, but I do have a somewhat small face. It was packed well, and even came with a free wig cap! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> this is my first wig, and it actually is not bad at all.the hair comes out if u try to brush it too much,but it looks natural enough to be worn and not look like a wig.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this wig, it was going to be my first wig purchase but I was so disappointed. The wig was too small for my head, it would not fit! And the amount that I could pull it on, it was still too round on top (but that was because it was too small for my head.) So I&#x27;m probably going to give it to someone else. However the seller and the wig itself were very nice. The seller sent the wig in good time. I live in California, and got it in 19 days. And since it came all the way from China, that was fast. The wig itself was beautiful. It was nicely made and looked so great. So I was very sad when it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> i got this for my vriska cosplay and was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;it looks great, rather tangled but when brushed through with a wig brush it was nice and silky soft,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very LONG, it goes to about my waist(i&#x27;m rather small though, about 5&#x27;2\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;very nice wig for the price, came around when it said it would, so i&#x27;m pretty pleased c:&lt;br /&gt;(this wig would also work for anybody else who has black long hair)</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing, and didnt cost much at all. Its also much higher quality and feels more realistic than any other wig i own.(all my other ones came from walmart tho) Right out of the package i was a lil concerned b/c it just looked like a big ball of hair, but it was super easy to brush out and b4 I knew it i was lookin pretty good! I would for sure recommend this wig and WILL be getting more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered a wig before, so I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Judging by the price, I wasn&#x27;t hoping for something too extravagant. It came in the mail very quickly and I am very happy with the quality. It was packed well, in a bag with a little net to keep it from tangling. It even came with a wig cap. The hair is very soft and silky, and flows nicely. It looks very natural on me, and I have naturally blonde hair! I love this wig, and I hope to use it for more occasions in the future!</li>
            <li> The wig is certainly similar to the picture and it feels pretty real. For the price, it does not get any better.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Ok ya&#x27;ll... I was so excited to get my new piece of wig up untill I try it on, child I looked a absolute complete mess!:xlol I did not look right with long hair at all. But thats ok because I only bought it to ware it in a ponytail anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I didn&#x27;t like how the wig looked when I put it in a ponytail but I played around with it and it turn out to be amazing on me.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wig it self just look to fake and to shining and easy to get tangle quick..as soon as you take it out the bag.&lt;br /&gt;3 It has a smell to it too and when I cut it the smell was even worst. (my hair lotion took care of that)&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a nice fullness to it and the BANGS I just LOVE&lt;br /&gt;5. I posted some photos..CHECK IT OUT!! And tell me what you think&lt;br /&gt;6. This wig is for a child like head but some how I mad it work for me lol&lt;br /&gt;7 Not to bad for a 7.99 wig&lt;br /&gt;8. I rate this wig a 3 bcuz it tangles to much and to shinning. Oh yeah, I order black and they sent me off black something like a 1b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have on the black shirt</li>
            <li> Black Full Wavy Women&#x27;s Wig Long Curly Lady&#x27;s Wigs is cute. It&#x27;s easy to set it up. I love it. recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a regular customer of Amazon, as well as an avid wig wearer. This wig was bought just for fun, and at the cheap price I was not expecting much. While I was happy with the wig, I was disgusted to find a large white bug embedded in the wig. Highly unsanitary, and a sure sign of improper storage. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Product is just like the description. Loved it (:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, and it&#x27;s still good!</li>
            <li> It comes with it&#x27;s own wig cap, the hair feels / looks somewhat natural.  Overall a good deal, we would recommend.</li>
            <li> The wig is so nice and soft, it looks real for a wig and has as good as quality as some of the more expensive wigs! It&#x27;s actually very manageable, even though it tangles a bit(but that&#x27;s becuase it is curly and long). It&#x27;s pretty wonderful for the price.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT&lt;br /&gt;After a few wears, the wig has tangled at the bottom and become unwearable,so I&#x27;d recommend it for about one or two time use only.</li>
            <li> This is the second wig I have bought from Taobaopit, and they never fail to please! This wig is a gorgeous black color, and it looks so real! It is super soft, and it does tangle slightly, but that is true to any long wig.&lt;br /&gt;  The length is perfect: the longest part ends around my bra strap, so a few inches above the small of my back. This means it&#x27;s not in the way when I am moving around, and I don&#x27;t feel like all of my movements are going to tangle it.&lt;br /&gt;  The bangs are a bit odd at first when you put them on, but don&#x27;t be discouraged! After playing around with them a bit, I got them how I like them. They are very easy to style and tend to stay where you put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend buying this wig, and any others from Taobaopit. They have very good prices and very good products. While it may take a while to ship if you live in the states , it is definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I was always curious about wigs and after reading some of the reviews on various wigs I decided to try this one since it had good reviews and good price. I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was so cheap and my expectations were met. Wig is too long which looks fake, when put on it had small bumps on top that look weird. Hair gets tangled and falls off.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Look good in pictures though, so if you only want it to wear for a picture or at a dark movie theater then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This wig is every bit as gorgeous as the picture shows, but it is just a teeny bit thin.  Maybe another weft would have filled it out enough.  I had some clip in extensions that I sewed in and it&#x27;s perfect.  Overall, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I wore it about 5 times in different occasions &amp;on the 5th time it got tangle bad!!&lt;br /&gt;So now i&#x27;m in school (i&#x27;m a cosmetologist) fixing it and i hope it&#x27;ll be much better than when i received it&lt;br /&gt;I rather buy a wig that won&#x27;t tangle but unfortunately with all the environment and bad smokes such as cigarettes damages the wig. My advice is don&#x27;t be surrounded by smoke because it would damage the wig &amp; would make the hair tangle. Unless your not lazy enough to refix it. Good luck</li>
            <li> love this, great quality, nobody realized it was a wig when I took it off at dress rehearsal.</li>
            <li> Amazingly real look/feel... a lot of people asked me why I got such a high quality wig just for halloween, but then were shocked when I told them the price!</li>
            <li> Good wig. Very nice hair and great shade of black. Not super curly but It works for me. Came on time.</li>
