    <ol>
            <li>and it was PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it!!!</li>
            <li>the color is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but when drinking any sort of liquid it starts to become &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; on my lips.</li>
            <li>(but on the bright side, this is a very good way to get the product off, when you are done being beautiful for the day)  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Has a good color and the gloss is not watery.</li>
            <li>Without eating or drinking it is amazing though.</li>
            <li>A very refreshing unique color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Colore lasts longer than most, but still unsure if I like this two step method</li>
            <li>I am ordering more as gifts and of course for myself.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>It is ok ,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize this was more of a stain than gloss</li>
            <li>But wears off to easily and dries my lips out.</li>
            <li>I am of Hispanic decent but lighter this time of year sheerly nude is perfect for me</li>
            <li>Refreshing color and serves my purpose natural lip color for long duration fairly!:)</li>
            <li>It does wear out after a while, may b i am yet to find the knack of wearing it right.</li>
            <li>Matches the exact color of my lips, which is a plus..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Dried out lips but love color!</li>
            <li>Color nothing like the picture,  very disappointed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is a pinkish nude -- a bit more pink than I wanted in nude lip color.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love it, but after 4 tries I give it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a lipstick that &amp;#34;rubs&amp;#34; off naturally than one that looks like paint chipping off an old building!</li>
            <li>it really does last ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>This product covers that mismatch quite well, giving a natural and unmade up look.</li>
            <li>Stayed on a long time and gloss doesnt disappear after a few minutes like most glosses do.</li>
            <li>i have been looking for years for a lipcolor that matches my natural lip tone, evens it out, makes sharp lines, and doesnt come off after the first drink of water or kiss on the cheek.  </li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s nothing special</li>

            <li> A bit dry and flaky after awhile</li>
            <li> color really is sheerly nude (speaking from a pale irish heritage perspective)</li>
            <li> The color was darker than pictured and it made my lips very dry and flaked off.  </li>
            <li> Very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously gross to have it turn into little texture balls on my lips.</li>
            <li> The damn lip thingy (it&#x27;s not really lipstick or lipgloss...?) keeps beading up after 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this lip shine, but you have to be careful not to get on your teeth before it drys  </li>
            <li> Color somewhat lighter tan expected.</li>
            <li> I have dark colors lips, which doesn&#x27;t go with my skin color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A bit dry and flaky after awhile</li>
            <li> color really is sheerly nude (speaking from a pale irish heritage perspective) i have been looking for years for a lipcolor that matches my natural lip tone, evens it out, makes sharp lines, and doesnt come off after the first drink of water or kiss on the cheek.  THIS IS IT.  I LOVE this product.  Only con is that it will shed and gum up on you if theres any trace of chapstick on your lips.  (but on the bright side, this is a very good way to get the product off, when you are done being beautiful for the day)  it really does last ALL DAY.  and into the next, regardless of eating, teeth brushing, etc.  I wore this to my wedding and it was PERFECT.  great product.</li>
            <li> Matches the exact color of my lips, which is a plus.. But wears off to easily and dries my lips out.ðŸ˜’</li>
            <li> Color nothing like the picture,  very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Threw it away!</li>
            <li> The color was darker than pictured and it made my lips very dry and flaked off.  I&#x27;d rather have a lipstick that &amp;#34;rubs&amp;#34; off naturally than one that looks like paint chipping off an old building!</li>

            <li> Very dry. Disappointed .</li>
            <li> received this today (monday) and I believe I ordered it Saturday night. the color is gorgeous! I am ordering more as gifts and of course for myself. I am of Hispanic decent but lighter this time of year sheerly nude is perfect for me</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products. Has a good color and the gloss is not watery.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing unique color. I have been wearing it for two days now, i like it. I have dark colors lips, which doesn&#x27;t go with my skin color. This product covers that mismatch quite well, giving a natural and unmade up look. It does wear out after a while, may b i am yet to find the knack of wearing it right. Refreshing color and serves my purpose natural lip color for long duration fairly!:)</li>
            <li> It is ok , I mean it&#x27;s nothing special but the fact that you are paying this price for it , it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but when drinking any sort of liquid it starts to become &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; on my lips. Without eating or drinking it is amazing though.</li>

            <li> Absolutely loved it!!! Stayed on a long time and gloss doesnt disappear after a few minutes like most glosses do.</li>
