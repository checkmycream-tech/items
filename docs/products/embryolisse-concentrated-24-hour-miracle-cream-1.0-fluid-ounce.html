            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I looked elsewhere, but Amazon does seem to have the best price, so I bought it here.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using this under makeup, as I sometimes do, it is best to put it on as soon as you cleanse</li>

            <li>use it and rave on how amazing it is.</li>
            <li>Whilst browsing the internet I came across the picture and immediately remembered the amazing cream he used.</li>
            <li>Feels nice &amp; luxurious.</li>
            <li>It was alright to me, nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I have very strong allergies to face products</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was expecting amazing, life-changing cream after reading about this online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the Best for sensitive skin or allergy types, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The perfect moisturizer to use before applying your makeup or leaving the house bare faced.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but the ingredients scare me a bit</li>
            <li>Amazing keeps my face oil free and my makeup stay all day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it and it works.</li>
            <li>Favorite face cream for the price</li>
            <li>but Amazon is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I use this as a face moisturizer and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer ever especially under makeup!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s already time to reorder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for pre-moisturizing before makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this in the summer</li>
            <li>This may become my favorite cream.</li>
            <li>I learned about this product on Goop and have been using for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use this product, the more even the moisture in my skin becomes.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I know that some people don&#x27;t love the mineral oil aspect, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with that causing break outs for me.</li>
            <li>But you WILL love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>bought it for my sister and well the she love&#x27;s it and is nagging me to buy one more for her :), shipping was great and fast</li>
            <li>I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good !</li>
            <li>I would &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product if the price were a bit lower and the size a bit more generous.</li>
            <li>:) I like the price and container also.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look healthy and hydrated without makeup and under makeup</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lovely and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely very rich...</li>
            <li>Then again, I don&#x27;t use very much at all for my skin to feel good.</li>
            <li>Hydrating and great under makeup as its not thick or greasy.</li>
            <li>and this keep my face perfect all day long!</li>
            <li>It has the perfect balance whether you happen to have oily or dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li>The perfect moisturizer for the dry Colorado weather.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my dry skin in the winter, even a prescription cream, and this is the best thing I have found.</li>
            <li>i love the way it smells and it does make my sking smooth</li>
            <li>An oil free formula would be much better probably.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer for people with dry skin!!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight absorbs into my skin very quickly and gives me all day moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking more for a clean feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything in every price range and this one is the best for the price hands down.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a pomade/creme for my fine, curly, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>and my makeup goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>given how much product you receive, and there&#x27;s nothing too spectacular about the ingredients list,  so</li>
            <li>but despite that this cream works really well on my skin and gives my skin a nice glow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless, rich, and I&#x27;ve found it works great especially under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Its am overall balancing moisturizer without feeling super greasy , but still does a great job moisturizing and leaving my skin a luscious glow.</li>
            <li>The small size is perfect to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find it in many many professional make up artists&#x27; kits.</li>
            <li>Unless you are using it to clean shadow and mascara from your eyes.</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t get a reaction, which is cool.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of noticable fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li>The scent is super flowery but goes away.  </li>
            <li>cream that every girl should have in her medicine cabinet - offers a base for flawless looking and perfectly hydrated skin.  </li>
            <li>Tried it as a night cream but did not see any brightning, pore-shrinking or skin smoothing effects, though I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have pretty good skin, I actually prefer a a heavier cream at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a good cream for DRY skin...</li>
            <li>In spite of Embryolisse&#x27;s light texture, it is emollient rich, and when you first apply it, it will make your skin look and feel very greasy for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this lotion was not anything special.  </li>
            <li>Use it everyday, hydrates, smooths, great under makeup</li>
            <li>Another amazing French product...</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied, but I haven&#x27;t seen a miracle so far...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price</li>
            <li>Readily absorbed, so not greasy or slippery.</li>
            <li>...worth the money and worth the time to order it...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this cream was worth it for the money.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but once applied the scent disappears and leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d wake up with moisturized, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and since my skin is somewhat sensitive and acne-prone, most haven&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite mositurizers.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel SO soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves a pretty finish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as my nighttime moisturizer since it is sunscreen free.  </li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer but my skin is a little oily in some parts.</li>
            <li>absolutely works!</li>
            <li>I actually first tried this after hearing beauty bloggers rave about it in a birchbox.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try this facial moisturizer for years when i saw many youtuber beauty gurus, celebrity makeup artists etc.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream!</li>
            <li>I was first put off by the smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like my Cetaphil better.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a really good moisturizer, but too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not particularly thick, but it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li>Packaging very useful and friendly (easy to carry around).&lt;br /&gt;Could be a little more nourishing for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>As an esthetician I am always on the hunt for a good day/night cream that is rich but not oily and let me tell you this is a hard combination to come by!  </li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive compared to higher end moisturizers and works just as well.</li>
            <li>I have severly dry skin and use this in the summer with a moisturizing mineral sunscreen on top.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich cream and I use it on dry areas of face and body.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the price point.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it,</li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with this product so that is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The texture is very pleasing to the touch.</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone /combination skin.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this cream in my Birchbox subscription and didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>If you have combo or oily skin then use this very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without the heavy/oily feeling and it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well for under makeup</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I use</li>
            <li>oh and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>The one thing I will say to people who are used to using alcohol-rich moisturizers that give the illusion of \\&quot;sinking in\\&quot; (which in itself is a myth, no product can penetrate more than the top few layers of the skin), this product is quite different than what you will expect.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I really like ti</li>
            <li>Even after washing my face at night I can really feel the difference since I&#x27;m using this cream.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy, and works very well under makeup.</li>
            <li>This product is not greasy, performs very well all thruout the day.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my face better than any other product.</li>
            <li>I figured if I wore it at night it might soak into the skin better (like some other products I&#x27;ve used)</li>
            <li>Works better than other products.</li>
            <li>sinks in very quickly and leaves a matte to semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li>Decent price for the product</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s lilac in particular</li>
            <li>Last year I made a resolution to take batter care of my skin...and no one has better skin than the French and the Koreans, so I made a mass purchase of a bunch of things.</li>
            <li>This is a super basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich mositurizer with a slight lily of the valley scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the momentary greasiness (which is due to the product doing its job) goes away pretty quickly, and for me it never reappears during the day.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, although, it could come in a bigger tube...</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how my skin felt with this.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong (at least stronger than I prefer) floral smell...</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using a super hydrating cream and it made my face really oily for the climate I am in</li>
            <li>if you have dry skin it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, doesn&#x27;t make my skin shinny and penetrates very quickly (which is convenient to put make up on after).</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance, almost too faint.</li>
            <li>I will purchase a large one next order!</li>
            <li>It has a mousse-like consistancy and a light scent that disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>but this finally fixed that</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin like seriously sensitive.</li>
            <li>I can say though that the Embryolisse 24 Hour Miracle Cream fits both these criteria&#x27;s very well especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I have true combo skin, with an oily forehead and occasional dry patches on my skin, so I need something that&#x27;s lightweight but still moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for daytime wear for oily skinned folks, but if you have dry skin, seasonally reactive skin, or true combo skin, then definitely check this product out.</li>
            <li>But this is a decent moisturizer overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I would use this in the summer because I do prefer an SPF, but for the winter when one really needs serious moisture or for night time it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>It helps it calm down without excessively weighing it down, and gives a gorgeous soft shine -- almost like 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly, does not feel thick or sticky and wears well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers, for sensitive, thin skin</li>
            <li>and then wait a few minutes before applying other products on top.</li>
            <li>I am a 51 year old female from ME.</li>
            <li>Any time I have a breakout I use a little extra on the spot during the day and it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tempted to try other products within there range now.</li>
            <li>It has a really light scent that I love, slightly floral and very expensive smelling.</li>
            <li>I  have dry skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li>You just need a few minutes to let it dry on the skin, get absorbed and the shine will go away.</li>
            <li>It was fine, but no better than other domestic products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I have to use some pretty harsh prescription medications on my face and this is the only cream I have found that not only keeps my face from peeling, it makes it &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Now that is has cooled off I have problems with my face drying out during the daytime not only would my face peel</li>

            <li> Whilst browsing the internet I came across the picture and immediately remembered the amazing cream he used.</li>
            <li> Feels nice &amp; luxurious.</li>
            <li> It was alright to me, nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> I have very strong allergies to face products</li>
            <li> I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was expecting amazing, life-changing cream after reading about this online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Best for sensitive skin or allergy types, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The perfect moisturizer to use before applying your makeup or leaving the house bare faced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the ingredients scare me a bit</li>
            <li> Amazing keeps my face oil free and my makeup stay all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it and it works.</li>
            <li> Favorite face cream for the price</li>
            <li> but Amazon is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face moisturizer and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever especially under makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s already time to reorder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for pre-moisturizing before makeup as well.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this in the summer</li>
            <li> This may become my favorite cream.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product on Goop and have been using for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use this product, the more even the moisture in my skin becomes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I know that some people don&#x27;t love the mineral oil aspect, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with that causing break outs for me.</li>
            <li> But you WILL love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> bought it for my sister and well the she love&#x27;s it and is nagging me to buy one more for her :), shipping was great and fast</li>
            <li> I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good !</li>
            <li> I would &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product if the price were a bit lower and the size a bit more generous.</li>
            <li> :) I like the price and container also.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look healthy and hydrated without makeup and under makeup</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lovely and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely very rich...</li>
            <li> Then again, I don&#x27;t use very much at all for my skin to feel good.</li>
            <li> Hydrating and great under makeup as its not thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> and this keep my face perfect all day long!</li>
            <li> It has the perfect balance whether you happen to have oily or dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> The perfect moisturizer for the dry Colorado weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dry skin in the winter, even a prescription cream, and this is the best thing I have found.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells and it does make my sking smooth</li>
            <li> An oil free formula would be much better probably.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for people with dry skin!!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight absorbs into my skin very quickly and gives me all day moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking more for a clean feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in every price range and this one is the best for the price hands down.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a pomade/creme for my fine, curly, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and my makeup goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> given how much product you receive, and there&#x27;s nothing too spectacular about the ingredients list,  so</li>
            <li> but despite that this cream works really well on my skin and gives my skin a nice glow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless, rich, and I&#x27;ve found it works great especially under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Its am overall balancing moisturizer without feeling super greasy , but still does a great job moisturizing and leaving my skin a luscious glow.</li>
            <li> The small size is perfect to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find it in many many professional make up artists&#x27; kits.</li>
            <li> Unless you are using it to clean shadow and mascara from your eyes.</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t get a reaction, which is cool.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of noticable fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li> The scent is super flowery but goes away.  </li>
            <li> cream that every girl should have in her medicine cabinet - offers a base for flawless looking and perfectly hydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> Tried it as a night cream but did not see any brightning, pore-shrinking or skin smoothing effects, though I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have pretty good skin, I actually prefer a a heavier cream at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a good cream for DRY skin...</li>
            <li> In spite of Embryolisse&#x27;s light texture, it is emollient rich, and when you first apply it, it will make your skin look and feel very greasy for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this lotion was not anything special.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday, hydrates, smooths, great under makeup</li>
            <li> Another amazing French product...</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied, but I haven&#x27;t seen a miracle so far...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price</li>
            <li> Readily absorbed, so not greasy or slippery.</li>
            <li> ...worth the money and worth the time to order it...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this cream was worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but once applied the scent disappears and leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d wake up with moisturized, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and since my skin is somewhat sensitive and acne-prone, most haven&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite mositurizers.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel SO soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves a pretty finish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as my nighttime moisturizer since it is sunscreen free.  </li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer but my skin is a little oily in some parts.</li>
            <li> absolutely works!</li>
            <li> I actually first tried this after hearing beauty bloggers rave about it in a birchbox.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this facial moisturizer for years when i saw many youtuber beauty gurus, celebrity makeup artists etc.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream!</li>
            <li> I was first put off by the smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like my Cetaphil better.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a really good moisturizer, but too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly thick, but it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li> Packaging very useful and friendly (easy to carry around).&lt;br /&gt;Could be a little more nourishing for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As an esthetician I am always on the hunt for a good day/night cream that is rich but not oily and let me tell you this is a hard combination to come by!  </li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive compared to higher end moisturizers and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have severly dry skin and use this in the summer with a moisturizing mineral sunscreen on top.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream and I use it on dry areas of face and body.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the price point.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it,</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with this product so that is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The texture is very pleasing to the touch.</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone /combination skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream in my Birchbox subscription and didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it really does what it says.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> If you have combo or oily skin then use this very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without the heavy/oily feeling and it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well for under makeup</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I use</li>
            <li> oh and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say to people who are used to using alcohol-rich moisturizers that give the illusion of \\&quot;sinking in\\&quot; (which in itself is a myth, no product can penetrate more than the top few layers of the skin), this product is quite different than what you will expect.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I really like ti</li>
            <li> Even after washing my face at night I can really feel the difference since I&#x27;m using this cream.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy, and works very well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy, performs very well all thruout the day.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my face better than any other product.</li>
            <li> I figured if I wore it at night it might soak into the skin better (like some other products I&#x27;ve used)</li>
            <li> Works better than other products.</li>
            <li> sinks in very quickly and leaves a matte to semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li> Decent price for the product</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s lilac in particular</li>
            <li> Last year I made a resolution to take batter care of my skin...and no one has better skin than the French and the Koreans, so I made a mass purchase of a bunch of things.</li>
            <li> This is a super basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich mositurizer with a slight lily of the valley scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the momentary greasiness (which is due to the product doing its job) goes away pretty quickly, and for me it never reappears during the day.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, although, it could come in a bigger tube...</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how my skin felt with this.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong (at least stronger than I prefer) floral smell...</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using a super hydrating cream and it made my face really oily for the climate I am in</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, doesn&#x27;t make my skin shinny and penetrates very quickly (which is convenient to put make up on after).</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, almost too faint.</li>
            <li> I will purchase a large one next order!</li>
            <li> It has a mousse-like consistancy and a light scent that disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> but this finally fixed that</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin like seriously sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can say though that the Embryolisse 24 Hour Miracle Cream fits both these criteria&#x27;s very well especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I have true combo skin, with an oily forehead and occasional dry patches on my skin, so I need something that&#x27;s lightweight but still moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for daytime wear for oily skinned folks, but if you have dry skin, seasonally reactive skin, or true combo skin, then definitely check this product out.</li>
            <li> But this is a decent moisturizer overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I would use this in the summer because I do prefer an SPF, but for the winter when one really needs serious moisture or for night time it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> It helps it calm down without excessively weighing it down, and gives a gorgeous soft shine -- almost like 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, does not feel thick or sticky and wears well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers, for sensitive, thin skin</li>
            <li> and then wait a few minutes before applying other products on top.</li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old female from ME.</li>
            <li> Any time I have a breakout I use a little extra on the spot during the day and it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tempted to try other products within there range now.</li>
            <li> It has a really light scent that I love, slightly floral and very expensive smelling.</li>
            <li> I  have dry skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li> You just need a few minutes to let it dry on the skin, get absorbed and the shine will go away.</li>
            <li> It was fine, but no better than other domestic products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I have to use some pretty harsh prescription medications on my face and this is the only cream I have found that not only keeps my face from peeling, it makes it &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Now that is has cooled off I have problems with my face drying out during the daytime not only would my face peel</li>
            <li> a little really goes a long way and so for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for sheering out your wax or heavy cream based foundation but USE VERY LITTLE.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this got so much hype.</li>
            <li> The only possible ingredient that could break someone out is the Steareth-10, however, it&#x27;s quite low on the list, which means there&#x27;s not much in there.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and have tried a million different lotions and potions to help.</li>
            <li> Embryolisse actually seems to work well on both my oily patches and my dry spots, and even after a month I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or reactionary breakouts.</li>
            <li> A great find for someone like me with aging skin living in a seasonally brutal area of the USA.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin but am prone to a few dry patches here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say it has standard, old fashioned, ingredients and that just because it&#x27;s French, doesn&#x27;t mean anything.</li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive products with less favorable results.</li>
            <li> Mixed with all my other products this finishes everything off.</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, I don&#x27;t have any dry, crepey skin or wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It helped with dry skin but not a miracle worker as I was led to believe</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker for Dry skin types.</li>
            <li> However I do use this on clients that have dry skin</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a life saver when my skin is dry in the fall &amp; winter.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronically dry skin and this keeps my face supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and I like keeping a tube in my makeup bag for when I feel dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel thick like a normal night cream but don&#x27;t let it fool you.</li>
            <li> a total primer, fixes dry spots and a little goes a long way...for those who don&#x27;t check &amp;#34;oz&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li> Looks like the tube will last quite a while, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> although like I said, I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and won&#x27;t even bother with any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I saw it in a youtuber&#x27;s &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; video and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like a heavy moisturizer at night and decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> One thing I do find this too heavy for is double cleansing...</li>
            <li> I hate any fragranced product for my skin, so I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not a greasy formula so a little goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t make me oily.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I saw a rave review about this product in Vogue the other day and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> For this small thing so I suggest you guys buy a bigger size</li>
            <li> This one is about average from my experience.</li>
            <li> but for the price, it&#x27;s just not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to at least try for yourself.  </li>
            <li> It is like any other cream, I don&#x27;t see any miracle !  </li>
            <li> It felt slightly greasy/oily/sticky.</li>
            <li> After using this moisturizer for about a month my skin started to break out like crazy (I generally don&#x27;t have a lot of acne just an occasional pimple)!</li>
            <li> I use it year round without any oily problems in summer.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker, heavy duty cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, after hearing a lot of hype about it on the internet for some time.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had an issue with this being too heavy for summer use,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to similar, less expensive, drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> The tube is small but it takes very little for coverage.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if I will reorder.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this I was disappointed because it was so small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Embryolisse Lait Creme Concentrate moisturizer on an off for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> a small tube but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find any product (washes, lotions, makeup...</li>
            <li> and there especially when the weather gets cold.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too thick for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Though it is a very small amount, but helps.</li>
            <li> If it were less expensive I might give it another purchase....</li>
            <li> but it would get very dull.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly on my face because I will get the odd breakout if I go crazy with it.</li>
            <li> No more dryness on my face in the winter months!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> Have been using the cream for over a month and have seen dramatic decrease in dryness.</li>
            <li> Also the tube is annoying, and doesn&#x27;t let you get all of the cream out -- which is frustrating when it&#x27;s so expensive for so little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> It does not make my face breakout which I am prone to if I use the wrong stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst facial moisturizer, it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product - it&#x27;s just not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> There is a very faint floral scent, but I find it to be quite pleasing.</li>
            <li> but after three - four days i broke out badly.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of it&#x27;s reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Your face Will get dewey to oily faster with this as a base.  </li>
            <li> and this made me break out very badly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin.  Smells like a grandma.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this lotion was not anything special.  However, wearing it under my makeup is wonderful.  I use a water based primer + water based foundation, and this lotion works beautifully.  It&#x27;s not particularly thick, but it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face shiny.  I also really like the price point.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic moisturizer. I have severly dry skin and use this in the summer with a moisturizing mineral sunscreen on top. It has a mousse-like consistancy and a light scent that disappears after a few minutes. Absorbs very quickly, does not feel thick or sticky and wears well under makeup. Tried it as a night cream but did not see any brightning, pore-shrinking or skin smoothing effects, though I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have pretty good skin, I actually prefer a a heavier cream at night. I also have very sensitive skin and this had no adverse effects like redness, itchiness or breakouts. Plan to repurchase when it gets warmer.</li>
            <li> cream that every girl should have in her medicine cabinet - offers a base for flawless looking and perfectly hydrated skin.  no frills, non-greasy formula is great for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was expecting amazing, life-changing cream after reading about this online. It&#x27;s a really good cream and I really like it, but it wasn&#x27;t life changing. It has a really light scent that I love, slightly floral and very expensive smelling. It goes on like a dream, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin adjustment period. So you know, it&#x27;s a great cream. It&#x27;s just not the best cream ever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this product. It is lightweight absorbs into my skin very quickly and gives me all day moisture to my skin. I am so glad I tried this product. It is very inexpensive compared to higher end moisturizers and works just as well. I use this for both personal use and in my makeup freelance kit.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the ingredients scare me a bit so I am not sure if I will reorder.  I do have to stay this absolutely works! I use this in morning before I put on my makeup and it makes my skin feel AMAZING and my makeup goes on smooth.  I have really sensitive and acne prone skin.  I have not had any issues with this product so that is a real plus.  The only drawback for me is the parabens.</li>
            <li> Saw this cream reviewed on a makeup guru&#x27;s video blog, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It arrived quickly, and didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s odorless, rich, and I&#x27;ve found it works great especially under the eyes.  It absorbs fairly quickly and isn&#x27;t tacky or greasy. Looks like the tube will last quite a while, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer and I lovvve the smell!!</li>
            <li> This is a cult favorite for a reason! Feels nice &amp; luxurious. Only wish it had spf</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Good for dry skin and sensitive skin. The texture is very pleasing to the touch. Pleasant fragrance, almost too faint.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells and it does make my sking smooth but after three - four days i broke out badly. it was probably all of the parabens in it. i had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing keeps my face oil free and my makeup stay all day</li>
            <li> Decent price for the product and now I am HOOKED! I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here. I cannot imagine going back to oil of olay after now using this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this moisurizer! No more dryness on my face in the winter months!!</li>
            <li> I saw a rave review about this product in Vogue the other day and decided to give it a try. I have really dry skin and have tried a million different lotions and potions to help. This one is about average from my experience. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great. If it were less expensive I might give it another purchase....but for the price, it&#x27;s just not worth it for me. I&#x27;ll stick to similar, less expensive, drugstore brands. Not sure why this got so much hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the cream every now and then and I&#x27;m satisfied, but I haven&#x27;t seen a miracle so far...In the end, it is only a moisturizer...</li>
            <li> I have to use some pretty harsh prescription medications on my face and this is the only cream I have found that not only keeps my face from peeling, it makes it &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Now that is has cooled off I have problems with my face drying out during the daytime not only would my face peel but it would get very dull. I actually first tried this after hearing beauty bloggers rave about it in a birchbox. Since I have started using it for only a week my face has a glow, my skin is plumper, and it is moisturized without being greasy. Embyolisse also does not break me out and makeup goes on over it like a DREAM. I cannot recommend this enough in the winter</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this facial moisturizer for years when i saw many youtuber beauty gurus, celebrity makeup artists etc. use it and rave on how amazing it is. My skin is very acne prone /combination skin. It has the perfect balance whether you happen to have oily or dry flaky skin. Its am overall balancing moisturizer without feeling super greasy , but still does a great job moisturizing and leaving my skin a luscious glow.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream in my Birchbox subscription and didn&#x27;t really think anything of it. A few weeks later I saw it in a youtuber&#x27;s &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; video and decided to give it a try. I really like this face cream! Previously I had been using a super hydrating cream and it made my face really oily for the climate I am in but this finally fixed that and my face feels good again.</li>
            <li> Very good cream and I don&#x27;t feel my face oil. Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this around my eyes since it is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes get puffy. As a bonus, I don&#x27;t have any dry, crepey skin or wrinkles around my eyes. win win for me.</li>
            <li> It is like any other cream, I don&#x27;t see any miracle !  I use it on my 12-year-old daughter, who has fair baby skin to start with.  But don&#x27;t see any difference !</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say it has standard, old fashioned, ingredients and that just because it&#x27;s French, doesn&#x27;t mean anything. All I can say is blah blah blah. I love it and it works. It moisturizes my face better than any other product. A great find for someone like me with aging skin living in a seasonally brutal area of the USA. I am a 51 year old female from ME. I hope my review helps others in some way. I have used much more expensive products with less favorable results.</li>
            <li> Favorite face cream for the price</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and won&#x27;t even bother with any other moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried everything in every price range and this one is the best for the price hands down.  You&#x27;ll find it in many many professional make up artists&#x27; kits. It&#x27;s an industry standard.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product! But I used for a month, and it causes acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy, it just moisturizes the face.  I have very strong allergies to face products and this didn&#x27;t get a reaction, which is cool.  It&#x27;s also not a greasy formula so a little goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t make me oily.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would use this in the summer because I do prefer an SPF, but for the winter when one really needs serious moisture or for night time it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> I  have dry skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  I wanted to check this out for awhile because I read great reviews on it.  I like the product, though it&#x27;s not a miracle in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This contains paraffin, which is an occlusive moisturizer- this means it will help prevent TEWL ( trans epidermal moisture loss) aka create a barrier on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sinks in very quickly and leaves a matte to semi-matte finish. If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feel of some moisturizers, you&#x27;d probably like this.  The only possible ingredient that could break someone out is the Steareth-10, however, it&#x27;s quite low on the list, which means there&#x27;s not much in there.  This product does list fragrance in the ingredients list, however, I don&#x27;t find it has a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price given how much product you receive, and there&#x27;s nothing too spectacular about the ingredients list,  so I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing.  But this is a decent moisturizer overall.</li>
            <li> I wish we could get Embryolisse in the states but Amazon is the next best thing. I use this as a face moisturizer and my skin has never looked better. Mixed with all my other products this finishes everything off. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy, it soaks right in. The perfect moisturizer for the dry Colorado weather.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, will keep this in my beauty regimen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed. I have dry skin. It is a gentle moisturizer. Even my daughter with oily skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers, for sensitive, thin skin and this is the only one that works. Readily absorbed, so not greasy or slippery. Facilitates application of make up because skin is so supple. I use it year round without any oily problems in summer. A must have!!!!</li>
            <li> A big hit when I gave it for a gift.</li>
            <li> Great product and it really does what it says.  I am happy I ordered it and will re-order soon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a night cream. It doesn&#x27;t feel thick like a normal night cream but don&#x27;t let it fool you. It does the job. Any time I have a breakout I use a little extra on the spot during the day and it clears up quickly. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of noticable fragrance.</li>
            <li> The perfect moisturizer to use before applying your makeup or leaving the house bare faced. I prefer something thicker at night but for daytime wear I wouldn&#x27;t want anything else.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.  A little goes a long way.  It helped with dry skin but not a miracle worker as I was led to believe</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever especially under makeup! I have very dry skin and this keep my face perfect all day long!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s already time to reorder.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, hydrates, smooths, great under makeup</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot.  I use it mainly as my nighttime moisturizer since it is sunscreen free.  It does not make my face breakout which I am prone to if I use the wrong stuff.  I would definitely recommend to at least try for yourself.  It is very lightweight.  A+++++</li>
            <li> Another amazing French product...a total primer, fixes dry spots and a little goes a long way...for those who don&#x27;t check &amp;#34;oz&amp;#34; or size it is a smaller tube...worth the money and worth the time to order it...great primer for before makeup too I mixed it with my BB cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for sheering out your wax or heavy cream based foundation but USE VERY LITTLE.  It&#x27;s ok for pre-moisturizing before makeup as well.  If you have combo or oily skin then use this very sparingly.  Your face Will get dewey to oily faster with this as a base.  This is a miracle worker for Dry skin types. The scent is super flowery but goes away.  It&#x27;s not the Best for sensitive skin or allergy types, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this cream was worth it for the money. It was fine, but no better than other domestic products I&#x27;ve purchased. Also the tube is annoying, and doesn&#x27;t let you get all of the cream out -- which is frustrating when it&#x27;s so expensive for so little.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dry skin in the winter, even a prescription cream, and this is the best thing I have found. It is a thicker, heavy duty cream and I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it to anyone with oily skin, but if you have dry skin it is definitely worth it. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but once applied the scent disappears and leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy all day.</li>
            <li> The best face cream I have ever found!!! I will continue to use it and have already purchased 2 more!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I mix mine with Tinted moisturizer and it goes on beautifully, leaving my face feeling healthy and hydrated. The tube is small but it takes very little for coverage. This is going to be a staple in my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face cream!! It&#x27;s so light, non greasy!! Great for any skin type!  I love this stuff! I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! I was introduced to the product through an online business called Birchbox. I had received a sample of it and got through about a week and a half&#x27;s use - a decent amount of time for me to see any sort of reaction: breakouts, rashes, etc. I have very thin and sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard for me to find any product (washes, lotions, makeup... you name it) that I&#x27;m not allergic to. I was very surprised at how my skin felt with this. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without the heavy/oily feeling and it absorbs very well. Then again, I don&#x27;t use very much at all for my skin to feel good. It works very well for under makeup (I use mineral makeup if that makes a difference). No worries about future oily face throughout the day! Yay! I find it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, although, it could come in a bigger tube...</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. It has a neutral smell and is not greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves a pretty finish. What makes this product so valuable to me is its versatility. I also use it as a pomade/creme for my fine, curly, damaged hair. It helps it calm down without excessively weighing it down, and gives a gorgeous soft shine -- almost like 2nd day hair. LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> Hydrating and great under makeup as its not thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> It was alright to me, nothing spectacular.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I try everything I didn&#x27;t personally care for it for myself, I have oily skin and I felt this moisturizer just sat on my face and it felt gross.However I do use this on clients that have dry skin</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product - it&#x27;s just not for me unfortunately. I have normal to oily skin but am prone to a few dry patches here and there especially when the weather gets cold. I bought this because I like a heavy moisturizer at night and decided to try something different. I was first put off by the smell. It has a pretty strong (at least stronger than I prefer) floral smell...I think it&#x27;s lilac in particular but I can&#x27;t be sure. I hate any fragranced product for my skin, so I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about that. It&#x27;s definitely very rich...I just don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into the skin very well. No matter how much I use I always feel like there is a film sitting atop my skin when I put this on. I figured if I wore it at night it might soak into the skin better (like some other products I&#x27;ve used) and I&#x27;d wake up with moisturized, fresh skin. However, I&#x27;d wake up still feeling like there was a film over my skin and I didn&#x27;t feel anymore moisturized than if I used a cheaper product. Overall, I like my Cetaphil better. I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich mositurizer with a slight lily of the valley scent. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this in the summer but it&#x27;s a life saver when my skin is dry in the fall &amp; winter. It&#x27;s beautiful under makeup. The small size is perfect to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for people with dry skin!! It keeps your skin moisturized for the entire day. I will definitely be restocking up on this item.</li>
            <li> This may become my favorite cream. You just need a few minutes to let it dry on the skin, get absorbed and the shine will go away. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> When I first received this I was disappointed because it was so small and it cost me 14 dollars 14!!! For this small thing so I suggest you guys buy a bigger size but despite that this cream works really well on my skin and gives my skin a nice glow and I will be buying a bigger size soon oh and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I learned about this product on Goop and have been using for more than a year. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that I use for many things.; make up primer, removal of makeup and mixed with my foundation. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being oily, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance free  cream ever! Works better than other products. I would purchase this product again and recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin in every way. I have sensitive skin like seriously sensitive.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I will purchase a large one next order!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a good cream for DRY skin... If you have oily skin run from it. Unless you are using it to clean shadow and mascara from your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, after hearing a lot of hype about it on the internet for some time. I looked elsewhere, but Amazon does seem to have the best price, so I bought it here. I have true combo skin, with an oily forehead and occasional dry patches on my skin, so I need something that&#x27;s lightweight but still moisturizing. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and since my skin is somewhat sensitive and acne-prone, most haven&#x27;t worked for me. Embryolisse actually seems to work well on both my oily patches and my dry spots, and even after a month I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or reactionary breakouts. There is a very faint floral scent, but I find it to be quite pleasing. I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use this product, the more even the moisture in my skin becomes. The one thing I will say to people who are used to using alcohol-rich moisturizers that give the illusion of \\&quot;sinking in\\&quot; (which in itself is a myth, no product can penetrate more than the top few layers of the skin), this product is quite different than what you will expect. In spite of Embryolisse&#x27;s light texture, it is emollient rich, and when you first apply it, it will make your skin look and feel very greasy for about 3-5 minutes. If you plan on using this under makeup, as I sometimes do, it is best to put it on as soon as you cleanse and then wait a few minutes before applying other products on top. I&#x27;ve noticed that the momentary greasiness (which is due to the product doing its job) goes away pretty quickly, and for me it never reappears during the day. I would not recommend this for daytime wear for oily skinned folks, but if you have dry skin, seasonally reactive skin, or true combo skin, then definitely check this product out.</li>
            <li> Though it is a very small amount, but helps.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Last year I made a resolution to take batter care of my skin...and no one has better skin than the French and the Koreans, so I made a mass purchase of a bunch of things. This is by far one of my favorite mositurizers. I suffer from chronically dry skin and this keeps my face supple and hydrated. I know that some people don&#x27;t love the mineral oil aspect, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with that causing break outs for me. I also haven&#x27;t had an issue with this being too heavy for summer use, although like I said, I have very dry skin. One thing I do find this too heavy for is double cleansing...I just prefer something lighter for my intial cleansing step. Overall, this is one of my holy grail products and I find myself purachsong it again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream and I use it on dry areas of face and body.  I use it sparingly on my face because I will get the odd breakout if I go crazy with it.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer but my skin is a little oily in some parts. I had a breakout with this product. I&#x27;m not using it everyday.</li>
            <li> My makeup artist used this cream on my face when I was modeling overseas in 2010. Whilst browsing the internet I came across the picture and immediately remembered the amazing cream he used. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!!! the best, silkiest, non greasy lotion. It makes my skin feel amazing and is great for under makeup and stuff. BUY THIS STUFF and if you don&#x27;t like it...I&#x27;ll take it...haha. But you WILL love it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin and this made me break out very badly. I think it&#x27;s too thick for my skin type. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> bought it for my sister and well the she love&#x27;s it and is nagging me to buy one more for her :), shipping was great and fast</li>
            <li> I really like ti, it&#x27;s Very good for my oily skin. I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good !</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and tend to be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; in the non-T zone sections. Have been using the cream for over a month and have seen dramatic decrease in dryness. I would &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product if the price were a bit lower and the size a bit more generous.</li>
            <li> Update: After using this moisturizer for about a month my skin started to break out like crazy (I generally don&#x27;t have a lot of acne just an occasional pimple)! I guess it&#x27;s a really good moisturizer, but too heavy for my skin. An oil free formula would be much better probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and I&#x27;m using this cream before applying my bb cream or foundation. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, doesn&#x27;t make my skin shinny and penetrates very quickly (which is convenient to put make up on after). It makes my skin feel SO soft and smooth! Even after washing my face at night I can really feel the difference since I&#x27;m using this cream. I love it !</li>
            <li> I used it but was not at all impressed.  I think I ended up throwing it away with only 1/2 used.</li>
            <li> This is a super basic moisturizer. It has nothing in it that will improve the texture of your skin overtime, all it does it keep skin hydrated. I&#x27;ve been buying Embryolisse Lait Creme Concentrate moisturizer on an off for the past 5 years. I have dry skin and I like keeping a tube in my makeup bag for when I feel dry throughout the day. It keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy, and works very well under makeup. I always use it when I&#x27;m wearing matte foundation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price to me. It felt slightly greasy/oily/sticky. I&#x27;m looking more for a clean feel. I used this under my makeup, and/or to swab off eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase again. It&#x27;s not the worst facial moisturizer, it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> My daugther told me about Embryolisse cream so I gave it a try I will be reordering this face cream because it feels great and it does not make me break out :) I like the price and container also.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of it&#x27;s reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed with it. I do have dry skin though. It doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin or moisturizer it well at all.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I am always on the hunt for a good day/night cream that is rich but not oily and let me tell you this is a hard combination to come by!  I can say though that the Embryolisse 24 Hour Miracle Cream fits both these criteria&#x27;s very well especially during the winter months.  It makes my skin look healthy and hydrated without makeup and under makeup my skin has a dewy complexion without looking oily or like I&#x27;m sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a small tube but a little really goes a long way and so for the price I think this was a great purchase.  I&#x27;m very tempted to try other products within there range now.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy, performs very well all thruout the day.  Packaging very useful and friendly (easy to carry around).&lt;br /&gt;Could be a little more nourishing for my very dry skin.  Overall it&#x27;s lovely and I would purchase again.</li>
