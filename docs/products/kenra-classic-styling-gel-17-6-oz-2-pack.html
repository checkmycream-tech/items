            <li> I have medium length, mostly gray/white hair with some natural wave.  My hairdresser was using this on  my hair and recommended I get it.  She told me what she paid as a hairdresser at the beauty supply.  I check Amazon.com first for just about everything and you beat the price by several dollars.  It was on the front porch before time to wash my hair again.  I love the gel.  My hair holds the style so I need less spray.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> holds strongly but dries sticky</li>
            <li> This is a great gel for adding body to thin, lifeless hair.  Loved the ease of ordering rather than running all over looking for it.  Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I started using Kenra on a fluke when my mom gave me some to try.  I love it.  It has great hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky.  I especially love that this product is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and wear it short.  This controls the hair, gives it volume and on day 2 (If I don&#x27;t wash my hair)---it is still working!!!</li>
            <li> great product for short hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I am very sensitive to fragrances and have no problem with this product. It also gives a nice clean hold.</li>

            <li> These are a traveller&#x27;s dream.  Packs easily into a cosmetic bag and does not take up much room.  Love the product and was delighted to see it in small sizes!  Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I have short hair, lots of it, but the strands are fine. This gives me great body with no weight. I can curl it, style it, and the hold is great. It&#x27;s not sticky and heavy. It does feel heavy going on, but blow dries beautifully. Love it!</li>
            <li> No other gel gives me this much body!</li>
            <li> Many years ago my hairdresser used Kenra on my hair.  I was hooked.  I moved many states away from home this year and didn&#x27;t know how to obtain this product.  Voila!  Amazon.com came to my rescue.  I searched and found Kenra and ordered a 2 pack.  This gel is great.  And so is Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I can use! Doesnt dry my hair and its not greasy, I&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds and THIS is the one</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not real sticky. If you have oily fine hair do not use too much, because it can make your hair more oily.</li>
