            <li>Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>so glad I did!</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it to be mentioned on the box.</li>
            <li>Kind of like it.</li>
            <li>I am optimistic about using one more bottle to get rid of the fungus on both toes and get rid of it for good.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you if this is effective or not.</li>
            <li>This item worked quickly on clearing up the fungal infection on my great toe.</li>
            <li>my husband says that this clear nail worked wonderful</li>
            <li>Works great, well worth trying</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a coating over the top of my nails that has build up over time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forwards to being able to wear my toes out this summer without nail polish.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>It worked well, but I needed more.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that my nails are looking much better than they ever have before.  </li>
            <li>There are also moisturizers in it that seem to just sink in and make my nails look healthy and well tended.  </li>
            <li>more regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love not having to wear polish to cover the look of a stained nail.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Most over the counter things of this nature promise results, but do nothing.</li>
            <li>Hope it works as advertised:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will work for toes too</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure whether the spots were from a lack of protein or if they were fungal, so I bought this product and Nailtiques Formula 2</li>
            <li>I used it for almost a month without seeing any change and then overnight they looked better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many (10+) treatments, both over the counter and homeopathic, for toe fungus</li>
            <li>I love it but need to use it longer then 1 bottle.</li>
            <li>It works better then prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fungus on my toe nails for many</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 bottles to make sure I do not run out.</li>
            <li>I was able to rid myself of my nail fungus in just about a month of using the product.  </li>
            <li>Two weeks of using Dr G&#x27;s and the nail has re-attached and is looking healthy again.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I like it better than the cream.</li>
            <li>It costs 3 times more at the nail salon if you can find it.</li>
            <li>I used this faithfully twice per day on all toenails, even ones that were not infected just to make sure and nothing happened after 3 bottles....</li>
            <li>I think it works better that his.</li>
            <li>but I decided it was the result of the product that was most important.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend this product if you have an issue!</li>
            <li>I used this and within 3 months my nail is as good as new.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to use it every spring just to be sure my toes are ready for summer!</li>
            <li>He is doing fine with this.</li>
            <li>Very happy since I was having trouble finding a toenail antifungal ointment of any sort.</li>
            <li>I use a nail file to smooth it out and also allow the Dr. G to absorb in the nail.  </li>
            <li>Great price -- much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s -- and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Works much more quickly and better than higher priced ones sold in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>After a full year should be fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My doctor had recommended I use an antifungal treatment to clear up the problem and to be sure and apply it under the affected area in addition to the top of the nail.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This product is not effective on the scalp or nails.&amp;#34;  Shop the Amazon site for the best available price.</li>
            <li>Try it, it really helps, be sure to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and not worked very well.</li>
            <li>So far this product is working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>You have to make it part of your daily regiment for it to be effective</li>
            <li>use this as part of a routine that includes my own nail oil with jojoba and tea tree oil along with vitamin E and another moisturizing oil - which currently is avocado oil.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Liked the product, but have switched to a different brand since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before with success...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that after three months it has cleared up the white discoloration and roughness from my big toe nails.  </li>
            <li>My toe nails are growing out smooth and clear!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and when the first item I received was damaged, I received a replacement quickly and without a hassle.  </li>
            <li>It does work, but you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>I had a nail fungus for many years from walking around swimming pools and public water park areas barefeet.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance instead of just sending it back.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day probably for the first two weeks</li>
            <li>The price is much better here also compared to local stores.</li>
            <li>I am having better results from the regular use of coconut oil!</li>
            <li>What was listed in the description is exactly what arrived.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many products from Amazon since 2006 and have never been sent an alternate product until now.</li>
            <li>First Nail antifungal treatment I have ever used that works immediately.</li>
            <li>I got my first ever nail fungus after years of wearing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I started using this product per the recommendation of a friend and within about 2 weeks, the fungal issue has pretty much dissappated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly saved my nails.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
            <li>thanks Dr G and people at the Salon&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>This product really helps, though.  </li>
            <li>Nail fungus is very persistent so you have to be as well in order to get it under control and then eliminate it</li>
            <li>We used this with vinegar &amp;tea tree oil soaks and the look much healthier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>It will not do much for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>it worked well and worked fast.</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and my doctor said its ok as long as it&#x27;s a topical and not an oral treatment.</li>
            <li>The new nails are growing so pretty</li>
            <li>It takes the nail as a whole, to completely grow out from the time you first start using it.</li>
            <li>Make sure your feet are dry completely before covering them after using the product(s).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using it on a toe that I severely stubbed and it is slowly but surely get better as well</li>
            <li>The nail has to completely grow out from when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I am happy to purchase a second after it has killed the fungus on one toe and has significantly reduced the amount on my other infected toe.</li>
            <li>As the whole new nail grows out then you should see results.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it would ever fix since I tried so many things more expensive than this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that has fungus.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. G&#x27;s for a few weeks and my toe nails do look better.</li>
            <li>and I go right back to getting it on there</li>
            <li>thought I was going to have to live with it.when</li>
            <li>Nail fungus completely gone in days!</li>
            <li>I first found this out of town and finally remembered to check with Amazon to find it.</li>
            <li>First the back of the box clearly states that it is NOT to be used on nails....</li>
            <li>Found vinegar solution worked better.[[ASIN:B001ET70WM Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment, 0.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li>I came across Dr. G&#x60;s clear nail, read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says clearly on the package that it does not work on nails.</li>
            <li>Was looking for the clear solution which was advertised on amazon</li>
            <li>My toe nail was white and very sore.</li>
            <li>This one is working for me so far.  </li>
            <li>nooo then a person stepped on me with their heel and it came off completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once a day, twice so far with the applications spaced a day apart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One must be ready to do this daily, or it will not work.</li>
            <li>Nothing cures toenail fungus completely</li>
            <li>The money spent on this product wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that as my toe nails grow out, the more fungus is will wipe away and my toe nails grow slow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to use it on my right middle finger, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen some progress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about having french tip nails and believe that will be possible in the next month or so.  </li>
            <li>The right hand still has some minor issues but as of this writing, the left hand seems to be clear.  </li>
            <li>a simple coat of clear polish will be my new toe polish.  </li>
            <li>Both of my big toes have a had a large white spot on them for about 3 years</li>
            <li>I can actually where sandals with clear nail polish!</li>
            <li>I have been laboring for several years to get my big toenail on my right foot to grow normally after losing it due to an accident.</li>
            <li>Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution helps get rid of the white, which I&#x27;ve been told is a fungus.  </li>
            <li>The packaging clearly shows a fingernail being treated, however on the back of the box it says It &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work on the scalp or nails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it sometimes takes all winter to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li>G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment which is a cream in a bottle from a local Sallys Store.</li>
            <li>The price was several dollars cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty, but so far, I cannot tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  </li>
            <li>The new nail seems to be growing in normal without the fungus and dark line that was once there.        </li>
            <li>this does take several weeks to work, but it does work and the price is very reasonable, I was giving up on a solution other than have my nails removed..</li>
            <li>I have previously used this product, and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li>Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail is curing this when two different medical doctors could not.</li>
            <li>What I received was the same thing I bought locally the Dr. D&#x27;s Antifungal Treatment instead of the Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, that if you don&#x27;t use if for a few days, it comes back quickly....</li>
            <li>Really thought I would loose the nail several different times...but never did.  </li>
            <li>At first I was little confused because you&#x27;re only supposed to apply this cream to the cuticle but the white is gone and my toes look healthy again.</li>
            <li>This seems to penetrate down into the skin very well and is curing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other products but this always clear up any nail fungus problems quickly and prevents any future damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months and my nail is normal!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working but a little slow for most people.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used it twice a day probably for the first two weeks</li>
            <li> The price is much better here also compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> I am having better results from the regular use of coconut oil!</li>
            <li> What was listed in the description is exactly what arrived.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many products from Amazon since 2006 and have never been sent an alternate product until now.</li>
            <li> First Nail antifungal treatment I have ever used that works immediately.</li>
            <li> I got my first ever nail fungus after years of wearing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I started using this product per the recommendation of a friend and within about 2 weeks, the fungal issue has pretty much dissappated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly saved my nails.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
            <li> thanks Dr G and people at the Salon&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> This product really helps, though.  </li>
            <li> Nail fungus is very persistent so you have to be as well in order to get it under control and then eliminate it</li>
            <li> We used this with vinegar &amp;tea tree oil soaks and the look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> It will not do much for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> it worked well and worked fast.</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and my doctor said its ok as long as it&#x27;s a topical and not an oral treatment.</li>
            <li> The new nails are growing so pretty</li>
            <li> It takes the nail as a whole, to completely grow out from the time you first start using it.</li>
            <li> Make sure your feet are dry completely before covering them after using the product(s).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using it on a toe that I severely stubbed and it is slowly but surely get better as well</li>
            <li> The nail has to completely grow out from when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I am happy to purchase a second after it has killed the fungus on one toe and has significantly reduced the amount on my other infected toe.</li>
            <li> As the whole new nail grows out then you should see results.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it would ever fix since I tried so many things more expensive than this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that has fungus.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. G&#x27;s for a few weeks and my toe nails do look better.</li>
            <li> and I go right back to getting it on there</li>
            <li> thought I was going to have to live with it.when</li>
            <li> Nail fungus completely gone in days!</li>
            <li> I first found this out of town and finally remembered to check with Amazon to find it.</li>
            <li> First the back of the box clearly states that it is NOT to be used on nails....</li>
            <li> Found vinegar solution worked better.[[ASIN:B001ET70WM Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment, 0.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li> I came across Dr. G&#x60;s clear nail, read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says clearly on the package that it does not work on nails.</li>
            <li> Was looking for the clear solution which was advertised on amazon</li>
            <li> My toe nail was white and very sore.</li>
            <li> This one is working for me so far.  </li>
            <li> nooo then a person stepped on me with their heel and it came off completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once a day, twice so far with the applications spaced a day apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One must be ready to do this daily, or it will not work.</li>
            <li> Nothing cures toenail fungus completely</li>
            <li> The money spent on this product wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that as my toe nails grow out, the more fungus is will wipe away and my toe nails grow slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to use it on my right middle finger, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen some progress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about having french tip nails and believe that will be possible in the next month or so.  </li>
            <li> The right hand still has some minor issues but as of this writing, the left hand seems to be clear.  </li>
            <li> a simple coat of clear polish will be my new toe polish.  </li>
            <li> Both of my big toes have a had a large white spot on them for about 3 years</li>
            <li> I can actually where sandals with clear nail polish!</li>
            <li> I have been laboring for several years to get my big toenail on my right foot to grow normally after losing it due to an accident.</li>
            <li> Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution helps get rid of the white, which I&#x27;ve been told is a fungus.  </li>
            <li> The packaging clearly shows a fingernail being treated, however on the back of the box it says It &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work on the scalp or nails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it sometimes takes all winter to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li> G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment which is a cream in a bottle from a local Sallys Store.</li>
            <li> The price was several dollars cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty, but so far, I cannot tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  </li>
            <li> The new nail seems to be growing in normal without the fungus and dark line that was once there.        </li>
            <li> this does take several weeks to work, but it does work and the price is very reasonable, I was giving up on a solution other than have my nails removed..</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product, and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail is curing this when two different medical doctors could not.</li>
            <li> What I received was the same thing I bought locally the Dr. D&#x27;s Antifungal Treatment instead of the Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, that if you don&#x27;t use if for a few days, it comes back quickly....</li>
            <li> Really thought I would loose the nail several different times...but never did.  </li>
            <li> At first I was little confused because you&#x27;re only supposed to apply this cream to the cuticle but the white is gone and my toes look healthy again.</li>
            <li> This seems to penetrate down into the skin very well and is curing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other products but this always clear up any nail fungus problems quickly and prevents any future damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months and my nail is normal!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working but a little slow for most people.  </li>
            <li> It has taken three months to clear up the larger section on my other toe.  </li>
            <li> I used this in the past and it really woked.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to put this on daily, you will see results in about two weeks, and discoloration GONE in about six.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the fungus on one of my toes is completely gone after 4 weeks of use, albeit it was a very minor case compared to my other toe.</li>
            <li> My nail started with a little yellow discoloratin and now the entire nail is yellow.</li>
            <li> As it grows I keep cutting more of the fungus off when I trim my toes nails.</li>
            <li> , you know how long it takes to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> will probably continue to use this for as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> You can apply this twice a day to feet, which are covered in socks and shoes, but how is it going to work on my fingernail when I wash my hands all day long?</li>
            <li> Some would lessen the amount of fungus but would never completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I was getting my nails done professionally for a few years without a break</li>
            <li> and when I took them off, I developed a fungal issue with a few of my nails.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews said that you need to use this stuff religiously to get it to work...</li>
            <li> so I constantly have trouble with nail beds dying and nail plates lifting - or I did before I started using this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have been using different toenail medications for the past 30 years and this one really works I have been using it for the past four months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also added the nail oil to my normal hand lotion and applied all three at least four times a day.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the result expected yet.</li>
            <li> After trying different things to apply it I found squirting a small amount on a toothpick and using it to apply the product worked for me.  </li>
            <li> You will have to use one at night and the other in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My case was extremely severe</li>
            <li> I used both products as recommended for the past month and watched the white spots disappear.</li>
            <li> I recommend alternating it every other day with Fungi Nail solution.  </li>
            <li> I have continued to use the treatment for another 2-3 weeks and had to order another one because the amount per bottle is very minimal compared to other options.</li>
            <li> Actually my nails look worse, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> This is complete false advertising.</li>
            <li> I did file my nails down before I applied the treatment</li>
            <li> When applied every other night, made my toe fungus disappear!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear clear or light polish because it looked so nasty.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for about two and half weeks now</li>
            <li> (I used the Nailtiques because everytime I stubbed my toe, the nail would crack in half</li>
            <li> I have fought a case of black fungus under a nail for over one year.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this product works on my toe nails and clears my fungus in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Cause it eats your polish away and makes it a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few days and cleared up the slight yellowing of the toenail.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I&#x27;d notice the fungus going just a little deeper.  </li>
            <li> My wife got this at a nail Solon for me, and it really works, I&#x27;ve had a serous toenail problem for years and several  doctors have given me solutions that all failed and expensive..</li>
            <li> I can say that if I stop using  Dr. G&#x27;s for a few days, my nail bed start to look as if they&#x27;re giving up again</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a nail that I swear was totally dead.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dr. G&#x27;s was recommended to me by a nail salon technician a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a few months and saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried leaving them bare with no paint and expensive hair/nail supplements with no results.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible toe nail fungus right in the middle of my nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a two because I&#x27;m still not sure.  </li>
            <li> I had a small patch of it on one of my toes that it cleared up within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Been using 2X a day for past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> however  this bottle is just a few months from the expiration  date!  </li>
            <li> States on the box &amp;#34;This product is not effective on scalp or nails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (you may have guessed I&#x27;m a bit clumsy).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say this product is a must for anyone who has a tendency to get infections, especially for those who use acrylic, gel, solar or glue-on artificial nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not effective on nail; fraudulentlycalled clearnail</li>
            <li> Since I wear toenail polish a lot, I can&#x27;t see if there is a problem until it is too late.</li>
            <li> but i subtracted a star because it says on the bottle it is NOT EFFECTIVE ON NAILS even though it is advertised for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> The reason is because it is extremely difficult to use , and messy.</li>
            <li> but it does slowly grow out!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nasty green fungus make a home under my left hand thumb nail for five plus years now.  </li>
            <li> I started that regiment back in July and that nasty green fungus at towards the tip of my nail now.  </li>
            <li> The fungus has not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> It can be used with or without polish or even false nails.  </li>
            <li> The box for this also says it&#x27;s not for use on nails, which I found very confusing!  </li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought some over the counter at the drug store and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I even got a fake nail put on just until the rest grew in but</li>
            <li> As a result, I skeptically purchased this antifungal treatment doubting it would help since nothing else has.</li>
            <li> Also, my husband has artificial knees and could not take the oral meds.</li>
            <li> I did have fungus and if you&#x27;ve ever had a bad case</li>
            <li> It took a while as my boyfriends feet were really bad.</li>
            <li> His doctor gave him a prescription they were so bad.</li>
            <li> The fungus on my nails wasn&#x27;t as bad as some people&#x27;s but still ugly and this treatment is helping.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> States on the box &amp;#34;This product is not effective on scalp or nails&amp;#34;. Product has a misleading name. It is for the treatment of athlete&#x27;s foot or ringworm.</li>
            <li> I gave it a two because I&#x27;m still not sure.  I&#x27;m thinking that as my toe nails grow out, the more fungus is will wipe away and my toe nails grow slow.</li>
            <li> Nail fungus completely gone in days! I had white nail fungus on about a quarter of my big toenail, started using this stuff and it was gone in about 4 days. Very happy since I was having trouble finding a toenail antifungal ointment of any sort. Amazon saves the day!</li>
            <li> Purchased to treat toenail fungus.  Found vinegar solution worked better.[[ASIN:B001ET70WM Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment, 0.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Cleared up my funky toenails. Used morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have been using different toenail medications for the past 30 years and this one really works I have been using it for the past four months and my nails look beautiful</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I stoved my finger several months ago and it was starting to detach.  I used this and within 3 months my nail is as good as new.  I&#x27;m currently using it on a toe that I severely stubbed and it is slowly but surely get better as well (you may have guessed I&#x27;m a bit clumsy).  I&#x27;m diabetic so things take longer to heal but I didn&#x27;t think the healing time was outlandish.  You have to make it part of your daily regiment for it to be effective but it&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid problem and diabetes 2 which affects my nails.  Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution helps get rid of the white, which I&#x27;ve been told is a fungus.  Try it, it really helps, be sure to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> My wife got this at a nail Solon for me, and it really works, I&#x27;ve had a serous toenail problem for years and several  doctors have given me solutions that all failed and expensive..this does take several weeks to work, but it does work and the price is very reasonable, I was giving up on a solution other than have my nails removed..thanks Dr G and people at the Salon&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> It does work, but you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> As described. Seems to be working</li>
            <li> This item worked quickly on clearing up the fungal infection on my great toe. The only thing is, that if you don&#x27;t use if for a few days, it comes back quickly....I am trying again without interruptions to see if that totally clears it up.</li>
            <li> my husband says that this clear nail worked wonderful</li>
            <li> I bought this in January but waited several months to review it to see if it worked or not.  I&#x27;m happy to report that after three months it has cleared up the white discoloration and roughness from my big toe nails.  I had a small patch of it on one of my toes that it cleared up within a couple of weeks.  It has taken three months to clear up the larger section on my other toe.  I only used it once a day instead of the recommended twice a day so it may have cleared up sooner than that had I used it twice a day.  I considered rating this four stars as there is no applicator for it and so it&#x27;s difficult to apply but I decided it was the result of the product that was most important.  After trying different things to apply it I found squirting a small amount on a toothpick and using it to apply the product worked for me.  My doctor had recommended I use an antifungal treatment to clear up the problem and to be sure and apply it under the affected area in addition to the top of the nail.  I am assuming the fungus is gone and have discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> So far this product is working pretty good.  I have been using it for about three months now.  It&#x27;s working but a little slow for most people.  I&#x27;ve noticed a coating over the top of my nails that has build up over time.  I use a nail file to smooth it out and also allow the Dr. G to absorb in the nail.  The new nail seems to be growing in normal without the fungus and dark line that was once there.        I had a nail fungus for many years from walking around swimming pools and public water park areas barefeet.  Prior to using this product, i was using Xenna-Nonyx which helped to get the fungus under control over a period of 9 months. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the fungus under control, I want my nails clearer.       I believe using both products will help speed up the process.  You will have to use one at night and the other in the morning.  Soaking your feet in Epson salt as much as possible is also going to help.  Make sure your feet are dry completely before covering them after using the product(s).  My case was extremely severe so I had to have patience with whatever products I used.       I&#x27;m looking forwards to being able to wear my toes out this summer without nail polish.  The new nails are growing so pretty a simple coat of clear polish will be my new toe polish.  So give it time to work and don&#x27;t use polish.  I didn&#x27;t give this product (5) stars because I used another product as mentioned earlier.  You&#x27;ll love it when it&#x27;s all said and done. Good luck!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nasty green fungus make a home under my left hand thumb nail for five plus years now.  At times with no cause, my thumb would hurt like I hit it with a hammer.  That&#x27;s when I&#x27;d notice the fungus going just a little deeper.  Really thought I would loose the nail several different times...but never did.  I couldn&#x27;t wear clear or light polish because it looked so nasty.  It even changed the shape of my thumbnail...it&#x27;s quite a bit wider now.  It was a nail salon that turned me on to this and told me to put it under my nail and rub on cuticle 2 times daily.  I started that regiment back in July and that nasty green fungus at towards the tip of my nail now.  I&#x27;m so excited about having french tip nails and believe that will be possible in the next month or so.  Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail is curing this when two different medical doctors could not.</li>
            <li> My nail salon sold me a bottle of this after seeing I had fungus on a toe from another salon.  It worked well, but I needed more.  Unfortunately, I bought some over the counter at the drug store and it did nothing.  Buying a couple of this product now!</li>
            <li> I thought I had reviewed this already but maybe it got lost in the shuffle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for two years but don&#x27;t let the time scare you off.  I am diabetic so I constantly have trouble with nail beds dying and nail plates lifting - or I did before I started using this on a regular basis.  I did have fungus and if you&#x27;ve ever had a bad case, you know how long it takes to get rid of it.  This product really helps, though.  Just don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle.  Nail fungus is very persistent so you have to be as well in order to get it under control and then eliminate it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve no idea if continuing to use the product is harmful.  All I know is that my nails are looking much better than they ever have before.  There are also moisturizers in it that seem to just sink in and make my nails look healthy and well tended.  Even when I no longer see problems, I plan to continue to use this as a preventative.  It can be used with or without polish or even false nails.  Just squirt some into the underneath part of the nail tip so that it saturates that end of the nail bed.  I also leave a space between polish and cuticles and it can get in there, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as part of a routine that includes my own nail oil with jojoba and tea tree oil along with vitamin E and another moisturizing oil - which currently is avocado oil.  I&#x27;ve also added the nail oil to my normal hand lotion and applied all three at least four times a day.  The right hand still has some minor issues but as of this writing, the left hand seems to be clear.  I can say that if I stop using  Dr. G&#x27;s for a few days, my nail bed start to look as if they&#x27;re giving up again and I go right back to getting it on there more regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to use this for as long as they make it.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever stop.  It&#x27;s certainly saved my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 1 week twice a day. It&#x27;s great stuff. My toe nail was white and very sore. The white is almost gone and  soreness is as well. I highly recommend this to anyone that has fungus. This is a  great product. That&#x27;s to the friend that recommend this to me.</li>
            <li> The money spent on this product wasn&#x27;t worth it. My nail started with a little yellow discoloratin and now the entire nail is yellow. So the product didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll just go see the doctor instead of an off the chelf product.</li>
            <li> Took some time but eased the pain</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It took a while as my boyfriends feet were really bad. His doctor gave him a prescription they were so bad. We used this with vinegar &amp;tea tree oil soaks and the look much healthier. Buy 2 at once as the price is great and you may need to use it for a month or two esp. If your nails have fungus. They reinfect the toes.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few days and cleared up the slight yellowing of the toenail. I love not having to wear polish to cover the look of a stained nail. Highly recommend for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Read the directions on the box. &amp;#34;This product is not effective on the scalp or nails.&amp;#34;  Shop the Amazon site for the best available price.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Shipping was fast, and when the first item I received was damaged, I received a replacement quickly and without a hassle.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the result expected yet. Been using 2X a day for past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just received this, and I find the package deceptive.  There are photos of fingernails, and nail fungus is my problem.  However, on the back of the package, it looks like this is meant just for toenails (athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm).  All the talk is about feet.  You can apply this twice a day to feet, which are covered in socks and shoes, but how is it going to work on my fingernail when I wash my hands all day long?</li>
            <li> I tried several products for toenail fungus that did not work.  This one is working for me so far.  My toenail is growing out beautifully.  It is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a nail that I swear was totally dead.  A car went over my toe and the nail just wasn&#x27;t the same after the bruising. I even got a fake nail put on just until the rest grew in but nooo then a person stepped on me with their heel and it came off completely.  From there it grew but it had a fungus type thing and I didn&#x27;t think it would ever fix since I tried so many things more expensive than this.  It&#x27;s been a few months and my nail is normal!! I love this product and I even recommended it to my father in law and my husband started using it as well.</li>
            <li> Must use the product for a period of time, I&#x27;ve been six months now and just now seeing a good improvement.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged just keep using it. As the whole new nail grows out then you should see results.  It takes the nail as a whole, to completely grow out from the time you first start using it. After a full year should be fantastic.  The nail has to completely grow out from when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> I have had toe-nail fungus for years and nothing worked.  Even did the Lamisil route with the blood tests for liver damage (not recommended) as it came back.  Been using this product for about two and half weeks now and I can see actual progress with the toe-nail which has always been the toughest.  Will update the recommendation in four weeks.</li>
            <li> Most over the counter things of this nature promise results, but do nothing. As long as you remember to put this on daily, you will see results in about two weeks, and discoloration GONE in about six. I swear by this stuff. I make sure to use it every spring just to be sure my toes are ready for summer!</li>
            <li> Advertised for your nails but says on the label doesn&#x27;t work on nails. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The headline, photograph and description of ingredients lead one to believe this product is the Antimicrobial however, once you purchase this, the headline changes to Antifungal containing Tolnaftate.  Tolnaftate works on fungal infections on skin....just like the jock itch and athletes foot products found in stores.  It will not do much for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. G&#x27;s for a few weeks and my toe nails do look better. I did file my nails down before I applied the treatment and I have not been polishing my nails. I don&#x27;t know if it is a cure but it does definitely improve the appearance of nails.</li>
            <li> Dr. G&#x27;s was recommended to me by a nail salon technician a few years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other products but this always clear up any nail fungus problems quickly and prevents any future damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say this product is a must for anyone who has a tendency to get infections, especially for those who use acrylic, gel, solar or glue-on artificial nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even did a video about it!  [...]</li>
            <li> The packaging clearly shows a fingernail being treated, however on the back of the box it says It &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work on the scalp or nails&amp;#34;. What the heck? I&#x27;m still trying to use it on my right middle finger, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen some progress. My nails is clearing up and it&#x27;s only been a couple days. It says to use twice a day, daily. I&#x27;ve used it once a day, twice so far with the applications spaced a day apart. I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance instead of just sending it back.</li>
            <li> Hope it works as advertised:)</li>
            <li> fungus improved but never went away.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, but it is a slip process</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking weeks to clear up. The YouTube video said days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not working not in 4 weeks, not in 8..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works yet....the packaging only gives instructions for athletes foot and ring worm. Nail fungus is not listed on this box. I&#x27;m sure it will work for toes too but I would have liked it to be mentioned on the box.</li>
            <li> Both of my big toes have a had a large white spot on them for about 3 years and I just about gave up trying to get rid them. I&#x27;ve tried leaving them bare with no paint and expensive hair/nail supplements with no results. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether the spots were from a lack of protein or if they were fungal, so I bought this product and Nailtiques Formula 2 Plus. I used both products as recommended for the past month and watched the white spots disappear. (I used the Nailtiques because everytime I stubbed my toe, the nail would crack in half so I wanted to try a hardener.) At first I was little confused because you&#x27;re only supposed to apply this cream to the cuticle but the white is gone and my toes look healthy again. Some other reviews said that you need to use this stuff religiously to get it to work...I used it twice a day probably for the first two weeks and then I started to forget here and there. I used it for almost a month without seeing any change and then overnight they looked better.</li>
            <li> If you use this product daily, you will see results.  It takes some time and effort, but you will see your fungus going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must be ready to do this daily, or it will not work.</li>
            <li> The price was several dollars cheaper than Sally&#x27;s Beauty, but so far, I cannot tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  The fungus has not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> I have been laboring for several years to get my big toenail on my right foot to grow normally after losing it due to an accident. I have tried many products and not worked very well. I kept getting the white fungus while nail was growing out and then I would lose the nail all over again. I now finally have a toenail and I purchase this product after searching the website and reading reviews. It is working really good for me. I like the fact you can put it over nail polish and still get good results.</li>
            <li> When applied every other night, made my toe fungus disappear!</li>
            <li> Liked the product, but have switched to a different brand since.  The box for this also says it&#x27;s not for use on nails, which I found very confusing!  Used it anyway.</li>
            <li> Have used before and it works.  The only problem is it sometimes takes all winter to clear up a fungus.</li>
            <li> Kind of like it. Still testing it tho.</li>
            <li> not effective on nail; fraudulentlycalled clearnail</li>
            <li> It actually works! I have tried many (10+) treatments, both over the counter and homeopathic, for toe fungus but nothing has seemed to truly cure the issue. Some would lessen the amount of fungus but would never completely get rid of it. As a result, I skeptically purchased this antifungal treatment doubting it would help since nothing else has. To my surprise, the fungus on one of my toes is completely gone after 4 weeks of use, albeit it was a very minor case compared to my other toe. I have continued to use the treatment for another 2-3 weeks and had to order another one because the amount per bottle is very minimal compared to other options. Regardless, I am happy to purchase a second after it has killed the fungus on one toe and has significantly reduced the amount on my other infected toe. I am optimistic about using one more bottle to get rid of the fungus on both toes and get rid of it for good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1-2 weeks and I see a difference. The fungus on my nails wasn&#x27;t as bad as some people&#x27;s but still ugly and this treatment is helping. I am 7 months pregnant and my doctor said its ok as long as it&#x27;s a topical and not an oral treatment. I&#x27;d use it again but hopefully it doesn&#x27;t come to that.</li>
            <li> Works great, well worth trying</li>
            <li> I had a horrible toe nail fungus right in the middle of my nail bed.  I have to say that it did take two bottles of this but it does slowly grow out!  It&#x27;s almost gone!  As it grows I keep cutting more of the fungus off when I trim my toes nails. You can also still keep your toes polished. It does not interfere with it at all!</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months and saw no improvement. Actually my nails look worse, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> Appears to work good. My toe nails are growing out smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> I first found this out of town and finally remembered to check with Amazon to find it. I love it but need to use it longer then 1 bottle. It works better then prescription stuff. Also, my husband has artificial knees and could not take the oral meds. He is doing fine with this. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Has worked great for my husband!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fungus on my toe nails for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was going to have to live with it.when I started shopping around to possibly find something that would work. I came across Dr. G&#x60;s clear nail, read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did! Within a week I could see the difference! You have to put it under the nail and on the nail bed in the a.m.and p.m. you will be amazed at the results. I can actually where sandals with clear nail polish!</li>
            <li> This is junk. First the back of the box clearly states that it is NOT to be used on nails....what? second, it says you do not need to remove polish...you know why? Cause it eats your polish away and makes it a sticky mess. I requested a refund, hopefully I get my money back</li>
            <li> It says clearly on the package that it does not work on nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months now. No change.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you if this is effective or not. The reason is because it is extremely difficult to use , and messy. I stopped using it and ordered a different product here, one that has a brush that makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Gret stuff. I purchased 2 bottles to make sure I do not run out. I used this in the past and it really woked. Since I wear toenail polish a lot, I can&#x27;t see if there is a problem until it is too late. The price is much better here also compared to local stores. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had this on subscribe and save for a couple of years now, and it seemed to help a bit, but not enough to cure the problem.  I am having better results from the regular use of coconut oil!</li>
            <li> I was getting my nails done professionally for a few years without a break and when I took them off, I developed a fungal issue with a few of my nails. I started using this product per the recommendation of a friend and within about 2 weeks, the fungal issue has pretty much dissappated. I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend this product if you have an issue!</li>
            <li> I was able to rid myself of my nail fungus in just about a month of using the product.  My sister recommended it and it worked for her as well.</li>
            <li> I have fought a case of black fungus under a nail for over one year. I used the vinegar solution and it did not touch the problem. Two weeks of using Dr G&#x27;s and the nail has re-attached and is looking healthy again. Great price -- much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s -- and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> What was listed in the description is exactly what arrived.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before with success...however  this bottle is just a few months from the expiration  date!  Not at all happy about that so I do not recommend this  seller.</li>
            <li> It works very well but i subtracted a star because it says on the bottle it is NOT EFFECTIVE ON NAILS even though it is advertised for nail fungus. This is complete false advertising. I struggled to get rid of a fungus on the palm of my hand which i caught from a handlebar at the gym for over 5 years. This seems to penetrate down into the skin very well and is curing it.</li>
            <li> Works much more quickly and better than higher priced ones sold in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product, and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> Used it for a year and never had any yellowing orthickened nails problems.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t use a brush, you just dab it on.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased DR. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment which is a cream in a bottle from a local Sallys Store. Was looking for the clear solution which was advertised on amazon so I purchased it. What I received was the same thing I bought locally the Dr. D&#x27;s Antifungal Treatment instead of the Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Solution. I bought this product because I like it better than the cream. Am very dissatisfied. I have purchased many products from Amazon since 2006 and have never been sent an alternate product until now.</li>
            <li> First Nail antifungal treatment I have ever used that works immediately. It costs 3 times more at the nail salon if you can find it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this product works on my toe nails and clears my fungus in less than a week. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Nothing cures toenail fungus completely but this is helping.  I recommend alternating it every other day with Fungi Nail solution.  The result is a varying fungus killer that keeps the the stuff at bay.</li>
            <li> Follow directions to a T. Fungus gone in a month. Great solution.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully twice per day on all toenails, even ones that were not infected just to make sure and nothing happened after 3 bottles....</li>
            <li> same strength as a $39.00 bottle I got from podiatrist. I think it works better that his.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this product. it worked well and worked fast. I got my first ever nail fungus after years of wearing acrylic nails. My nail tech found it during a fill and suggested this stuff. It works.</li>
