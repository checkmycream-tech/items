    <ol>
            <li>The product is great, just can issues~  Please see my updated response below!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Awesome one-time use, but one star because you can&#x27;t use it after that.</li>
            <li>Incredibly, she relayed to me that her sister bought a can of this stuff about a year ago, never used it, so she gave it to my wife, thinking she would like it.  </li>
            <li>and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>My hair looked good when I got up.</li>
            <li>I was impressed at first</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair, this is amazing for in between washings.  </li>
            <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame - I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would work well, and worked great the first time that I used it!  </li>
            <li>I tried it on clean hair and loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Like many here, she just figured it was a faulty bottle, though she thankfully never purchased another one to find</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I loved the smell and the way it was making my hair look.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that this is the best dry shampoo I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>I like the light formula and the scent is much better than most, but it&#x27;s an unusable product as-is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good to go whole day.</li>
            <li>love the fresh scent of this spray!</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>The first - and only - use of this was AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It made my second-day hair look even better than when it&#x27;s freshly washed.</li>
            <li>and it is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>make sure to shake the can right before using and after each spray and have had no problems with clogging.</li>
            <li>Mine won&#x27;t even spray anymore and the can is still full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s such a good product</li>
            <li>I tried cleaning it with hot water and using fine needles but nothing made it work again.</li>
            <li>I have been a faithful, loyal customer to Pantene products for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li>BUT, after the first application, it stopped working!  </li>
            <li>I tried twice, thinking the first bottle was just a fluke after it stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li>And yes, I tried cleaning the nozzle with hot water before and after use; this is not my first aerosol can.</li>
            <li>After buying this product twice in the last 6 months, I have to guess that the manufacturer has resolved the problem---I had no clogging issues with either can, and was able to use all the contents to the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure enough, after about three applications, the bottle clogged.  </li>
            <li>This means Pantene knew it was defective and kept shipping for a year (and most likely are still shipping).</li>
            <li>It stopped working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how clean my hair felt</li>
            <li>But even before that happened, I didn&#x27;t care for it much; it made my hair feel chalky, and my hair still looked pretty greasy after using the product.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I found these poor reviews of the product when googling for &amp;#34;pantene dry shampoo clogged.&amp;#34;  My can is nearly full, and after seeing all of these other reviews and reading how many people before me have tried to unclog it without success, I will probably just throw it away to cut my losses and not throw more good time at it.</li>
            <li>Then I gave it a second try, thinking that maybe I just have to clean it out right from the start.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the product until I was about half way through my bottle when the sprayer no longer worked.</li>
            <li>It is such a shame and switching products is NOT an easy thing to do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>There are much better dry shampoos out there-</li>
            <li>I bought the Original Fresh Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V Original Fresh Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>worked really well.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>Or how much you should put in.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>It smells great unlike so many other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (upwards of 15 now) like other reviewers said, It clogs and is virtually uncloggable.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found my new favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use it the next morning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had far better experiences with L&#x27;Oreal EverStyle and Toni and Guy dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s rubbed in and thoroughly brushed out, I have a great-smelling head of hair with full body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great fresh, clean scent which doesn&#x27;t linger in the room long after applying like another dry shampoo I tried (Dove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like to spray a little of this into my just-washed hair if I plan to do a braid or updo: it adds just enough texture to help keep the style together nicely.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and brushes out with little effort with no powder residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not cool losing to the cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>The market is full of other products that work and companies that won&#x27;t keep selling something they know is faulty.</li>
            <li>I would implore you to call and let them know so the issue can be fixed.</li>
            <li>Hers leaks everywhere and completely came out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>My whole head looked gross.</li>
            <li>The new can lasted through only one use!</li>
            <li>Great product,terrible terrible cheap packaging.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel dirty and it smelled pleasant to boot.  </li>
            <li>It barely does anything and price was over 4$ at Walmart!</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve tried hot water, it only works a little bit.  </li>
            <li>As far as dry shampoo goes.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across these reviews when googling &amp;#34;pantene dry shampoo clog&amp;#34; because, you guessed it, after one use the can is completely clogged up.</li>

            <li> wife also agreed that the few times it worked, it was a great product, but was overall very disappointed by a fact a large corporation seemingly cannot afford to mass purchase spray cans that work.</li>

            <li> I had a similar experience as a number of others--I used it a few times, and then the can clogged completely.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, especially I am a loyal Pantene customer.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it was a fluke because the same thing had happened with other brands of dry shampoo, so I purchased another can.</li>

            <li> Too bad the nozzle clogs so easily!</li>
            <li> I only get to use about half the can</li>

            <li> I usually use batiste, but I saw this at a local store and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Such a waste!</li>
            <li> Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a complaint about a product that I not only purchased once, but twice.</li>
            <li> It was fine for 2 uses and then the bottle seems almost empty while I only used a little bit of it,  and it spits liquid now... really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Here I am AGAIN about half way through my bottle and it no longer sprays.</li>
            <li> Seems odd they didn&#x27;t get ahead of the problem - fix</li>

            <li> let it sit for a few minutes and brush off.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> But waste of $.</li>
            <li> The nozzle clogs after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $13.00 -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After the 6th application, it went dead.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sprayed this crap in to absorb any extra unwanted oil near the roots, and viola!</li>
            <li> I am not sure it does anything.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> and it is not able to be used after that.</li>
            <li> This sucks</li>
            <li> whatever - at least pull it from continued purchases.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the other reviewers are correct.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed to have paid for only one use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that a brand such as Pantene can&#x27;t get their packaging to work.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a badly designed can.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stumbling on this product, I randomly informed my wife never to buy it, citing all the problems people have had with the spray can, as she likes Pantene products.  </li>
            <li> and my can was clogged and useless.</li>
            <li> But after a few hours I had an itchy scalp, it was really bad!</li>
            <li> So disappointing-</li>
            <li> It is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> and it is all because of your horrible nozzle design on your product.</li>

            <li> I bought the Original Fresh Dry Shampoo.I was thrilled with the product until I was about half way through my bottle when the sprayer no longer worked. It was like all of the pressure in the can dissipated and it no longer would spray any product. I thought it was a fluke so I threw that bottle out and repurchased. Here I am AGAIN about half way through my bottle and it no longer sprays. I called Pantene and reported my issues and they sent me coupons as well as took all my info. The company is sending for the bottle to investigate and address any issues. I would implore you to call and let them know so the issue can be fixed. The product is great, just can issues~  Please see my updated response below!!</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair, this is amazing for in between washings.  I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;dry Shampoos&amp;#34;, most have had nasty smells and don&#x27;t work too well.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day.  I spray this in my bangs let it sit for a few minutes and brush off.  I&#x27;m good to go whole day.</li>
            <li> It was fine for 2 uses and then the bottle seems almost empty while I only used a little bit of it,  and it spits liquid now... really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that this is the best dry shampoo I have EVER used. Too bad the nozzle clogs so easily! I only get to use about half the can and then I have to throw the rest out. I have tried cleaning the nozzle, but there&#x27;s no unclogging it. Too bad. I really like this stuff and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> worked really well. I was surprised how clean my hair felt and it smelled great.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product. My roommate and I both got a bottle. Hers leaks everywhere and completely came out of the bottle. Mine won&#x27;t even spray anymore and the can is still full. These problems both happened only a week after the purchase. Do NOT get this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same problem as everyone else with clogged nozzles. I tried twice, thinking the first bottle was just a fluke after it stopped working after the first use. But with the second bottle I only got about 4 uses before it quit working. And yes, I tried cleaning the nozzle with hot water before and after use; this is not my first aerosol can. So disappointing- I like the light formula and the scent is much better than most, but it&#x27;s an unusable product as-is.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I usually use batiste, but I saw this at a local store and decided to try it. Sometimes I use dry shampoo in the AM if I showered the night before to prevent it from looking oily later in the day. My hair looked good when I got up. Sprayed this crap in to absorb any extra unwanted oil near the roots, and viola! My whole head looked gross. It looked like i took oil slick and ran it through my whole hair. I followed the directions and I&#x27;m not exactly new to dry shampoo. I have really fine hair and I must shower daily or it&#x27;s greasy. But this instead of slowing the progress of greasiness, sped it up tenfold. Super disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Clogged as well after 2-3 uses! I did call company though and they issued me a refund thankfully!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would work well, and worked great the first time that I used it!  My hair didn&#x27;t feel dirty and it smelled pleasant to boot.  BUT, after the first application, it stopped working!  I can shake the bottle and feel quite a lot of product sloshing about, but none of it will come out.  I was extremely disappointed to have paid for only one use!</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about trying this particular dry shampoo, since so many reviewers said in the past there was an issue with the spray nozzle clogging. After buying this product twice in the last 6 months, I have to guess that the manufacturer has resolved the problem---I had no clogging issues with either can, and was able to use all the contents to the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fresh scent of this spray! It has enough of a powder component to really absorb oil, yet doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a weird residue. Once it&#x27;s rubbed in and thoroughly brushed out, I have a great-smelling head of hair with full body. Unlike another product I tried ([[ASIN:B00CZE9YHO Garnier Dry Shampoo]]), my hair doesn&#x27;t feel tangled or dry after using this. I also like to spray a little of this into my just-washed hair if I plan to do a braid or updo: it adds just enough texture to help keep the style together nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great unlike so many other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (upwards of 15 now) like other reviewers said, It clogs and is virtually uncloggable. I too, bought another, thinking it was just a fluke, but it&#x27;s not. Great product,terrible terrible cheap packaging. I expected more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use and brushes out with little effort with no powder residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same can for almost four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fresh, clean scent which doesn&#x27;t linger in the room long after applying like another dry shampoo I tried (Dove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to shake the can right before using and after each spray and have had no problems with clogging.</li>
            <li> I just figured I would pile on this product while it&#x27;s down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stumbling on this product, I randomly informed my wife never to buy it, citing all the problems people have had with the spray can, as she likes Pantene products.  Incredibly, she relayed to me that her sister bought a can of this stuff about a year ago, never used it, so she gave it to my wife, thinking she would like it.  Sure enough, after about three applications, the bottle clogged.  Like many here, she just figured it was a faulty bottle, though she thankfully never purchased another one to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also agreed that the few times it worked, it was a great product, but was overall very disappointed by a fact a large corporation seemingly cannot afford to mass purchase spray cans that work.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it does anything.....I was impressed at first cause it&#x27;s not your typical starchy whitish substance but plain spray. Instructions say -shake, spray, rub in, brush.... It barely does anything and price was over 4$ at Walmart! It&#x27;s not cheap! Smells nice though. But waste of $.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I found these poor reviews of the product when googling for &amp;#34;pantene dry shampoo clogged.&amp;#34;  My can is nearly full, and after seeing all of these other reviews and reading how many people before me have tried to unclog it without success, I will probably just throw it away to cut my losses and not throw more good time at it.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found my new favorite dry shampoo. It made my second-day hair look even better than when it&#x27;s freshly washed. Unfortunately, the other reviewers are correct. My can also clogged after only two uses. I thought perhaps it was a fluke because the same thing had happened with other brands of dry shampoo, so I purchased another can. The new can lasted through only one use! Don&#x27;t waste your money on a badly designed can.</li>
            <li> The nozzle clogs after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. But after a few hours I had an itchy scalp, it was really bad! Maybe it all depends on your hair? Or how much you should put in. Then again I didnt put alot in. Not really worth it. Probably wont use it again.</li>
            <li> Just as described and works well</li>
            <li> I have a complaint about a product that I not only purchased once, but twice. I have had the same problem both times. The Pantene Pro-V Original Fresh Dry Shampoo. Both times I use it once and it is not able to be used after that. The nozzle does NOT work. This is ridiculous. I have been a faithful, loyal customer to Pantene products for over 10 years now. Because of this issue. TWICE. I am now in the process of researching. Asking friends and moving on from Pantene. You will no longer be receiving my business. It is such a shame and switching products is NOT an easy thing to do. There is a lot of trial and error. This sucks and it is all because of your horrible nozzle design on your product. Thanks a lot. I can say.. I have recently tried Suave Professionals Salon Proven (yellow cap) dry shampoo and it is FABULOUS. Not cool losing to the cheap alternative. As far as dry shampoo goes. I am a Suave lover now.</li>
            <li> Same here - clogged nozzle after 3 uses. It&#x27;s a shame - I liked the product. So I wandered out to Pantene.com to write a review only to learn the nozzles have been clogging for over a year. I bought it weeks ago. This means Pantene knew it was defective and kept shipping for a year (and most likely are still shipping). Seems odd they didn&#x27;t get ahead of the problem - fix it - offer exchanges - whatever - at least pull it from continued purchases. The market is full of other products that work and companies that won&#x27;t keep selling something they know is faulty.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I loved the smell and the way it was making my hair look. But after two or three applications, the spray can got clogged and nothing came out anymore. I tried cleaning it with hot water and using fine needles but nothing made it work again. Then I gave it a second try, thinking that maybe I just have to clean it out right from the start. Nope. It stopped working after the first time I used it. What a waste of $13.00 - that&#x27;s quite some money for just 3 applications of the product.</li>
            <li> I had a similar experience as a number of others--I used it a few times, and then the can clogged completely. But even before that happened, I didn&#x27;t care for it much; it made my hair feel chalky, and my hair still looked pretty greasy after using the product. I&#x27;ve had far better experiences with L&#x27;Oreal EverStyle and Toni and Guy dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this stuff works. I tried it on clean hair and loved the smell. I was really excited to use it the next morning and my can was clogged and useless. Such a waste!</li>
            <li> I stumbled across these reviews when googling &amp;#34;pantene dry shampoo clog&amp;#34; because, you guessed it, after one use the can is completely clogged up. I&#x27;ve tried every trick in the book to unclog it.  The first - and only - use of this was AWESOME. 2 days later I went to use it again, and pfft, nothing. I&#x27;m so disappointed that a brand such as Pantene can&#x27;t get their packaging to work.  Awesome one-time use, but one star because you can&#x27;t use it after that. At all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this, I thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  The sprayer clogged after one use on both of the cans I bought. It is disappointing.  I don&#x27;t think I will be giving Pantene dry shampoo a third chance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo. Except after using it one time the bottle quits working and I can&#x27;t get it to spray. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased that it&#x27;s done this! You can hear there is still a lot left in the bottle but it won&#x27;t work. By reading all these comments I can tell I am not the only one. It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s such a good product but I&#x27;m not going to keep buying it to only get one use out of it.</li>
            <li> Pantene has to fix this problem.  After the 6th application, it went dead.  I went ahead and send an email to complain to Pantene, I will get my money back and they told me how to fix the problem.  Well, I&#x27;ve tried hot water, it only works a little bit.  Very disappointing, especially I am a loyal Pantene customer.</li>
            <li> Bottle clogged after 3 applications. There are much better dry shampoos out there- don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one</li>
