            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>but this brand did not work good....  </li>
            <li>could see this working good if your button broke while at work or away from home, and you couldn&#x27;t change your jeans at that time.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li>They made the shorts fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>Convenient, good idea.  </li>
            <li>They have excellent customer service and really just want to see their customers happy.</li>
            <li>Works perfect, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I foresee many uses for this great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great temporary solution though, or I would use them if I had a pair of favorite jeans that I just couldn&#x27;t bear to let go of.</li>
            <li>I am buying some more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>This is a great and easy replacement for a lost button,especially if you can&#x27;t sew like me.</li>
            <li>They look nice, as well, but we haven&#x27;t tried them yet (more to come!).</li>
            <li>This brand is amazing</li>
            <li>The one that works is nice.</li>
            <li>This is truly Awesome, I love to give it  4.75/5( -.25 for expense) but totally worth it</li>
            <li>are popular brand named jeans.)</li>
            <li>I really liked these.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service at Bristols 6 is excellent and their product appears to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, works good for the purpose</li>
            <li>When i got the button, it took no space at all, fit well and the jeans feel so good.</li>
            <li>had to return for a refund which was a smooth transaction but looked like a good product.</li>
            <li>The backing seems to lock on securely which is good.</li>
            <li>These are amazingly easy to use...and look just like jeans buttons!</li>
            <li>These tie tack buttons are very well made and make every pair of lants fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviewers have covered what needs to be said about this item.</li>
            <li>i just love them.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Tailoring the pants works better, but jeans are a lot of layers to try to sew through.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this.  </li>
            <li>Glad two buttons come in the pack.  </li>
            <li>Had a favorite pair of jeans that lost their button and</li>
            <li>Love these buttons.</li>
            <li>They work well, and look authentic.  </li>
            <li>and I love that you get two.</li>
            <li>They were not noticeable to anyone else since they sit inside the pants for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They just need a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Good customer service too as the factory forgot to include the backs on the set I first received.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, strong and stylish.  </li>
            <li>Sweet idea!</li>
            <li>I guess it would also be good to use when I start working out for my new year&#x27;s resolution....keeping my jeans on me when they (hopefully!)</li>
            <li>They are easy for me to push thru the material and hold well.  </li>
            <li>These metal buttons are easy to apply and have solved the problem for me.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use product that performs in the manner it was intended.  </li>
            <li>This way I can tighten or loosen my waist band easily as needed.</li>
            <li>This item is easy to put in , easy to take off and does the job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use,</li>
            <li>EASY ON AND OFF.</li>
            <li>I thought this product works just fine</li>
            <li>I suppose if you leave it on permanently it would be fine</li>
            <li>Stayed on fine, was comfortable too.</li>
            <li>baggy, tight or just a perfect fit</li>
            <li>I have always had problems with the waistline fit of pants as well as gaining and losing weight.</li>
            <li>I had lost some weight and none of my jeans fit anymore.  </li>
            <li>ITS FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I got CHEAP shorts</li>
            <li>I thought I would want to remove the original button on my jeans, but they are perfectly comfortable with both buttons.</li>
            <li>These are a quick and easy fix for jeans that could use an inch or two of tightening.  </li>
            <li>Super duper easy.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for me though!</li>
            <li>No one notices these are not the original buttons.  </li>
            <li>If you are expanding the waist, you can&#x27;t tuck or both this and original button are seen.</li>
            <li>They look like original jean buttons and do not ruin pants.</li>
            <li>Put one of these on a pair of jeans which had lost a button...super fast and easy fix!  </li>
            <li>These work - even as a plus sized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in between sizes right now, and instead of buying more pants that won&#x27;t fit right, I got these.</li>
            <li>$15 may sound like a lot for \\&quot;buttons\\&quot; but when I think of how much money it saves on pants, it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>cant say enough Good stuff about this item.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought and looks like it&#x27;s the real button on my jeans.</li>
            <li>My Jeans, which i bought a while back, had a button drop off  and because the hole got bigger with my efforts to fix it, I was sadden to lose these perfect pair of jeans.</li>
            <li>They stay put, but also quickly release, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>pants were fitting a bit snugger than normal, and my girlfriend mentioned this button.</li>
            <li>They do a really great job of adding a waist to today&#x27;s pants designed to slide down your hips.</li>
            <li>It is better than buying new pants for a growing waist.</li>
            <li>I thought they were well worth the money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new pair of pants every time I lost a few more pounds &#x3D; great value.</li>
            <li>It really makes it easier to have pants that fit.</li>
            <li>i think it is worth the money...</li>
            <li>and it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bristols6 sent another pair out right away.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have my jeans taken in since they never seem to look right</li>
            <li>The post goes right through the denim easily, the clip on the back is secure, and it closes just right.  </li>
            <li>Make your wardrobe fit and not have to buy new.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Works fine so far.  </li>
            <li>I had quite the opposite experience - I love the Adjust-A-Button.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time after Thanksgiving, and it worked like a charm....</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t even tell it wasn&#x27;t the real thing when she buttoned the pants!</li>
            <li>They are durable, and look exactly like denim buttons</li>
            <li>You can buy this exact item (no-sew, snap-on button) at any sewing store for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>Now I need some in different colors and styles to be able to use with my dress pants and skirts.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this because the button came off of my favorite pair or jeans</li>
            <li>They work like a charm I would totally recommend the buttons:)</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any real problems!</li>
            <li>Yes, it looks like a tie tack as others have said, but these things really work!  </li>
            <li>I lost about 10 lbs and these buttons are exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more packages of the ones you see pictured, as well as the ones that come in several colors for my hubby&#x27;s slacks.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, they could make the back clasp more rounded so the edge isn&#x27;t so severe.</li>
            <li>Makes your pants fit weather too big or to small this button works great.</li>
            <li>The nice thing with the ease of use is when your jeans start to \\&quot;give\\&quot; a little more throughout the day , all you have to do is move the button extender which is a 2 second task.  </li>
            <li>They stay on tight and I really love that I can move them around to tighten or loosen my pants!</li>
            <li>They are easy to push through the denim and the back clasp stays on well.</li>
            <li>But now, because it&#x27;s reusable and so easy to use, I can regularly wear shorts and jeans that were falling off of me.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use, and I can wear my jeans without having to constantly adjust them.</li>
            <li>I hope I would be able to use them often after I loose weight.</li>
            <li>the back stayed on just fine, and didn&#x27;t poke or prod.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the price was high compare to others</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Work really well at letting my jean out and giving me some breathing room.</li>
            <li>you can see the real one when you extend the jeans.</li>
            <li>Just pop it on and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>These buttons work really well on my jeans.  </li>
            <li>These feel like metal and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The spring loaded back is secure, yet east to remove, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It was to big and bulky to be comfortable on skinny jeans.</li>
            <li>Plus they ship the button in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Pants which fit in the thighs are always too big in the waist</li>
            <li>This button does adjust the pants as much as an inch.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper and a permanent solution.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for replacing/repositioning button on jeans.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>This does work very well</li>
            <li>rather it be straight.</li>
            <li>WORK BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>Works great if you have slacks, jeans or  shorts that are either too big or too small.</li>
            <li>I have bought others that are less expensive and don&#x27;t work (Perfect fit).</li>
            <li>The pin I was able to use has merit, but not really worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>This is very useful for small weight changes in the waist area instead of removing the original button.</li>
            <li>I would not make a waistband tight, however, as the part that ends up on the inside of the pants would not be very comfortable over the course of a day.</li>
            <li>Much easier than the hassle of heading to the tailor in hopes that they have the supplies &amp; equipment to put on a new one.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it better than having jeans too tight around the waist, though.</li>
            <li>They work great and it really helps my daughter who is very thin and needs the waist in her jeans adjusted.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you need a fix.</li>
            <li>but this is a very quick and easy way to fix a pant that is too big or perhaps even too small.</li>
            <li>which I use these buttons for till I can close them on the normal button.</li>
            <li>I have had similar products before but they just did not work right - always bending, coming undone, or even breaking.</li>
            <li>Instead of purchasing new clothing, this item has allowed me to continue to wear trousers that would otherwise have been donated to Goodwill.</li>
            <li>This button can sometimes let me skip wearing a belt, not usually a possibility for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it today for the first time, had to move it as the jeans material \\&quot;gave\\&quot; and I have totally forgotten</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t stick out so far into peoples&#x27; skin!</li>
            <li>Also, after I had each baby I was able to get back into my regular jeans earlier by using these buttons.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have a pair around for those situations when the jeans are a bit loose or tight.  </li>
            <li>No sewing, waiting, or tailor...completely fixed.</li>
            <li>These buttons really help for us girls who have the problem with the gap in the back of the pants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two sets so far.</li>
            <li>But she is slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Probably will work on most thick materials..  </li>
            <li>I also do not half to worry that I cannot get the backing off too.  </li>
            <li>One was easy to remove the pin back and the other my husband couldn&#x27;t even get the back off the pin.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work for making minor adjustments in the waist of a pair of jeans (or other heavy fabric pants), it would work great for those same type of pants that the button breaks.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to buy new jeans until I can lose the extra 5 pounds from the holidays!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately/Fortunately I&#x27;ve lost enough weight that I&#x27;ve had to buy new pants.</li>
            <li>The price may seem a little high, but it&#x27;s certainly easier and cheaper than getting your jeans altered.  </li>
            <li>The back of the button sticks out to far and is too sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After initially receiving a defective shipment fulfilled by Amazon, Bristols 6 contacted me directly and replaced the defective shipment at no charge.</li>
            <li>I could barely feel them against my skin</li>
            <li>I thought they were kind of expensive</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem if my waistline wasn&#x27;t too tight, but then again if it wasn&#x27;t too tight, then I wouldn&#x27;t need this in the first place!</li>
            <li>They work great but are a little difficult to take off and on.  </li>
            <li>These look much nicer than the other similar options.  </li>
            <li>Her jeans were actually a little bigger, so she used the button to take them in a little bit by putting it on the right side of the real button.</li>
            <li>The *only* reason they are four stars instead of five is due to the concept, not this particular brand.</li>

            <li> They stay put and successfully tighten my waistband</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to use and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to save your favorite pair of jeans!</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> but this brand did not work good....  </li>
            <li> could see this working good if your button broke while at work or away from home, and you couldn&#x27;t change your jeans at that time.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li> They made the shorts fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Convenient, good idea.  </li>
            <li> They have excellent customer service and really just want to see their customers happy.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I foresee many uses for this great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great temporary solution though, or I would use them if I had a pair of favorite jeans that I just couldn&#x27;t bear to let go of.</li>
            <li> I am buying some more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> This is a great and easy replacement for a lost button,especially if you can&#x27;t sew like me.</li>
            <li> They look nice, as well, but we haven&#x27;t tried them yet (more to come!).</li>
            <li> This brand is amazing</li>
            <li> The one that works is nice.</li>
            <li> This is truly Awesome, I love to give it  4.75/5( -.25 for expense) but totally worth it</li>
            <li> are popular brand named jeans.)</li>
            <li> I really liked these.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customer service at Bristols 6 is excellent and their product appears to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, works good for the purpose</li>
            <li> When i got the button, it took no space at all, fit well and the jeans feel so good.</li>
            <li> had to return for a refund which was a smooth transaction but looked like a good product.</li>
            <li> The backing seems to lock on securely which is good.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly easy to use...and look just like jeans buttons!</li>
            <li> These tie tack buttons are very well made and make every pair of lants fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviewers have covered what needs to be said about this item.</li>
            <li> i just love them.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> Tailoring the pants works better, but jeans are a lot of layers to try to sew through.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this.  </li>
            <li> Glad two buttons come in the pack.  </li>
            <li> Had a favorite pair of jeans that lost their button and</li>
            <li> Love these buttons.</li>
            <li> They work well, and look authentic.  </li>
            <li> and I love that you get two.</li>
            <li> They were not noticeable to anyone else since they sit inside the pants for the most part.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They just need a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Good customer service too as the factory forgot to include the backs on the set I first received.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, strong and stylish.  </li>
            <li> Sweet idea!</li>
            <li> I guess it would also be good to use when I start working out for my new year&#x27;s resolution....keeping my jeans on me when they (hopefully!)</li>
            <li> They are easy for me to push thru the material and hold well.  </li>
            <li> These metal buttons are easy to apply and have solved the problem for me.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use product that performs in the manner it was intended.  </li>
            <li> This way I can tighten or loosen my waist band easily as needed.</li>
            <li> This item is easy to put in , easy to take off and does the job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use,</li>
            <li> EASY ON AND OFF.</li>
            <li> I thought this product works just fine</li>
            <li> I suppose if you leave it on permanently it would be fine</li>
            <li> Stayed on fine, was comfortable too.</li>
            <li> baggy, tight or just a perfect fit</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with the waistline fit of pants as well as gaining and losing weight.</li>
            <li> I had lost some weight and none of my jeans fit anymore.  </li>
            <li> ITS FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I got CHEAP shorts</li>
            <li> I thought I would want to remove the original button on my jeans, but they are perfectly comfortable with both buttons.</li>
            <li> These are a quick and easy fix for jeans that could use an inch or two of tightening.  </li>
            <li> Super duper easy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for me though!</li>
            <li> No one notices these are not the original buttons.  </li>
            <li> If you are expanding the waist, you can&#x27;t tuck or both this and original button are seen.</li>
            <li> They look like original jean buttons and do not ruin pants.</li>
            <li> Put one of these on a pair of jeans which had lost a button...super fast and easy fix!  </li>
            <li> These work - even as a plus sized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in between sizes right now, and instead of buying more pants that won&#x27;t fit right, I got these.</li>
            <li> $15 may sound like a lot for \\&quot;buttons\\&quot; but when I think of how much money it saves on pants, it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> cant say enough Good stuff about this item.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought and looks like it&#x27;s the real button on my jeans.</li>
            <li> My Jeans, which i bought a while back, had a button drop off  and because the hole got bigger with my efforts to fix it, I was sadden to lose these perfect pair of jeans.</li>
            <li> They stay put, but also quickly release, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> pants were fitting a bit snugger than normal, and my girlfriend mentioned this button.</li>
            <li> They do a really great job of adding a waist to today&#x27;s pants designed to slide down your hips.</li>
            <li> It is better than buying new pants for a growing waist.</li>
            <li> I thought they were well worth the money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new pair of pants every time I lost a few more pounds &#x3D; great value.</li>
            <li> It really makes it easier to have pants that fit.</li>
            <li> i think it is worth the money...</li>
            <li> and it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bristols6 sent another pair out right away.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have my jeans taken in since they never seem to look right</li>
            <li> The post goes right through the denim easily, the clip on the back is secure, and it closes just right.  </li>
            <li> Make your wardrobe fit and not have to buy new.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Works fine so far.  </li>
            <li> I had quite the opposite experience - I love the Adjust-A-Button.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time after Thanksgiving, and it worked like a charm....</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even tell it wasn&#x27;t the real thing when she buttoned the pants!</li>
            <li> They are durable, and look exactly like denim buttons</li>
            <li> You can buy this exact item (no-sew, snap-on button) at any sewing store for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> Now I need some in different colors and styles to be able to use with my dress pants and skirts.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this because the button came off of my favorite pair or jeans</li>
            <li> They work like a charm I would totally recommend the buttons:)</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any real problems!</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks like a tie tack as others have said, but these things really work!  </li>
            <li> I lost about 10 lbs and these buttons are exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more packages of the ones you see pictured, as well as the ones that come in several colors for my hubby&#x27;s slacks.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, they could make the back clasp more rounded so the edge isn&#x27;t so severe.</li>
            <li> Makes your pants fit weather too big or to small this button works great.</li>
            <li> The nice thing with the ease of use is when your jeans start to \\&quot;give\\&quot; a little more throughout the day , all you have to do is move the button extender which is a 2 second task.  </li>
            <li> They stay on tight and I really love that I can move them around to tighten or loosen my pants!</li>
            <li> They are easy to push through the denim and the back clasp stays on well.</li>
            <li> But now, because it&#x27;s reusable and so easy to use, I can regularly wear shorts and jeans that were falling off of me.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, and I can wear my jeans without having to constantly adjust them.</li>
            <li> I hope I would be able to use them often after I loose weight.</li>
            <li> the back stayed on just fine, and didn&#x27;t poke or prod.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the price was high compare to others</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Work really well at letting my jean out and giving me some breathing room.</li>
            <li> you can see the real one when you extend the jeans.</li>
            <li> Just pop it on and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> These buttons work really well on my jeans.  </li>
            <li> These feel like metal and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The spring loaded back is secure, yet east to remove, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It was to big and bulky to be comfortable on skinny jeans.</li>
            <li> Plus they ship the button in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Pants which fit in the thighs are always too big in the waist</li>
            <li> This button does adjust the pants as much as an inch.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper and a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for replacing/repositioning button on jeans.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> This does work very well</li>
            <li> rather it be straight.</li>
            <li> WORK BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have slacks, jeans or  shorts that are either too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I have bought others that are less expensive and don&#x27;t work (Perfect fit).</li>
            <li> The pin I was able to use has merit, but not really worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> This is very useful for small weight changes in the waist area instead of removing the original button.</li>
            <li> I would not make a waistband tight, however, as the part that ends up on the inside of the pants would not be very comfortable over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> Much easier than the hassle of heading to the tailor in hopes that they have the supplies &amp; equipment to put on a new one.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it better than having jeans too tight around the waist, though.</li>
            <li> They work great and it really helps my daughter who is very thin and needs the waist in her jeans adjusted.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you need a fix.</li>
            <li> but this is a very quick and easy way to fix a pant that is too big or perhaps even too small.</li>
            <li> which I use these buttons for till I can close them on the normal button.</li>
            <li> I have had similar products before but they just did not work right - always bending, coming undone, or even breaking.</li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing new clothing, this item has allowed me to continue to wear trousers that would otherwise have been donated to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> This button can sometimes let me skip wearing a belt, not usually a possibility for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it today for the first time, had to move it as the jeans material \\&quot;gave\\&quot; and I have totally forgotten</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t stick out so far into peoples&#x27; skin!</li>
            <li> Also, after I had each baby I was able to get back into my regular jeans earlier by using these buttons.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have a pair around for those situations when the jeans are a bit loose or tight.  </li>
            <li> No sewing, waiting, or tailor...completely fixed.</li>
            <li> These buttons really help for us girls who have the problem with the gap in the back of the pants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two sets so far.</li>
            <li> But she is slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Probably will work on most thick materials..  </li>
            <li> I also do not half to worry that I cannot get the backing off too.  </li>
            <li> One was easy to remove the pin back and the other my husband couldn&#x27;t even get the back off the pin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work for making minor adjustments in the waist of a pair of jeans (or other heavy fabric pants), it would work great for those same type of pants that the button breaks.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to buy new jeans until I can lose the extra 5 pounds from the holidays!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately/Fortunately I&#x27;ve lost enough weight that I&#x27;ve had to buy new pants.</li>
            <li> The price may seem a little high, but it&#x27;s certainly easier and cheaper than getting your jeans altered.  </li>
            <li> The back of the button sticks out to far and is too sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After initially receiving a defective shipment fulfilled by Amazon, Bristols 6 contacted me directly and replaced the defective shipment at no charge.</li>
            <li> I could barely feel them against my skin</li>
            <li> I thought they were kind of expensive</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem if my waistline wasn&#x27;t too tight, but then again if it wasn&#x27;t too tight, then I wouldn&#x27;t need this in the first place!</li>
            <li> They work great but are a little difficult to take off and on.  </li>
            <li> These look much nicer than the other similar options.  </li>
            <li> Her jeans were actually a little bigger, so she used the button to take them in a little bit by putting it on the right side of the real button.</li>
            <li> The *only* reason they are four stars instead of five is due to the concept, not this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I thought they were a little high priced when I purchased them, but after seeing the quality and how they immediately became indispensible,</li>
            <li> but they seem to be made well and will hopefully last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I lost about 50 pounds and jeans could be expensive these days but with the adjustable button it makes my life a lot easier, easy to put on and take off</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product.</li>
            <li> Looked for a solution for my jean button for a long time till my wife saw these.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;reusable factor&amp;#34; is definitely a plus, and they haven&#x27;t let me down after using them in several garments.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other buttons that are similar to these</li>
            <li> But after using this I can&#x27;t imagine using this button all day because of the pain and irritation it caused due to the back of the button sticking out and rubbing against my waist.</li>
            <li> I can make the waist either a little smaller or larger.</li>
            <li> So for $16, no alterations and no new jeans.</li>
            <li> If you have loose pants that have a button (like jeans) buy this now.</li>
            <li> and I inevitably wind up pulling them up after bending over or sitting down.  </li>
            <li> My pants are bigger for my hips but the pants gape at the back because I have a small waist.</li>
            <li> My only dislike is if you have to pull them really tight, it can leave a hole where the pin goes.</li>
            <li> My jeans are a little too big at the waist.</li>
            <li> When I lose a little weight, I take them in further.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I have with them is that the pointy post that goes through the jeans bends a little over time.  </li>
            <li> These seemed like a great idea, but the execution is terrible.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the back of the adjuster pokes a bit into my belly if I haven&#x27;t tucked in a shirt.</li>
            <li> I really need something like this, but unfortunately there is a metal piece on the back that digs into my waist and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with my jeans gapping in the back but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Adjust-A-Button to fix a pair of jeans that had a missing button.</li>
            <li> Be careful though</li>
            <li> This items is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I spent about $15 on a package of just two button pins.</li>
            <li> The idea of just adding another button isn&#x27;t a long term solution because it just feels slightly off.</li>
            <li> the clasp that goes on the inside of the jeans is big, obviously much bigger than a regular button since it&#x27;s a mechanical clasp, so it can be uncomfortable, especially with tight jeans.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that these would pop off due to other reviews, but I&#x27;ve found that these buttons lie flat against my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not visible to other people, just distracting to me.</li>
            <li> Other than that one flaw I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Got these for jeans but use them all the time for other pants.  </li>
            <li> just in case the pants I&#x27;m wearing become too loose or too tight during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes a little strange because the weight of my jeans drag down the unused button making them dip a little in the front, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> No more, because the zipper starts to overlap itself and then the pants don&#x27;t lie flat in front.  </li>
            <li> I hate belts and love these.</li>
            <li> If your waist line goes up and down like mine</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that they are really deep, much deeper than a normal denim button, meaning that there is a small metal disc stabbing me in the abdomen all day.  </li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re not very strong.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear my jeans overly tight but even so, the pin bent after less than a day&#x27;s wear.  </li>
            <li> Small minus</li>
            <li> I tried every single pant extender on the market - the elastic loop, the hard plastic loop,the extender with the fabric</li>
            <li> I have a lot of expensive designer jeans, and now i dont have to purchase any new ones, and it takes the 1-2 inches off that I need.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe this little gem of a fix.....</li>
            <li> As for me, I had to use it to take out my jeans a little bit...</li>
            <li> but what I don&#x27;t like is that when installed, the back of the button on the inside is rubbing or even piercing into/against your waist and your pants are already too tight around the waistline so this makes it worse.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I managed to lose a few of them and have had to re-order, because I have found I can&#x27;t leave home without one in my pocket,</li>
            <li> I wear a smaller pant size at my waist than at my behind.  </li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t like is that the fastener of this button sticks out in back and is just slightly irritating.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but at least there were two in the package.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I have put on a few lbs lately....</li>
            <li> Since I always wear a belt and usually a pull-over shirt, or just un-tucked, no one can see that I have one of these buttons on.  </li>
            <li> --Over time the pin makes a small hole in the fabric</li>
            <li> I brought a pair of jeans, that fix but small in the waist</li>
            <li> i was worried that the shank on these things would be too long, making them uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realizing how stupid I sound for saying that, but I&#x27;m a lazy man and Amazon Prime is my guilty pleasure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing some weight lately</li>
            <li> Wel, No More!</li>
            <li> These work slick!  </li>
            <li> The spring to remove that item is like pulling King Arthur&#x27;s sword out of the stone - next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> I do think they are a little expensive, $15 for 2.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this useless item.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, that is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> seriously, my prayers are answered!</li>
            <li> But it does poke me in the tummy a little :-(  </li>
            <li> but just too expensive for just 2 buttons.</li>
            <li> pokes belly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and they were expensive.  </li>
            <li> And the inside piece does NOT irritate or make it uncomfortable to use this item.</li>
            <li> This is an over priced and useless item for extending the waist size.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it was horribly uncomfortable having a 1/4&amp;#34; brad pushing into my stomach all day.</li>
            <li> depressing, i know.</li>
            <li> Had a button pop off after just 2 washes on a very expensive pair of jeans.</li>
            <li> The cheaper ones have backs that are nearly impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> After a while, I had to quit wearing my jeans because my skin got so irritated and painful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brand of adjust a button, I have had these types of adjustable buttons before and never had a problem.....</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> annoying:  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> These work great! They are easy to push through the denim and the back clasp stays on well. I have always had trouble with my jeans gapping in the back but not anymore. I wish I had found these  years ago!</li>
            <li> I had quite the opposite experience - I love the Adjust-A-Button. I used it for the first time after Thanksgiving, and it worked like a charm....the back stayed on just fine, and didn&#x27;t poke or prod. i think it is worth the money...especially since you get 2 of them. Not that I want to make a habit of overeating, but if I do, I can let the waist out without letting it all hang out. Haha. I guess it would also be good to use when I start working out for my new year&#x27;s resolution....keeping my jeans on me when they (hopefully!) start getting too big!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other buttons that are similar to these but nothing comes close to how well these work for jeans.  very simple to use and no worries at all...I do not have to worry that the backing will fall off...I also do not half to worry that I cannot get the backing off too.  I like changing styles and this lets me do it...baggy, tight or just a perfect fit; this allows me to do it.  At first I thought the price was high compare to others but once I tried it I see why...they exceeded expectations.  I am buying some more!</li>
            <li> helps on those shrinking jeans day&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I thought this product works just fine but just too expensive for just 2 buttons.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I have put on a few lbs lately....pants were fitting a bit snugger than normal, and my girlfriend mentioned this button. Work really well at letting my jean out and giving me some breathing room. Stayed on fine, was comfortable too.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe this little gem of a fix.....seriously, my prayers are answered! I bought this for the holidays as a hostess gift for my sister-in-law and myself...she just had a baby, and the holidays aren&#x27;t helping her drop the weight either! But she is slowly but surely. The buttons work like a pin, and you just poke through your jeans and fasten the back. Voila! Her jeans were actually a little bigger, so she used the button to take them in a little bit by putting it on the right side of the real button. Couldn&#x27;t even tell it wasn&#x27;t the real thing when she buttoned the pants! As for me, I had to use it to take out my jeans a little bit...depressing, i know. Anyways, it held well. Just had to keep my shirt over the button b/c you can see the real one when you extend the jeans. Nice that you get 2!</li>
            <li> Only one of the two buttons I received actually locks.  Considering the price, that is a little disappointing.  The one that works is nice.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Adjust-A-Button to fix a pair of jeans that had a missing button. No sewing, waiting, or tailor...completely fixed. But now, because it&#x27;s reusable and so easy to use, I can regularly wear shorts and jeans that were falling off of me. My husband also LOVES this button and uses it regularly as well.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great price, easy to use and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The waist is always too big on my jeans and shorts.  This works terrific to snug them up enough so that I don&#x27;t have to wear a belt.  I thought they were kind of expensive but they seem to be made well and will hopefully last a long time.  Wish I had discovered these sooner.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the package, I realized it was like a tie tack or a pierced earring. When I put it in my jeans, it popped out immediately. Worthless.</li>
            <li> These buttons do their job! I love them! They are durable enough for denim and stay put all day! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Save money save time. Makes your pants fit weather too big or to small this button works great. Make your wardrobe fit and not have to buy new. Love it.</li>
            <li> These are a quick and easy fix for jeans that could use an inch or two of tightening.  The technology is so simple: it&#x27;s just like a tie pin in the shape of a button.  Just pop it on and you&#x27;re ready to go.  The price may seem a little high, but it&#x27;s certainly easier and cheaper than getting your jeans altered.  I thought I would want to remove the original button on my jeans, but they are perfectly comfortable with both buttons.</li>
            <li> If your waist line goes up and down like mine these are for you!  They are durable, and look exactly like denim buttons</li>
            <li> This product delivers as promised.  Now I don&#x27;t have to buy new jeans until I can lose the extra 5 pounds from the holidays!  Yeaaaaaa!!!</li>
            <li> I hate belts and love these.</li>
            <li> You can buy this exact item (no-sew, snap-on button) at any sewing store for a couple bucks. This is a rip off!</li>
            <li> These buttons really help for us girls who have the problem with the gap in the back of the pants. My only dislike is if you have to pull them really tight, it can leave a hole where the pin goes. Totally worth it for me though!</li>
            <li> It does as it says. I love them. I hope I would be able to use them often after I loose weight.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviewers have covered what needs to be said about this item. This is truly Awesome, I love to give it  4.75/5( -.25 for expense) but totally worth it tho. My Jeans, which i bought a while back, had a button drop off  and because the hole got bigger with my efforts to fix it, I was sadden to lose these perfect pair of jeans. When i got the button, it took no space at all, fit well and the jeans feel so good. I am impressed.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brand of adjust a button, I have had these types of adjustable buttons before and never had a problem.....but this brand did not work good....  the button just kept popping off.</li>
            <li> this is a great invention for those with flutuating waist sizes, it works so well and it is worth the price.  buy one and wear those skinny jeans again</li>
            <li> Works perfect, well worth the money. If you have loose pants that have a button (like jeans) buy this now.</li>
            <li> These things have cured a life-long problem with my jeans.  They are absolutely great.  My husband uses too.  No one notices these are not the original buttons.  Be careful though, you forget to take them off and put them in the washer &amp; dryer and you will ruin them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product. I have always had problems with the waistline fit of pants as well as gaining and losing weight. I was always having to sew darts in my jeans and then let them out again. Wel, No More! These tie tack buttons are very well made and make every pair of lants fit perfectly.  i just love them. I would definitely recommend them to everyone. I thought they were a little high priced when I purchased them, but after seeing the quality and how they immediately became indispensible, I they they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They work great and it really helps my daughter who is very thin and needs the waist in her jeans adjusted.  I do think they are a little expensive, $15 for 2.</li>
            <li> Now I need some in different colors and styles to be able to use with my dress pants and skirts.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;reusable factor&amp;#34; is definitely a plus, and they haven&#x27;t let me down after using them in several garments.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, works good for the purpose but what I don&#x27;t like is that when installed, the back of the button on the inside is rubbing or even piercing into/against your waist and your pants are already too tight around the waistline so this makes it worse. After a while, I had to quit wearing my jeans because my skin got so irritated and painful. The back of the button sticks out to far and is too sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this working good if your button broke while at work or away from home, and you couldn&#x27;t change your jeans at that time. But after using this I can&#x27;t imagine using this button all day because of the pain and irritation it caused due to the back of the button sticking out and rubbing against my waist. It wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem if my waistline wasn&#x27;t too tight, but then again if it wasn&#x27;t too tight, then I wouldn&#x27;t need this in the first place!</li>
            <li> These buttons work really well on my jeans.  Probably will work on most thick materials..  Won&#x27;t slip off either.  Love them.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> These work great!! They actually stay attached. I have run my pants through the washer and dryer several times, and they are still in tact.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly.  The post goes right through the denim easily, the clip on the back is secure, and it closes just right.  Gives me just the extra room I need.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> These work great on my jeans, allow me to extend the waist another inch or so.  Since I always wear a belt and usually a pull-over shirt, or just un-tucked, no one can see that I have one of these buttons on.  They are easy for me to push thru the material and hold well.  I&#x27;ve purchased two sets so far.</li>
            <li> Looked for a solution for my jean button for a long time till my wife saw these. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing some weight lately and I bought some &amp;#34;goal jeans&amp;#34; which I use these buttons for till I can close them on the normal button. They&#x27;re comfy and they saty in place!</li>
            <li> This items is not what I expected.  It is plastic and has to be removed with washing, I thought it was metal. A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this because the button came off of my favorite pair or jeans but I use the second button on different pants to make them tighter or looser. It works well.</li>
            <li> i use these on 3 different pairs of jeans.  they work great and saved me from having to throw out otherwise perfectly good jeans!</li>
            <li> I am using the Adjust a button and cant get it to stay on can anyone give me some tips on how to use these things!!!</li>
            <li> My jeans are a little too big at the waist. These metal buttons are easy to apply and have solved the problem for me.</li>
            <li> i was worried that the shank on these things would be too long, making them uncomfortable. But they worked perfectly! I actually used mine to replace a button that fell out of my Eddie Bauer jeans. I didn&#x27;t want to take them back, because I had already hemmed them.  This fit the bill perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have slacks, jeans or  shorts that are either too big or too small. I gained weight after an operation and used  these to continue wearing my regular size. Now I am losing weight and am using these between sizes. If used to make pants tighter, you can tuck your shirt in. If you are expanding the waist, you can&#x27;t tuck or both this and original button are seen. These feel like metal and are very sturdy. Somehow, I managed to lose a few of them and have had to re-order, because I have found I can&#x27;t leave home without one in my pocket, just in case the pants I&#x27;m wearing become too loose or too tight during the day. The spring loaded back is secure, yet east to remove, once you get the hang of it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work...but by the looks of it...it totally works. Since the button fell of my Miss Me jean I couldn&#x27;t wear it for weeks so I ordered the buttons and I gotta say they are the best ever! They work like a charm I would totally recommend the buttons:)</li>
            <li> had to return for a refund which was a smooth transaction but looked like a good product. I had found something else that worked.</li>
            <li> It was to big and bulky to be comfortable on skinny jeans.</li>
            <li> I got this button because the button on my jeans broke. This is a great way to save your favorite pair of jeans! Plus they ship the button in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I actually use these for a couple of pairs of shorts that I have that, after wearing for a bit, stretch out.  With these, I can re-sinch them up to my liking.</li>
            <li> I lost about 50 pounds and jeans could be expensive these days but with the adjustable button it makes my life a lot easier, easy to put on and take off</li>
            <li> Pants which fit in the thighs are always too big in the waist and I inevitably wind up pulling them up after bending over or sitting down.  Adjust-A-Button has solved that problem for me! Good customer service too as the factory forgot to include the backs on the set I first received.  Bristols6 sent another pair out right away.  I foresee many uses for this great product.</li>
            <li> pokes belly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a great and easy replacement for a lost button,especially if you can&#x27;t sew like me.</li>
            <li> This button does adjust the pants.  I wear a smaller pant size at my waist than at my behind.  I use this to take the pants in an inch.  Tailoring the pants works better, but jeans are a lot of layers to try to sew through.  This button does adjust the pants as much as an inch.  No more, because the zipper starts to overlap itself and then the pants don&#x27;t lie flat in front.  This button can sometimes let me skip wearing a belt, not usually a possibility for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the fastener of this button sticks out in back and is just slightly irritating.  It&#x27;s not visible to other people, just distracting to me.</li>
            <li> Sweet idea! But it does poke me in the tummy a little :-(  Sometimes it better than having jeans too tight around the waist, though.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a great idea, but the execution is terrible. These are garbage. I spent about $15 on a package of just two button pins. One was easy to remove the pin back and the other my husband couldn&#x27;t even get the back off the pin. The pin I was able to use has merit, but not really worth the price tag. It wouldn&#x27;t hold up if you wanted to tighten your jeans. My opinion is to save your money and use a needle and thread. It is much cheaper and a permanent solution. Garbage!</li>
            <li> I use this button to elliminate the gap at the back of my jeans. My pants are bigger for my hips but the pants gape at the back because I have a small waist. My husband uses the button for the opposite reason. He uses the button to make his pants waist larger. Small minus--Over time the pin makes a small hole in the fabric but it does not show. It is better than buying new pants for a growing waist.</li>
            <li> These work slick!  They stay put, but also quickly release, just as advertised.  Nice to have a pair around for those situations when the jeans are a bit loose or tight.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Worked very well for replacing/repositioning button on jeans.  This is very useful for small weight changes in the waist area instead of removing the original button.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of a problem but it was handled immediately to my satisfaction. The button looks very good but it does seem to have a bit of a manufacturing problem but it does work.</li>
            <li> Great idea and works well.  Pays for themselves.  These look much nicer than the other similar options.  Probably a must have item for maternity.</li>
            <li> These work great! I just wish they weren&#x27;t quite so expensive, like some of the competitor brands, but in the end they work much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this.  I bought a pair of pants that are too big in the waist and found this product online at Amazon.  It works like a charm.  Glad two buttons come in the pack.  This is so easy to use, and I can wear my jeans without having to constantly adjust them.</li>
            <li> Super duper easy. Great price. Had a button pop off after just 2 washes on a very expensive pair of jeans. This was a life saver since the price I got them at was a steal. Highly recommend if you need a fix.</li>
            <li> Had a favorite pair of jeans that lost their button and this allowed me to keep them without having to try to sew it back on.  I&#x27;m realizing how stupid I sound for saying that, but I&#x27;m a lazy man and Amazon Prime is my guilty pleasure.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use product that performs in the manner it was intended.  Instead of purchasing new clothing, this item has allowed me to continue to wear trousers that would otherwise have been donated to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> These buttons work well to extend the waistband on jeans. My only complaint is that the back of the adjuster pokes a bit into my belly if I haven&#x27;t tucked in a shirt. If the backing could be made wider it may solve this problem.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that these would pop off due to other reviews, but I&#x27;ve found that these buttons lie flat against my skin and I don&#x27;t even notice they are on. I have been using them to make my jeans tighter as I have lost some weight and they do the job! It&#x27;s sometimes a little strange because the weight of my jeans drag down the unused button making them dip a little in the front, if that makes sense. But overall they are a life-saver for all of my jeans and I haven&#x27;t had any real problems!</li>
            <li> These are finer quality than the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; brand.  They do a really great job of adding a waist to today&#x27;s pants designed to slide down your hips.</li>
            <li> Love these buttons. They look like original jean buttons and do not ruin pants. Would definitely recommend and buy from Bristol 6, inc. again. They have excellent customer service and really just want to see their customers happy. Thank you Bristols 6, inc.</li>
            <li> This buttons are great.  They work well, and look authentic.  I have been losing weight and it helps a lot to skip a jean size, and it has saved me money.</li>
            <li> Put one of these on a pair of jeans which had lost a button...super fast and easy fix!  They stay on tight and I really love that I can move them around to tighten or loosen my pants!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution to waistband adjustment.  I don&#x27;t like to wear a belt with my jeans and pants because it causes a bulge.  This way I can tighten or loosen my waist band easily as needed.</li>
            <li> I had lost some weight and none of my jeans fit anymore.  I didn&#x27;t want to have my jeans taken in since they never seem to look right and they were expensive.  After searching I found these buttons and they work great and I love that you get two.</li>
            <li> They work great!  Been using them for years</li>
            <li> They work great! I use them to make my pants smaller and I use them every weekday for work and they&#x27;re still holding up. :D</li>
            <li> The button work well but I have an issue with the price of a pair of them. You would expect them to be gold and last forever at this cost.</li>
            <li> This is well made, only thing is it&#x27;s used to tighten jeans but not for expanding. Other than that one flaw I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works fine so far.  A little pricey, but at least there were two in the package.</li>
            <li> I tried every single pant extender on the market - the elastic loop, the hard plastic loop,the extender with the fabric that either buttons or hooks onto your existing pants button or hook.  Dont waist ( pun intended) your time or $$ on any of those.  THESE ARE THE BOMB- Just Fantastic  !!!  I bought a set of these with a similar principal in mind at a local discount store ( it is a As Seen on TV item) but returned those the next week. The spring to remove that item is like pulling King Arthur&#x27;s sword out of the stone - next to impossible.  This item is easy to put in , easy to take off and does the job. The nice thing with the ease of use is when your jeans start to \\&quot;give\\&quot; a little more throughout the day , all you have to do is move the button extender which is a 2 second task.  And the inside piece does NOT irritate or make it uncomfortable to use this item. I have used it today for the first time, had to move it as the jeans material \\&quot;gave\\&quot; and I have totally forgotten I have it on.  ITS FANTASTIC.  Now I can quite tossing my $$ away on buying a pair of jeans I like in two different sizes. My next step before I used this item was to buy the granny elastic waist jeans.  Now I wont have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;I cant say enough Good stuff about this item. I wish I had discovered this sooner.  FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks like a tie tack as others have said, but these things really work!  I have had similar products before but they just did not work right - always bending, coming undone, or even breaking. These work - even as a plus sized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in between sizes right now, and instead of buying more pants that won&#x27;t fit right, I got these. I can make the larger pants snugger, and the tighter pants looser. $15 may sound like a lot for \\&quot;buttons\\&quot; but when I think of how much money it saves on pants, it is more than worth it. I have ordered additional pairs.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect, just what I needed. I lost about 10 lbs and these buttons are exactly what i needed. I have a lot of expensive designer jeans, and now i dont have to purchase any new ones, and it takes the 1-2 inches off that I need. So for $16, no alterations and no new jeans. Love! I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I bought for MY jeans...my husband immediately swiped them! LOL! He&#x27;s lost a lot of weight and needed them, too! I just ordered two more packages of the ones you see pictured, as well as the ones that come in several colors for my hubby&#x27;s slacks. They look nice, as well, but we haven&#x27;t tried them yet (more to come!). These are amazingly easy to use...and look just like jeans buttons! I recommend them! You couldn&#x27;t ask for an easier fix!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift, never heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> Got these for jeans but use them all the time for other pants.  Jackets, sweaters.  Easy to use, strong and stylish.  Great, great product.  Will always have this on hand!</li>
            <li> After initially receiving a defective shipment fulfilled by Amazon, Bristols 6 contacted me directly and replaced the defective shipment at no charge. Customer service at Bristols 6 is excellent and their product appears to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> This item is used just like any type of &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; with a back.  Not only does it work for making minor adjustments in the waist of a pair of jeans (or other heavy fabric pants), it would work great for those same type of pants that the button breaks.  Much easier than the hassle of heading to the tailor in hopes that they have the supplies &amp; equipment to put on a new one.  I would not make a waistband tight, however, as the part that ends up on the inside of the pants would not be very comfortable over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> This does work very well I just wish it had been cheaper but this is a very quick and easy way to fix a pant that is too big or perhaps even too small.</li>
            <li> This is an over priced and useless item for extending the waist size. Doesnt pierce any of my denim jeans.(All are popular brand named jeans.) If it did in fact pierce them, there is still not enough room to move the button over.  Dont waste your money on this useless item.</li>
            <li> I really need something like this, but unfortunately there is a metal piece on the back that digs into my waist and irritates my skin. I called the company about this and the response I got was that I should put a tissue between it and my skin. Sounds like they should just redesign the clasp so it doesn&#x27;t stick out so far into peoples&#x27; skin! Alternatively, they could make the back clasp more rounded so the edge isn&#x27;t so severe.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought and looks like it&#x27;s the real button on my jeans. Love these!</li>
            <li> I really liked these. They felt sturdy. I could barely feel them against my skin and I was probably only imagining things because I knew they were there. They were not noticeable to anyone else since they sit inside the pants for the most part. I thought they were well worth the money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new pair of pants every time I lost a few more pounds &#x3D; great value. Unfortunately/Fortunately I&#x27;ve lost enough weight that I&#x27;ve had to buy new pants. The *only* reason they are four stars instead of five is due to the concept, not this particular brand. The idea of just adding another button isn&#x27;t a long term solution because it just feels slightly off. It&#x27;s a great temporary solution though, or I would use them if I had a pair of favorite jeans that I just couldn&#x27;t bear to let go of.</li>
            <li> I got this for my growing kids who sometimes need an extra inch overnight!  They work great but are a little difficult to take off and on.  I suppose if you leave it on permanently it would be fine but I just use them in a pinch before I got out to buy bigger pants.</li>
            <li> ...when losing weight.  i can&#x27;t speak to how it works for making pants bigger.  it&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t ruin my pants - have used on jeans and khakis - and looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought another well known brand and they all broke and or wouldnt come off once I used them. This brand is amazing and I can remove it very simple to transfer to another pair of jeans/ pants. I will definitely buy only this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> It works great!!! it and the service was excellent! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to tighten or loosen their jeans.</li>
            <li> yep, these do the job quite well.  They stay put and successfully tighten my waistband (I assume they would work equally well for loosening).  My only disappointment is that they are really deep, much deeper than a normal denim button, meaning that there is a small metal disc stabbing me in the abdomen all day.  I don&#x27;t really notice it too much, it definitely hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using them, but it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear my jeans overly tight but even so, the pin bent after less than a day&#x27;s wear.  Not to mention it was horribly uncomfortable having a 1/4&amp;#34; brad pushing into my stomach all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I got CHEAP shorts but they were too big.  These buttons work wonderfully!  They made the shorts fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I brought a pair of jeans, that fix but small in the waist, now they fix perfectly</li>
            <li> These buttons works as described. The backing seems to lock on securely which is good.</li>
            <li> These buttons are awesome!  I have been using them for years and they have saved me.  Depending on circumstances in my life, I adjust the button in or out.  When I lose a little weight, I take them in further.  It&#x27;s definitely a must if you want to extend the life of your wardrobe when losing weight.  Also, after I had each baby I was able to get back into my regular jeans earlier by using these buttons.  The only drawback I have with them is that the pointy post that goes through the jeans bends a little over time.  I can still use them with the post being bent but I&#x27;d rather it be straight.</li>
            <li> Great product but the part on the inside of your pants pokes and created a bruise.</li>
            <li> Convenient, good idea.  However, they&#x27;re not very strong.  After replacing a button on a pair of Big Star jeans, within 2 times of wearing them, the peg that pokes through the jeans bent. A lot.  It didn&#x27;t break, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also annoying:  the clasp that goes on the inside of the jeans is big, obviously much bigger than a regular button since it&#x27;s a mechanical clasp, so it can be uncomfortable, especially with tight jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just need a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, it works, and saved me a pair of jeans.</li>
            <li> WORK BETTER THAN EXPECTED. EASY ON AND OFF. STAYED ON FINE.WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN. HOPE I DO NOT HAVE TO.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have bought others that are less expensive and don&#x27;t work (Perfect fit). The cheaper ones have backs that are nearly impossible to remove. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a couple of months now and they still work great. I will be ordering more. My weight fluctuates so using this adjust-a-button I can make the waist either a little smaller or larger. It really makes it easier to have pants that fit.</li>
