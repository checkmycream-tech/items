    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best nose trimmer i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best of this style trimmer that I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Excellent service; great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent concept but the cutter bar doesn&#x27;t let the hairs in, so it skips/misses the hairs.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best of all I don’t have to monitor his progress.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best ones (Groom Mate Platinum XL and Panasonic ER-GN30-K) are both rotary models.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for eyebrows, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is perfectly designed.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly!</li>
            <li>That said, I think for perfectionists, the combo of the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 and a rotary trimmer would be ideal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have both on my team.  </li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Great eyebrow trim.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I haven’t gotten around to replacing it, so I was happy to be offered to opportunity to review this product, the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>It is perfectly designed and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>Just a great design, all around.</li>
            <li>; (that&#x27;s actually a good rating by me).  </li>
            <li>good quality</li>
            <li>Great value, nice finishing touch.</li>
            <li>He loved it</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a good job</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t have good motor control, but who has the time?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all in all a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall he recommends this trimmer as doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I loved it until a week ago.  </li>
            <li>Is a good value for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So for the first time ever I had the opportunity to try a nose/ear hair trimmer, the Phillips Norelco Nose Trimmer, model NT3355/60, and came away quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to wash</li>
            <li>Very effective, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This does not work well at all--simply does not cut effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li>Also, I wish it came with some kind of storage stand or bag.  </li>
            <li>Excellent value for the price, works really well.</li>
            <li>Really good and powerfull :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of time.... while I was trimming the blades started to warm up.  </li>
            <li>Nice product and value for money</li>
            <li>He tried this one and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>saw that he could also trim his eyebrows and he also liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing to rave about, would be much nice if it came with a rechargeable battery pack</li>
            <li>The whole thing is wonderfully self contained, with an ON/OFF switch and a battery opening.</li>
            <li>This one comes with an eyebrow trimmer which may be nice for some people.</li>
            <li>Nice nose trimmer...</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to do some manscaping again!</li>
            <li>Not the most effective trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great tool for in-between-barber-shop maintenance, and because it&#x27;s easy to use, does the job, and is pain free, even the most averse to manscaping will use it.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about a month; I changed the first battery after it died and it no longer works at all</li>
            <li>The Norelco has more exposed blade area which requires fewer passes.</li>
            <li>Seems to be more durable than what I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>The blades are somewhat obstructed by the orange housing (compared to competitors models), which means that you may need to work a bit more to get everything trimmed.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>Nose ok.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m OK with that for the price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>This works as well or better.</li>
            <li>With this trimmer; we’re able to maintain his nose, ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Sure there is a two year warranty but who keeps receipts for a $10 item.</li>
            <li>The more I tried to trim, the more I ended up just poking myself.  </li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>Which type is better?</li>
            <li>where most trimmers either hit skin or just don&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nose is much more comfortable now that I have cleared it out!</li>
            <li>Fully washable and can safely can be rinsed under the faucet</li>
            <li>A nice grip and fits comfortably in your hands</li>
            <li>I suspect they designed it this way because the trimmer is waterproof and an on-off switch might be more prone to leak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t work better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still glad I have this.</li>
            <li>It had the Philips Norelco NT8110 Nose and Ear Trimmer before and likes this one even better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>Rather than using the rotary top, it cuts along one side of the angled tip.</li>
            <li>top rotates, and this is how you turn it on/off as well as removing the top for battery installation.</li>
            <li>The vibrating blade can still nick you, so compared to the rotating ones it would require more care before putting it into your nose or ear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a nose or ear trimmer before and was worried that it would hurt but even more that I would cut myself up.  </li>
            <li>This works perfectly because hair definitely comes off, but there is no chance of you taking a huge chunk out of your eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>, the Norelco is superior because it is so much faster and more efficient.</li>
            <li>The straight slim edge effectively removes the offending hairs without a problem and the devise is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is not so good as you go deeper in the nostril with hairs sticking straight out.  </li>
            <li>I still like my Panasonic pointy type best but will probably use both as each do something the other doesn’t.</li>
            <li>A rotary head, like those used on some other trimmers, is best for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>The two attachments are easy to lose and the trimmer falls over fairly easily if stood on end.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painless and easy to use.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s so easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>This is an easy tool to use, both compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect- powerful, quiet and non-complicated.</li>
            <li>It has a lot more power and is easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li>It is relatively easy to use and for me also worked as a sideburn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He liked his older one better</li>
            <li>I also find this PN3300 to have good build quality and it comes with a free high quality AA battery (lithium disposable).  </li>
            <li>They do work fine once you get the one you wanted.  </li>
            <li>it works fine, no complains here.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he said that it did the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is great - quick, painless, reliable - my only gripe about the Panasonic is that the rounded tip is shorter that I would like in some cases which means I have to mow the lawn more often.  </li>
            <li>Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li>trimmer is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>100% comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to clean up easily.  </li>
            <li>It will fit in the ear canal if you have a hair problem there and can take attachments for eyebrow trimming.</li>
            <li>yeah, it&#x27;s another cheaply made product no one should buy.</li>
            <li>so which is good if you are prone to shoving things too far up your nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are good products made in China but price point items are typically not.</li>
            <li>My current go-to trimmer (for one year+) is the very popular Panasonic with a rounded tip.  </li>
            <li>As long as your expectations are not unrealistically high, you should be very happy with this ear and nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- it does clean work, but it comes with the price, see below</li>
            <li>It trims cleanly without any pulling.</li>
            <li>This requires a somewhat different technique to use (you have to rotate the trimmer inside your nose), but ends up being much more effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe that you could just rinse the trimmer under the faucet to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Passed this on right to my husband and - yahoo! - it works on ear hair.</li>
            <li>He tried several trimmers and according to him they did not do a good job of trimming the hair.</li>
            <li>Now he can give himself a nice and complete face job.</li>
            <li>At least you have this review to warn you about the best type of trimmer for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can completely rinse it, which is a nice feature</li>
            <li>this does its job with a lot more precision and better results than the Norelco G380 trimmer (no longer available – the G380 was a bit of a heavier use trimmer, which was better for trimming sideburns but not nose hair, for example, and not nearly as precise as the 3000) that I’ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well and is comfortable to use, a bit higher priced, but well worth the extra for a very nice item.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast, no grabbing.</li>
            <li>Overall it’s a very good nose trimmer with extra features.</li>
            <li>This is a genuinely useful tool – I plan to keep it on my bathroom sink setup, for when I shave and have to go in and get stray hairs/clean up.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for the first couple of weeks, then without any signs of slowing down, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>However, for a good nose trimmer that is compact for travel and for easy hidden storage with no pinches of hairs to deal with, the Norelco Trimmer is a decent buy.</li>
            <li>not that they&#x27;re bushy, but I thought a consistent look would be nice, I ultimately decided against it.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it trimmed me far better than the panasonics or scissors designed for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing about this device is that it is powered by a single AA battery.</li>
            <li>The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li>For this type of device, I like that very much.</li>
            <li>and it is very gentle when trimming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a fine replacement for my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>While my original review was accurate at the time - the item has just stopped working after only 90 days.</li>
            <li>first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>I didn’t experience any pain/hair pulling (like with a rotary-blade) – it seems to have a pretty smooth action, and you’ll know you got the hair when you hear the ‘thwack’ of it being cut.  </li>
            <li>Runs on one-AA battery, and is pretty intuitive to use.  </li>
            <li>This is truly a wonder of the modern age!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all one needs ;-)</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t sweep too fast because the Philips is not that powerful but it gets the job done efficiently.  </li>
            <li>This device is my first foray into this technology</li>
            <li>This one is different in that the cutter is on the edge of the &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34; you shove up your nose, while most others have the cutter on the end.</li>
            <li>First one that works as advertised, well designed</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really doesn&#x27;t ever pull on the nose hairs, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a decent and easy to stash low profile electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it is better for eyebrow hair, which tends to grow straight and on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>I have worn out a couple of the usual kind of nose trimmer -- the Panasonic kind with a couple blades spinning inside a carefully arranged cage.  </li>
            <li>I would have usually, very carefully, used a pair of haircut scissors, but I always worry about doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shielded blade effortlessly trims hairs for a clean look, while the ergonomic shape provides the ability to precisely control the trimming wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li>A protective cap is also supplied to help protect the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, considering price, functionality, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device.</li>
            <li>Still - it cuts well, certainly much closer than the one it replaced.</li>
            <li>Just really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product because I&#x27;m a fan of their shavers...</li>
            <li>I prefer the pointer type but this one, the straight edge has merit too.</li>
            <li>There must be a lot of guys out there with really, really hairy</li>
            <li>He is very contented with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable, close, and smooth trimming of the nose, facial hair, neck hair, and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>They attempted to &amp;#34;troubleshoot&amp;#34; the device for me, but there is really nothing to troubleshoot.</li>
            <li>But, since I like this device so much I went to Wal-Mart and bought lithium batteries.</li>
            <li>the comb attachment worked well on keeping my eyebrows from getting too bushy (much easier than using scissors).</li>
            <li>My husband just picked this up and really loves it.  </li>
            <li>was satisfied until it abruptly stopped working.</li>
            <li>in all, I like this better than any other nasal trimmer I&#x27;ve used, but I still think there&#x27;s room for improvement.</li>
            <li>I ran it under water to cool it down and clean it, then tried again</li>
            <li>It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.lity, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device.</li>
            <li>The same is true for getting stray hairs out of my ears.</li>
            <li>It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.</li>
            <li>They worked well in my testing as did the main blade.</li>
            <li>As an older gentleman I have found that while the hair on my head is getting thinner</li>
            <li>You have to stick the trimmer so far up your nostril in order to cut hair, that it quickly becomes apparent</li>
            <li>If you have the  need I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The unit is very light in your hand, too, so it doesn&#x27;t stress even my arthritic shoulders to hold it up for the few seconds it takes to get rid of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Particularly around the outer nostril, the flat edge lets you quickly sweep around the edge and cut everything in it&#x27;s path.  </li>
            <li>To put this in a time perspective, the Panasonic would take about 60 seconds to trim nose hair; the Norelco, 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Both trim comfortably with minimal to no pain.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>When your battery finally gives out, you just replace it with a fresh one.</li>
            <li>Coarse hairs tended to jam that kind of trimmer and coarse hairs are the only ones getting trimmed.  </li>
            <li>A few times the trimmer would not turn on, but removing and re-attaching the top worked,</li>
            <li>Phillips also comes with some accessories if you want to use it on eyebrows or other fine</li>
            <li>The vibration tickles a bit, but it&#x27;s worth dealing with to get rid of the occasional wild hair I&#x27;ll get in my ear.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more effective than the standard circular nose hair trimmers, and maybe if the blade were higher up on the device it might be, but as it stands, this trimmer verges on being painful.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 3000 series trimmer is a compact handheld trimmer that is very useful if you need to safely trim eyebrows (including your monobrow area), ear hair (sadly, I’m at the age where it has begun growing like kudzu) and nose hair</li>
            <li>(higher than last I saw on Amazon) but it can be had at Target or Walmart for &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much, much better than small scissors.</li>
            <li>my face looks baby soft again!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think of this when I bought it, but the tip of the trimmer is actually pretty big.  </li>
            <li>At first I believed that he was not using it properly even though he has experience with another brand.  </li>
            <li>The eyebrow attachments and blade cover just seem easy to misplace, why a little bag or case wasn’t included is beyond me.</li>
            <li>This one uses a rapid back and forth scissor action and seems to work a little better.  </li>
            <li>He also liked the price as this one cost him much less than other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Does a great job cutting on nose, ear and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>And I say that with surprise, because, for of all these models I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried, this one actually DOES work, and, as a follow-on, it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works, as I bought it to replace a locally-sourced model that chewed through batteries</li>
            <li>This is the straight edge trimmer, like for side burns on a shaver, just smaller.</li>
            <li>The nose is already sensitive</li>
            <li>But I bought them and was surprised to see that it now works again.</li>
            <li>actually was a bit easier to use, but this did perform equally well, just that I had to provide the rotation to keep the blades at the right location.</li>
            <li>In football analogy terms for the guys out there - my Panasonic is used for my short quick passing game which is called upon more, the Philips Norelco is my deep threat that stretches the field with a skillset that the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Still, the bare tool works fantastically to clear hairs from perilously sensitive areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This device will trim closely to the skin and will do so with no grabbing or pulling (yes, the ads are true), and with little to no abrasion on the skin.</li>
            <li>Expected more based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li>The handle is the on and off switch, and although it feels a little too fragile when twisting, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>It suddenly stopped working, so I bought a new lithium battery.  </li>
            <li>The Phillips battery life is solid, and the trimmer really does a solid job.</li>
            <li>Short of transplanting that stray hair, your only real options are to ignore it or to cut if off.  </li>
            <li>even if it took several tries (yes, it was a fresh battery).</li>
            <li>The attachments are not really useful and the blade does not stick out far enough to be all that useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two major types of nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>This seems like a major flaw in the design, although maybe this is just a problem with mine.</li>
            <li>of my concerns is that there are three very small parts that seem easy to misplace or lose.</li>
            <li>I like the protective cap, the general size and shape, and the rubber grip.</li>
            <li>It does not pull or burn, but it simply barely works.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the contour of my nostrils, but this thing barely cuts anything.</li>
            <li>It never jammed and it never pulled a hair.  </li>
            <li>So far in my initial testing of this I found the trimmer worked quite well on ears and with</li>
            <li>Well with age comes hair apparently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple other trimmers which didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Unlike other trimmers, it has a much longer and angled &amp;#</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried numerous nose trimmers with little success.</li>
            <li>Both of these used the rotary top, both were only somewhat effective at actual trimming (with the occasional painful pull), and both died within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But at this price range you can get other similar trimmers with both the vibrating straight blade and the rotating blade.</li>
            <li>The combs have tabs on each side to line up with the trim blade, and should go on with the larger opening first, but regardles of which attachment I use, it squeezed the trimming wand such that the motor slows down a bit.</li>
            <li>It trims much closer than the other kind of nose hair trimmer (circular cutting)</li>
            <li>I previously used a razor trimmer, with very limited success.</li>
            <li>The little blade covers are really neat though and work well for eyebrows.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The best nose trimmer i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best of this style trimmer that I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service; great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent concept but the cutter bar doesn&#x27;t let the hairs in, so it skips/misses the hairs.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best of all I don’t have to monitor his progress.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best ones (Groom Mate Platinum XL and Panasonic ER-GN30-K) are both rotary models.  </li>
            <li> If you are going for eyebrows, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is perfectly designed.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> That said, I think for perfectionists, the combo of the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 and a rotary trimmer would be ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have both on my team.  </li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow trim.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> I haven’t gotten around to replacing it, so I was happy to be offered to opportunity to review this product, the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great.  </li>
            <li> It is perfectly designed and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> Just a great design, all around.</li>
            <li> ; (that&#x27;s actually a good rating by me).  </li>
            <li> good quality</li>
            <li> Great value, nice finishing touch.</li>
            <li> He loved it</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t have good motor control, but who has the time?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all in all a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall he recommends this trimmer as doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I loved it until a week ago.  </li>
            <li> Is a good value for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So for the first time ever I had the opportunity to try a nose/ear hair trimmer, the Phillips Norelco Nose Trimmer, model NT3355/60, and came away quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to wash</li>
            <li> Very effective, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all--simply does not cut effectively.  </li>
            <li> I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> Also, I wish it came with some kind of storage stand or bag.  </li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price, works really well.</li>
            <li> Really good and powerfull :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of time.... while I was trimming the blades started to warm up.  </li>
            <li> Nice product and value for money</li>
            <li> He tried this one and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> saw that he could also trim his eyebrows and he also liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about, would be much nice if it came with a rechargeable battery pack</li>
            <li> The whole thing is wonderfully self contained, with an ON/OFF switch and a battery opening.</li>
            <li> This one comes with an eyebrow trimmer which may be nice for some people.</li>
            <li> Nice nose trimmer...</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to do some manscaping again!</li>
            <li> Not the most effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great tool for in-between-barber-shop maintenance, and because it&#x27;s easy to use, does the job, and is pain free, even the most averse to manscaping will use it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month; I changed the first battery after it died and it no longer works at all</li>
            <li> The Norelco has more exposed blade area which requires fewer passes.</li>
            <li> Seems to be more durable than what I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The blades are somewhat obstructed by the orange housing (compared to competitors models), which means that you may need to work a bit more to get everything trimmed.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> Nose ok.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m OK with that for the price.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> This works as well or better.</li>
            <li> With this trimmer; we’re able to maintain his nose, ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Sure there is a two year warranty but who keeps receipts for a $10 item.</li>
            <li> The more I tried to trim, the more I ended up just poking myself.  </li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> Which type is better?</li>
            <li> where most trimmers either hit skin or just don&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nose is much more comfortable now that I have cleared it out!</li>
            <li> Fully washable and can safely can be rinsed under the faucet</li>
            <li> A nice grip and fits comfortably in your hands</li>
            <li> I suspect they designed it this way because the trimmer is waterproof and an on-off switch might be more prone to leak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t work better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still glad I have this.</li>
            <li> It had the Philips Norelco NT8110 Nose and Ear Trimmer before and likes this one even better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Rather than using the rotary top, it cuts along one side of the angled tip.</li>
            <li> top rotates, and this is how you turn it on/off as well as removing the top for battery installation.</li>
            <li> The vibrating blade can still nick you, so compared to the rotating ones it would require more care before putting it into your nose or ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a nose or ear trimmer before and was worried that it would hurt but even more that I would cut myself up.  </li>
            <li> This works perfectly because hair definitely comes off, but there is no chance of you taking a huge chunk out of your eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> , the Norelco is superior because it is so much faster and more efficient.</li>
            <li> The straight slim edge effectively removes the offending hairs without a problem and the devise is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is not so good as you go deeper in the nostril with hairs sticking straight out.  </li>
            <li> I still like my Panasonic pointy type best but will probably use both as each do something the other doesn’t.</li>
            <li> A rotary head, like those used on some other trimmers, is best for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> The two attachments are easy to lose and the trimmer falls over fairly easily if stood on end.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painless and easy to use.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s so easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> This is an easy tool to use, both compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This one is perfect- powerful, quiet and non-complicated.</li>
            <li> It has a lot more power and is easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> It is relatively easy to use and for me also worked as a sideburn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He liked his older one better</li>
            <li> I also find this PN3300 to have good build quality and it comes with a free high quality AA battery (lithium disposable).  </li>
            <li> They do work fine once you get the one you wanted.  </li>
            <li> it works fine, no complains here.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he said that it did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is great - quick, painless, reliable - my only gripe about the Panasonic is that the rounded tip is shorter that I would like in some cases which means I have to mow the lawn more often.  </li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li> trimmer is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> 100% comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to clean up easily.  </li>
            <li> It will fit in the ear canal if you have a hair problem there and can take attachments for eyebrow trimming.</li>
            <li> yeah, it&#x27;s another cheaply made product no one should buy.</li>
            <li> so which is good if you are prone to shoving things too far up your nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are good products made in China but price point items are typically not.</li>
            <li> My current go-to trimmer (for one year+) is the very popular Panasonic with a rounded tip.  </li>
            <li> As long as your expectations are not unrealistically high, you should be very happy with this ear and nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- it does clean work, but it comes with the price, see below</li>
            <li> It trims cleanly without any pulling.</li>
            <li> This requires a somewhat different technique to use (you have to rotate the trimmer inside your nose), but ends up being much more effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe that you could just rinse the trimmer under the faucet to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Passed this on right to my husband and - yahoo! - it works on ear hair.</li>
            <li> He tried several trimmers and according to him they did not do a good job of trimming the hair.</li>
            <li> Now he can give himself a nice and complete face job.</li>
            <li> At least you have this review to warn you about the best type of trimmer for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can completely rinse it, which is a nice feature</li>
            <li> this does its job with a lot more precision and better results than the Norelco G380 trimmer (no longer available – the G380 was a bit of a heavier use trimmer, which was better for trimming sideburns but not nose hair, for example, and not nearly as precise as the 3000) that I’ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well and is comfortable to use, a bit higher priced, but well worth the extra for a very nice item.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast, no grabbing.</li>
            <li> Overall it’s a very good nose trimmer with extra features.</li>
            <li> This is a genuinely useful tool – I plan to keep it on my bathroom sink setup, for when I shave and have to go in and get stray hairs/clean up.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for the first couple of weeks, then without any signs of slowing down, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> However, for a good nose trimmer that is compact for travel and for easy hidden storage with no pinches of hairs to deal with, the Norelco Trimmer is a decent buy.</li>
            <li> not that they&#x27;re bushy, but I thought a consistent look would be nice, I ultimately decided against it.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it trimmed me far better than the panasonics or scissors designed for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing about this device is that it is powered by a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> For this type of device, I like that very much.</li>
            <li> and it is very gentle when trimming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a fine replacement for my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> While my original review was accurate at the time - the item has just stopped working after only 90 days.</li>
            <li> first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> I didn’t experience any pain/hair pulling (like with a rotary-blade) – it seems to have a pretty smooth action, and you’ll know you got the hair when you hear the ‘thwack’ of it being cut.  </li>
            <li> Runs on one-AA battery, and is pretty intuitive to use.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a wonder of the modern age!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all one needs ;-)</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t sweep too fast because the Philips is not that powerful but it gets the job done efficiently.  </li>
            <li> This device is my first foray into this technology</li>
            <li> This one is different in that the cutter is on the edge of the &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34; you shove up your nose, while most others have the cutter on the end.</li>
            <li> First one that works as advertised, well designed</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really doesn&#x27;t ever pull on the nose hairs, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a decent and easy to stash low profile electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it is better for eyebrow hair, which tends to grow straight and on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> I have worn out a couple of the usual kind of nose trimmer -- the Panasonic kind with a couple blades spinning inside a carefully arranged cage.  </li>
            <li> I would have usually, very carefully, used a pair of haircut scissors, but I always worry about doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shielded blade effortlessly trims hairs for a clean look, while the ergonomic shape provides the ability to precisely control the trimming wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li> A protective cap is also supplied to help protect the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, considering price, functionality, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device.</li>
            <li> Still - it cuts well, certainly much closer than the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> Just really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this product because I&#x27;m a fan of their shavers...</li>
            <li> I prefer the pointer type but this one, the straight edge has merit too.</li>
            <li> There must be a lot of guys out there with really, really hairy</li>
            <li> He is very contented with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable, close, and smooth trimming of the nose, facial hair, neck hair, and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> They attempted to &amp;#34;troubleshoot&amp;#34; the device for me, but there is really nothing to troubleshoot.</li>
            <li> But, since I like this device so much I went to Wal-Mart and bought lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> the comb attachment worked well on keeping my eyebrows from getting too bushy (much easier than using scissors).</li>
            <li> My husband just picked this up and really loves it.  </li>
            <li> was satisfied until it abruptly stopped working.</li>
            <li> in all, I like this better than any other nasal trimmer I&#x27;ve used, but I still think there&#x27;s room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I ran it under water to cool it down and clean it, then tried again</li>
            <li> It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.lity, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device.</li>
            <li> The same is true for getting stray hairs out of my ears.</li>
            <li> It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.</li>
            <li> They worked well in my testing as did the main blade.</li>
            <li> As an older gentleman I have found that while the hair on my head is getting thinner</li>
            <li> You have to stick the trimmer so far up your nostril in order to cut hair, that it quickly becomes apparent</li>
            <li> If you have the  need I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The unit is very light in your hand, too, so it doesn&#x27;t stress even my arthritic shoulders to hold it up for the few seconds it takes to get rid of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Particularly around the outer nostril, the flat edge lets you quickly sweep around the edge and cut everything in it&#x27;s path.  </li>
            <li> To put this in a time perspective, the Panasonic would take about 60 seconds to trim nose hair; the Norelco, 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Both trim comfortably with minimal to no pain.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> When your battery finally gives out, you just replace it with a fresh one.</li>
            <li> Coarse hairs tended to jam that kind of trimmer and coarse hairs are the only ones getting trimmed.  </li>
            <li> A few times the trimmer would not turn on, but removing and re-attaching the top worked,</li>
            <li> Phillips also comes with some accessories if you want to use it on eyebrows or other fine</li>
            <li> The vibration tickles a bit, but it&#x27;s worth dealing with to get rid of the occasional wild hair I&#x27;ll get in my ear.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more effective than the standard circular nose hair trimmers, and maybe if the blade were higher up on the device it might be, but as it stands, this trimmer verges on being painful.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 3000 series trimmer is a compact handheld trimmer that is very useful if you need to safely trim eyebrows (including your monobrow area), ear hair (sadly, I’m at the age where it has begun growing like kudzu) and nose hair</li>
            <li> (higher than last I saw on Amazon) but it can be had at Target or Walmart for &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much better than small scissors.</li>
            <li> my face looks baby soft again!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think of this when I bought it, but the tip of the trimmer is actually pretty big.  </li>
            <li> At first I believed that he was not using it properly even though he has experience with another brand.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow attachments and blade cover just seem easy to misplace, why a little bag or case wasn’t included is beyond me.</li>
            <li> This one uses a rapid back and forth scissor action and seems to work a little better.  </li>
            <li> He also liked the price as this one cost him much less than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cutting on nose, ear and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> And I say that with surprise, because, for of all these models I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried, this one actually DOES work, and, as a follow-on, it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works, as I bought it to replace a locally-sourced model that chewed through batteries</li>
            <li> This is the straight edge trimmer, like for side burns on a shaver, just smaller.</li>
            <li> The nose is already sensitive</li>
            <li> But I bought them and was surprised to see that it now works again.</li>
            <li> actually was a bit easier to use, but this did perform equally well, just that I had to provide the rotation to keep the blades at the right location.</li>
            <li> In football analogy terms for the guys out there - my Panasonic is used for my short quick passing game which is called upon more, the Philips Norelco is my deep threat that stretches the field with a skillset that the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> Still, the bare tool works fantastically to clear hairs from perilously sensitive areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device will trim closely to the skin and will do so with no grabbing or pulling (yes, the ads are true), and with little to no abrasion on the skin.</li>
            <li> Expected more based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The handle is the on and off switch, and although it feels a little too fragile when twisting, it works fine.  </li>
            <li> It suddenly stopped working, so I bought a new lithium battery.  </li>
            <li> The Phillips battery life is solid, and the trimmer really does a solid job.</li>
            <li> Short of transplanting that stray hair, your only real options are to ignore it or to cut if off.  </li>
            <li> even if it took several tries (yes, it was a fresh battery).</li>
            <li> The attachments are not really useful and the blade does not stick out far enough to be all that useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two major types of nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> This seems like a major flaw in the design, although maybe this is just a problem with mine.</li>
            <li> of my concerns is that there are three very small parts that seem easy to misplace or lose.</li>
            <li> I like the protective cap, the general size and shape, and the rubber grip.</li>
            <li> It does not pull or burn, but it simply barely works.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the contour of my nostrils, but this thing barely cuts anything.</li>
            <li> It never jammed and it never pulled a hair.  </li>
            <li> So far in my initial testing of this I found the trimmer worked quite well on ears and with</li>
            <li> Well with age comes hair apparently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other trimmers which didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Unlike other trimmers, it has a much longer and angled &amp;#</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried numerous nose trimmers with little success.</li>
            <li> Both of these used the rotary top, both were only somewhat effective at actual trimming (with the occasional painful pull), and both died within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at this price range you can get other similar trimmers with both the vibrating straight blade and the rotating blade.</li>
            <li> The combs have tabs on each side to line up with the trim blade, and should go on with the larger opening first, but regardles of which attachment I use, it squeezed the trimming wand such that the motor slows down a bit.</li>
            <li> It trims much closer than the other kind of nose hair trimmer (circular cutting)</li>
            <li> I previously used a razor trimmer, with very limited success.</li>
            <li> The little blade covers are really neat though and work well for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> We previously owned another trimmer and he never complained until this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep doing the other thing the old way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers that had rotary action.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy another Philips product - have had many negative experiences in the past.</li>
            <li> I did not find it effective at cutting long hairs at all.  </li>
            <li> out of 5 nosehairs (stars) in consideration of price/value (I would ding it a few stars at a higher price relative to other competitive options out there).</li>
            <li> It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> The trimmer comes with a ‘long’ and ‘short’ trimmer attachment, which you will use to trim your eyebrows correctly, so you don’t inadvertently shave one off.  </li>
            <li> is it has a long skinny tip that can run the deep route when you need it to.  </li>
            <li> It takes one AA battery that comes with it,a cover for the tip and two attachments for eyebrows, short and long.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow attachments come in either short or long.</li>
            <li> The Philips NT3355 has a flat edge.  </li>
            <li> Using small clippers have been less that useful.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive models from other makers.</li>
            <li> I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.</li>
            <li> Another complaint is that generally they tend to pull hairs frequently, leading to discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A minor design flaw that I can&#x27;t bring myself to complain about because of the device&#x27;s performance and</li>
            <li> but what is a middle aged guy to do?</li>
            <li> But then again, rotary ones don&#x27;t claim to do eyebrows, whereas this one claims to do noses and ears (it does, but not nearly as well as a rotary one).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these things have been around.</li>
            <li> , I m dead serious from their little razors to their televisions, I ve never had luck with this garbage brand :)</li>
            <li> but it left some odd long hairs and didn&#x27;t touch some areas at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just small enough to put up your nose... but only 1 side is functional</li>
            <li> Write it off to typical Chinese junk.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a lot less pulling with this versus the rotary type trimmer.</li>
            <li> These are not great, fine for thicker hairs but for thin hairs it barely cuts through.</li>
            <li> after having this trimmer only a little over a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as clumsy as they come, so if it was possible to cut or hurt yourself, I expect I would have found it once I finally got up the courage to try it.  </li>
            <li> This eyebrow trimmer was not very efficient, either.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no pulling or discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> It is partially waterproof, meaning you can rinse it off with flowing water from the tap if you need to do that</li>
            <li> One of the sad facts of aging is that, for men at least, you stop growing hair where you want it (on the top of your head) and start growing it where you don’t want it (on/in your ears, out of your nose, etc.)  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;re used to the other style, but its definitely not rocket science.</li>
            <li> which I have used for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Panasonic takes much longer to get all the hairs because the blade is hidden behind a guard with only a few perforations for hair to get through.</li>
            <li> (and, any other stray hairs that might be plaguing you).  </li>
            <li> Pretty pathetic when you can get excited about a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> but so did my other one(panasonic).</li>
            <li> The other is the pointed tip multi surface trimmer.</li>
            <li> This included some moderately expensive models from major brands, Well, this Philips device actually works, and works WELL.</li>
            <li> It feels unnatural putting this thin long razor deep into my nose, which it needs to go because the blade is not at the tip (unlike the Panasonic) but rather a centimeter or so from the end.  </li>
            <li> Usually, they have not trimmed hairs that are over a millimeter long.</li>
            <li> This thing is about average for its price range.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> At $15 or less</li>
            <li> Hair got stuck in cutter in less that 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic, which after 4 years needed to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this thing did not work for me because I could not get even half of it into my nose and whatever I could get in, didn&#x27;t trim any hair.  </li>
            <li> And odd hair that pops up all over the place and mystifies me.</li>
            <li> I mean obviously it trimmed a few....</li>
            <li> A minor complaint is that twisting the device to the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position is sometimes a bit difficult, and it&#x27;s easy to make the mistake of turning it in the wrong direction, which ejects the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used, but not liked, several trimmers in the past, including the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just needed to do a little nose and brows.</li>
            <li> My thought was make the battery an alkaline and include a little fabric bag.</li>
            <li> Both attachments are very similar in looks and size and the contrast in the words saying &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; are very hard to see.  </li>
            <li> there’s one set of back-forth cutting heads mounted on a skinny tip, which makes it very maneuverable to reach into your nostrils or ear canal, for example, and still trim with comfort and precision.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a trimmer with a round end that trims but doesn’t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and it is dead again.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Being in the “cutter camp”, years ago I bought a Sharper Image Nose Hair Trimmer, but a few months ago, it bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few uses</li>
            <li> The number one selling trimmer for less than$15?!</li>
            <li> My husband has a mass of soft nose hair which can difficult to deal with and usually with small scissors (ouch).  </li>
            <li> The cutting blades are so far back from the tip that it&#x27;s nearly useless for the purpose of the nose.</li>
            <li> but it just utterly failed for me on multiple levels.  </li>
            <li> This device is so small that it can access any stray hair because it maneuvers to any angle.</li>
            <li> After I read the manual and observed his final attempt, I could not find anything wrong, at least on his part.  </li>
            <li> This thing is pretty worthless.  </li>
            <li> Hardly cuts the hair.</li>
            <li> It’s a bit hard to do.  </li>
            <li> On the con side for the PN, the sawtooth cutting style is a bit more uncomfortable than the round tip style and can lead to the occasional dreaded pulled hair resulting in Dad accidentally using some bad language around the kids (%@!%!!).  </li>
            <li> I have not used the supplied attachments for eyebrows yet (because that&#x27;s not what my need was), but I have no reason to believe that they are not effective, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back to a circular cutting blade.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with any of the designs for these.</li>
            <li> You need to manually rotate it inside your nose which can be a little awkward and less convenient than the rotary style trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This is a precision and high wuality trimmer for the annoying hair growth in nasal areas as well as ears.</li>
            <li> You turn it on by twisting the lower half of the base (as referenced above).</li>
            <li> I bought one of the expensive ones and was a little intimidated.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a little scary if you have to stick it in your ear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> I mean CLOSE!.  </li>
            <li> poor design, poor performance eye brow trimmer suck.. do not buy the product..</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, never able to cut a single thread of hair</li>
            <li> After the third use, he has opted to no longer ise this trimmer because it is very painful.  </li>
            <li> The blades are flimsy and any bump on the cage can render the device useless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these take some time with in and out motions.  </li>
            <li> The blade is tilted at an angle makes it difficult to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li> Worked very poorly.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The way the blades are arranged also makes it somewhat difficult to trim hairs that hug the side of your nostril, and you can forget using it at all if you have a cold because it will jam, even if you think your nose is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you have to do all this awkward spinning and twirling of the thing in while you&#x27;re trimming.</li>
            <li> You can hear the blades cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> this is going to be a very uncomfortable experience.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have one and was very skeptical that this was the problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not recommend this product since it was painful in the nose region.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer ever used!</li>
            <li> I used to use mustache wax to keep my nose hairs from looking horrible.</li>
            <li> This thing came, Turned on once and never again, Phillips is the worst brand you ever get</li>
            <li> But then I thought, &amp;#34;Well, the rotary ones do a horrible job on eyebrows.&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband had one just like this and he wanted another one.  So he has been&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with this Norelco Trimmer</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all--simply does not cut effectively.  It does not pull or burn, but it simply barely works.</li>
            <li> The best nose trimmer i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review. So I decided to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current trimmer is a Panasonic ER-GN30, a trimmer using rotary blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer, $11.99. This is dual blade trimmer and advertised as No Pulling Guaranteed. I have used this style of trimmer before. It works, but IMHO, not as well as a rotary trimmer. I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose. The &amp;#34;DualCut&amp;#34; technology is not as efficient. This comes with a AA battery and a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. This eyebrow trimmer was not very efficient, either. Overall, this trimmer works, but it is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, $13.99. Different body color, but same trimmer. This advertises &amp;#34;Lithium Technology.&amp;#34; This translates to a AA lithium battery. Comes with a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; eyebrow comb and &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short. Were I to choose between the two, I would definitely purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer, $19.87. This is the identical body to the NT3355/60. It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch. I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 3000 series trimmer is a compact handheld trimmer that is very useful if you need to safely trim eyebrows (including your monobrow area), ear hair (sadly, I’m at the age where it has begun growing like kudzu) and nose hair (and, any other stray hairs that might be plaguing you).  It’s very simple in design and to use: there’s one set of back-forth cutting heads mounted on a skinny tip, which makes it very maneuverable to reach into your nostrils or ear canal, for example, and still trim with comfort and precision.  I didn’t experience any pain/hair pulling (like with a rotary-blade) – it seems to have a pretty smooth action, and you’ll know you got the hair when you hear the ‘thwack’ of it being cut.  The trimmer comes with a ‘long’ and ‘short’ trimmer attachment, which you will use to trim your eyebrows correctly, so you don’t inadvertently shave one off.  Runs on one-AA battery, and is pretty intuitive to use.  This is a genuinely useful tool – I plan to keep it on my bathroom sink setup, for when I shave and have to go in and get stray hairs/clean up.  A bit pricey, but this does its job with a lot more precision and better results than the Norelco G380 trimmer (no longer available – the G380 was a bit of a heavier use trimmer, which was better for trimming sideburns but not nose hair, for example, and not nearly as precise as the 3000) that I’ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Philips Norelco NT3355 (3300 series) for about a month now and I rate it &amp;#34;two nose hairs up&amp;#34; (that&#x27;s actually a good rating by me).  My current go-to trimmer (for one year+) is the very popular Panasonic with a rounded tip.  The Panasonic is great - quick, painless, reliable - my only gripe about the Panasonic is that the rounded tip is shorter that I would like in some cases which means I have to mow the lawn more often.  Enter this Philips Norelco 3300 (PN3300) series - the #1 thing this PN has going for it is it has a long skinny tip that can run the deep route when you need it to.  On the con side for the PN, the sawtooth cutting style is a bit more uncomfortable than the round tip style and can lead to the occasional dreaded pulled hair resulting in Dad accidentally using some bad language around the kids (%@!%!!).  So now I find myself using two trimmers in my toolkit.  In football analogy terms for the guys out there - my Panasonic is used for my short quick passing game which is called upon more, the Philips Norelco is my deep threat that stretches the field with a skillset that the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t have.  I&#x27;m happy to have both on my team.  I also find this PN3300 to have good build quality and it comes with a free high quality AA battery (lithium disposable).  The price on this PN3300 seems to be all over the map - currently I see it on Amazon for $30+ (higher than last I saw on Amazon) but it can be had at Target or Walmart for &amp;#60;$15.  At $15 or less I rate this Phillips Norelco 5 out of 5 nosehairs (stars) in consideration of price/value (I would ding it a few stars at a higher price relative to other competitive options out there).</li>
            <li> Did the job perfectly. Absolutely no pulling or discomfort at all. If you have the  need I would highly recommend this product. The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> As long as your expectations are not unrealistically high, you should be very happy with this ear and nose hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve owned a number of these devices over the years, and all ended up either in a box somewhere, donated, or thrown away because they simply did not work. This included some moderately expensive models from major brands, Well, this Philips device actually works, and works WELL. And I say that with surprise, because, for of all these models I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried, this one actually DOES work, and, as a follow-on, it is so reasonably priced. This device will trim closely to the skin and will do so with no grabbing or pulling (yes, the ads are true), and with little to no abrasion on the skin. I have not used the supplied attachments for eyebrows yet (because that&#x27;s not what my need was), but I have no reason to believe that they are not effective, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this device is that it is powered by a single AA battery. You don&#x27;t have to fumble with recharger bases and equipment, and you never have to worry about &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34; for a rechargeable n-cad battery (only the more expensive trimmers will use lithium ion battery which has no memory effect). When your battery finally gives out, you just replace it with a fresh one. For this type of device, I like that very much. A minor complaint is that twisting the device to the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position is sometimes a bit difficult, and it&#x27;s easy to make the mistake of turning it in the wrong direction, which ejects the battery. A minor design flaw that I can&#x27;t bring myself to complain about because of the device&#x27;s performance and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is comfortable to hold. You turn it on by twisting the lower half of the base (as referenced above). It is partially waterproof, meaning you can rinse it off with flowing water from the tap if you need to do that (but I doubt you will). A protective cap is also supplied to help protect the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, considering price, functionality, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device. It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.lity, comfortable hold, and the use of a standard AA battery, I would rate this as a five-star device. It is the first--no, ONLY-- such device I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with.</li>
            <li> poor design, poor performance eye brow trimmer suck.. do not buy the product..</li>
            <li> Great buy. good quality</li>
            <li> Best of this style trimmer that I have found.</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively for nose trimming so I will only comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit intimidating with the exposed blade but there is no pain or discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;-With only a couple swirls around the nostril, the trimming is done. It only takes seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System]] which I have used for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Panasonic takes much longer to get all the hairs because the blade is hidden behind a guard with only a few perforations for hair to get through. The Norelco has more exposed blade area which requires fewer passes. To put this in a time perspective, the Panasonic would take about 60 seconds to trim nose hair; the Norelco, 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Both trim comfortably with minimal to no pain.&lt;br /&gt;-The Panasonic has a wider, blunter tip so which is good if you are prone to shoving things too far up your nose.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, the Norelco is superior because it is so much faster and more efficient.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really doesn&#x27;t ever pull on the nose hairs, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a decent and easy to stash low profile electric trimmer.  The handle is the on and off switch, and although it feels a little too fragile when twisting, it works fine.  It takes one AA battery that comes with it,a cover for the tip and two attachments for eyebrows, short and long.  Both attachments are very similar in looks and size and the contrast in the words saying &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; are very hard to see.  They do work fine once you get the one you wanted.  Also, I wish it came with some kind of storage stand or bag.  The two attachments are easy to lose and the trimmer falls over fairly easily if stood on end.  However, for a good nose trimmer that is compact for travel and for easy hidden storage with no pinches of hairs to deal with, the Norelco Trimmer is a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Seems to be more durable than what I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Hair got stuck in cutter in less that 5 minutes.  Cutter no longer works.  Cutter attachment was brushed, removed, and washed.  Worst trimmer ever used!</li>
            <li> Great value, nice finishing touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much better than small scissors. It&#x27;s painless and easy to use. And, it&#x27;s so easy to take care of. You can just rinse it after use. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The number one selling trimmer for less than$15?! I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works, as I bought it to replace a locally-sourced model that chewed through batteries like there is no tomorrow. The Phillips battery life is solid, and the trimmer really does a solid job. The blades are somewhat obstructed by the orange housing (compared to competitors models), which means that you may need to work a bit more to get everything trimmed. Still - it cuts well, certainly much closer than the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> I like this lightweight, safety-designed trimmer. The vibration tickles a bit, but it&#x27;s worth dealing with to get rid of the occasional wild hair I&#x27;ll get in my ear. I would have usually, very carefully, used a pair of haircut scissors, but I always worry about doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shielded blade effortlessly trims hairs for a clean look, while the ergonomic shape provides the ability to precisely control the trimming wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As unsure as I was about going after my eyebrows, not that they&#x27;re bushy, but I thought a consistent look would be nice, I ultimately decided against it. The eyebrow attachments come in either short or long. The combs have tabs on each side to line up with the trim blade, and should go on with the larger opening first, but regardles of which attachment I use, it squeezed the trimming wand such that the motor slows down a bit. That was enough to make me change my mind, and I am accustomed to hoe they look as it is. Still, the bare tool works fantastically to clear hairs from perilously sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel of the trimmer utilizes twisting to either switch to its powered on state, or to the extent in order to open the chamber for battery insertion. This is an easy tool to use, both compact and lightweight. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service; great product!</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty worthless.  Won&#x27;t even cut through my hubby&#x27;s ear hair.  Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first couple of weeks, then without any signs of slowing down, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> Gift for my father! He loved it</li>
            <li> Not the most effective trimmer. It does not pull but also doesn&#x27;t cut as well as others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Excellent concept but the cutter bar doesn&#x27;t let the hairs in, so it skips/misses the hairs.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the contour of my nostrils, but this thing barely cuts anything. I went back to a circular cutting blade. Much better.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow trim. Nose ok.</li>
            <li> I used to use mustache wax to keep my nose hairs from looking horrible. I would shape them into a handlebar mustache. I can&#x27;t actually grow a mustache, just nose hairs. Now I use this trimmer and bam! my face looks baby soft again! I also use it to keep my back hair from getting too unruly. This is truly a wonder of the modern age!</li>
            <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned, they only last about 12-18 months but I&#x27;m OK with that for the price. Does a great job cutting on nose, ear and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive models from other makers. Blade is washable, 2 eye brow trimmers included but no case or carry bag. It trims much closer than the other kind of nose hair trimmer (circular cutting) Will buy again at this price!</li>
            <li> Ahhh! That&#x27;s better. I bought one of the expensive ones and was a little intimidated. I&#x27;m not a neanderthal!!! Just needed to do a little nose and brows. This one is perfect- powerful, quiet and non-complicated. I&#x27;ll keep doing the other thing the old way.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality. Fell apart after 3 months and of course beyond Amazon Warentee. Worked very poorly.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast, no grabbing. Does what it is supposed to do without any hassle...that&#x27;s all one needs ;-)</li>
            <li> I had a rotary trimmer. This works as well or better. It has a lot more power and is easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price, works really well.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have worn out a couple of the usual kind of nose trimmer -- the Panasonic kind with a couple blades spinning inside a carefully arranged cage.  The blades are flimsy and any bump on the cage can render the device useless.  Coarse hairs tended to jam that kind of trimmer and coarse hairs are the only ones getting trimmed.  I tried this unit because it cost about the same, but used a different strategy to trim the hairs.  First and foremost, it trimmed me far better than the panasonics or scissors designed for that purpose.  I mean CLOSE!.  It never jammed and it never pulled a hair.  100% comfortable.  It seemed to clean up easily.  I wish I had tried this sooner!</li>
            <li> Just what I need. It does what it says.</li>
            <li> Really good and powerfull :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. Died after two months of infrequent use. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The appearance of this nose trimmer intrigued me so I thought we’d try it. My husband has a trimmer with a round end that trims but doesn’t give a close shave. The Philips Noreco NT 3355/60 does. My husband has a mass of soft nose hair which can difficult to deal with and usually with small scissors (ouch).  With this trimmer; we’re able to maintain his nose, ears and eyebrows. Best of all I don’t have to monitor his progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NT 3355/60 is angled and comes with 2 eye brow combs to trim nose, ears and eyebrows. It is washable.  We haven’t had a issue w/ nicks or cuts. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair either.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well and is comfortable to use, a bit higher priced, but well worth the extra for a very nice item.</li>
            <li> This thing came, Turned on once and never again, Phillips is the worst brand you ever get, I m dead serious from their little razors to their televisions, I ve never had luck with this garbage brand :)</li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic, which after 4 years needed to be replaced.  I don&#x27;t like this type of trimmer.  It feels unnatural putting this thin long razor deep into my nose, which it needs to go because the blade is not at the tip (unlike the Panasonic) but rather a centimeter or so from the end.  I did not find it effective at cutting long hairs at all.  Returning.</li>
            <li> Hardly cuts the hair. Wish I could return it, but I&#x27;ve used it. Thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> was satisfied until it abruptly stopped working. Sure there is a two year warranty but who keeps receipts for a $10 item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other trimmers which didn&#x27;t work very well. This trimmer does a good job and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. I am very disappointed in this product for nose hairs. The cutting blades are so far back from the tip that it&#x27;s nearly useless for the purpose of the nose.</li>
            <li> I am a 5&#x27;9 asian man, and if you want a point of reference for my nose, google a pic of &amp;#34;Won Bin&amp;#34; because I have a very similar looking nose.  Anyway, this thing did not work for me because I could not get even half of it into my nose and whatever I could get in, didn&#x27;t trim any hair.  It seemed like it was just pushing the hairs around.  I mean obviously it trimmed a few.... but it left some odd long hairs and didn&#x27;t touch some areas at all.  Anyway, the tip was just too big.. The more I tried to trim, the more I ended up just poking myself.  Just really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think of this when I bought it, but the tip of the trimmer is actually pretty big.  It&#x27;s just small enough to put up your nose... but only 1 side is functional so you have to do all this awkward spinning and twirling of the thing in while you&#x27;re trimming. Nose trimmer gymnastics?  Anyway, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t have good motor control, but who has the time?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of time.... while I was trimming the blades started to warm up.  I ran it under water to cool it down and clean it, then tried again but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to it that sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product because I&#x27;m a fan of their shavers...but it just utterly failed for me on multiple levels.  Now i have to begin the search again..sigh.</li>
            <li> Not bad&lt;br /&gt;Not great</li>
            <li> These are not great, fine for thicker hairs but for thin hairs it barely cuts through. The attachments are not really useful and the blade does not stick out far enough to be all that useful. Expected more based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, never able to cut a single thread of hair</li>
            <li> this product actually works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this trimmer. You have to stick the trimmer so far up your nostril in order to cut hair, that it quickly becomes apparent this is going to be a very uncomfortable experience. I thought it would be more effective than the standard circular nose hair trimmers, and maybe if the blade were higher up on the device it might be, but as it stands, this trimmer verges on being painful. I basically don&#x27;t use it unless my standard trimmer is out of battery.</li>
            <li> Works OK. I am not thrilled with any of the designs for these.</li>
            <li> Nice product and value for money</li>
            <li> Seems to not want to turn on sometimes but I can still use it. It might just have a lose wire or something.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of nose hair trimmers.  The best ones (Groom Mate Platinum XL and Panasonic ER-GN30-K) are both rotary models.  Unfortunately, these take some time with in and out motions.  The Philips NT3355 has a flat edge.  Particularly around the outer nostril, the flat edge lets you quickly sweep around the edge and cut everything in it&#x27;s path.  You shouldn&#x27;t sweep too fast because the Philips is not that powerful but it gets the job done efficiently.  It is not so good as you go deeper in the nostril with hairs sticking straight out.  That said, I think for perfectionists, the combo of the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 and a rotary trimmer would be ideal.</li>
            <li> Pretty pathetic when you can get excited about a nose hair trimmer but what is a middle aged guy to do? This device is my first foray into this technology and I can report that it does what it is supposed to do, sans pain or frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cadillac of nose hair trimmers - ha!</li>
            <li> It works. but so did my other one(panasonic). This one is different in that the cutter is on the edge of the &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34; you shove up your nose, while most others have the cutter on the end. There is a little bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;re used to the other style, but its definitely not rocket science. Which type is better? Its a horse apiece. These do come with the alternate eyebrow attachments, but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test because my barber keep them trimmed. all in all a good product.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer for my husband. He constantly complains about the hair that grows on his ears. He tried several trimmers and according to him they did not do a good job of trimming the hair. He tried this one and he really liked it. It took all the hair out and his ears are no longer &amp;#34;bushy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He saw that he could also trim his eyebrows and he also liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he recommends this trimmer as doing a good job. He also liked the price as this one cost him much less than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Passed this on right to my husband and - yahoo! - it works on ear hair. And nose hair. And odd hair that pops up all over the place and mystifies me. Unlike other trimmers, it has a much longer and angled &amp;#34;trimmer head&amp;#34; which goes much further up the nose and reaches places such as the edges of ears and the back of the neck, etc. where most trimmers either hit skin or just don&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tool for in-between-barber-shop maintenance, and because it&#x27;s easy to use, does the job, and is pain free, even the most averse to manscaping will use it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for about 8 months.  I loved it until a week ago.  It suddenly stopped working, so I bought a new lithium battery.  I used it one time and it is dead again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The blade is tilted at an angle makes it difficult to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought it and this thing cleans house, period. My nose is much more comfortable now that I have cleared it out!</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it does clean work, but it comes with the price, see below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very hard to use. You need to guess its orientation to make it work properly.&lt;br /&gt;- After several month of use it just stopped working</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two major types of nose hair trimmers. This is the straight edge trimmer, like for side burns on a shaver, just smaller. The other is the pointed tip multi surface trimmer. I prefer the pointer type but this one, the straight edge has merit too. It will fit in the ear canal if you have a hair problem there and can take attachments for eyebrow trimming. This kit includes two attachments for different length eyebrow trimming. They worked well in my testing as did the main blade. It is quiet in operation. It is relatively easy to use and for me also worked as a sideburn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my concerns is that there are three very small parts that seem easy to misplace or lose. The eyebrow attachments and blade cover just seem easy to misplace, why a little bag or case wasn’t included is beyond me. I bought a zippered eyeglass case which holds everything in one place. I did like that the AA battery was included and a bonus, it was a lithium cell. My thought was make the battery an alkaline and include a little fabric bag. Overall it’s a very good nose trimmer with extra features. I still like my Panasonic pointy type best but will probably use both as each do something the other doesn’t.</li>
            <li> One of the sad facts of aging is that, for men at least, you stop growing hair where you want it (on the top of your head) and start growing it where you don’t want it (on/in your ears, out of your nose, etc.)  Short of transplanting that stray hair, your only real options are to ignore it or to cut if off.  Being in the “cutter camp”, years ago I bought a Sharper Image Nose Hair Trimmer, but a few months ago, it bit the dust.  I haven’t gotten around to replacing it, so I was happy to be offered to opportunity to review this product, the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Trims well&lt;br /&gt;- Fully washable and can safely can be rinsed under the faucet&lt;br /&gt;- A nice grip and fits comfortably in your hands&lt;br /&gt;- Is a good value for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- To turn it on/off, you have to twist the body of the trimmer.  It’s a bit hard to do.  I suspect they designed it this way because the trimmer is waterproof and an on-off switch might be more prone to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd:&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with not one, but two eyebrow-trimming snap-on combs.  There must be a lot of guys out there with really, really hairy eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fine replacement for my old trimmer.  Four stars.</li>
            <li> As an older gentleman I have found that while the hair on my head is getting thinner the opposite seems to be happening with my nose and ear hair. Using small clippers have been less that useful. So for the first time ever I had the opportunity to try a nose/ear hair trimmer, the Phillips Norelco Nose Trimmer, model NT3355/60, and came away quite impressed. Very effective, easy to use. The straight slim edge effectively removes the offending hairs without a problem and the devise is very easy to use. Now I&#x27;m wondering why the heck I never used one of these devices before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband used this item in his nose and the tiny bit of ear hair.  After the third use, he has opted to no longer ise this trimmer because it is very painful.  We previously owned another trimmer and he never complained until this one.  At first I believed that he was not using it properly even though he has experience with another brand.  After I read the manual and observed his final attempt, I could not find anything wrong, at least on his part.  He feels as if it is yanking the hair rather than trimming.  The nose is already sensitive enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend this product since it was painful in the nose region.  As always every person&#x27;s mileage and tolerance will vary.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to wash</li>
            <li> First one that works as advertised, well designed</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few uses so yeah, it&#x27;s another cheaply made product no one should buy.</li>
            <li> This is a precision and high wuality trimmer for the annoying hair growth in nasal areas as well as ears. Cuts closely and no snagging or nicks. It is great.  UPDATE:  While my original review was accurate at the time - the item has just stopped working after only 90 days.I changed battery and still nothing. Write it off to typical Chinese junk.  There are good products made in China but price point items are typically not. I would not buy another Philips product - have had many negative experiences in the past.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer The nose trimmer is for my husband. He is very contented with it. Now he can give himself a nice and complete face job.I will recommend any one to buy one of these.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month; I changed the first battery after it died and it no longer works at all</li>
            <li> This model nose trimmer is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, close, and smooth trimming of the nose, facial hair, neck hair, and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two comb heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it. it works fine, no complains here.</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about, would be much nice if it came with a rechargeable battery pack</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer. I like the protective cap, the general size and shape, and the rubber grip. It works well... BUT, it is better for eyebrow hair, which tends to grow straight and on a flat surface. Ear and nose hairs grow in a tubular surface. A rotary head, like those used on some other trimmers, is best for nose and ear hair. I&#x27;m not just saying that. I have both and I tested them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially gave this four stars, because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as rotary trimmers in the nose and ears. But then I thought, &amp;#34;Well, the rotary ones do a horrible job on eyebrows.&amp;#34; But then again, rotary ones don&#x27;t claim to do eyebrows, whereas this one claims to do noses and ears (it does, but not nearly as well as a rotary one). Oh well, give them the benefit of the doubt. At least you have this review to warn you about the best type of trimmer for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going for ears and nose, buy a rotary model. If you are going for eyebrows, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this trimmer. It is perfectly designed and amazingly effective. The nose-hair trimmer can be moved around at any angle in my nose, and it never hurts or even tickles. You can hear the blades cutting the hairs. Compared to the cautiousness I had to take when using scissors this thing is a pleasure.  The same is true for getting stray hairs out of my ears. I previously used a razor trimmer, with very limited success. This device is so small that it can access any stray hair because it maneuvers to any angle. If you have bushy eyebrows there are 2 different sized attachments that can be used like a comb going over your eyebrows. This works perfectly because hair definitely comes off, but there is no chance of you taking a huge chunk out of your eyebrow.  The Norelco is perfectly designed. The cutter is not detachable and is washed simply by running water over it. The whole thing is wonderfully self contained, with an ON/OFF switch and a battery opening. It couldn&#x27;t work better.  I don&#x27;t know how long these things have been around. I would have bought one years ago had I known. I plan now to always have one.  UPDATE 4/12/15: after having this trimmer only a little over a month it stopped working. So I replaced the battery with a Duracell Alkaline battery. It still didn&#x27;t work. I tried another alkaline battery. It still didn&#x27;t work. So I called Norelco. They attempted to &amp;#34;troubleshoot&amp;#34; the device for me, but there is really nothing to troubleshoot. It&#x27;s so simple to operate; it either works or it doesn&#x27;t. Then the woman asked me if I had a lithium battery in it, because that is what they recommend. I didn&#x27;t have one and was very skeptical that this was the problem. Shouldn&#x27;t this thing work with any battery on the planet? But, since I like this device so much I went to Wal-Mart and bought lithium batteries. The cheapest ones there were 4 Evereadys for $10.00! - about 80% the cost of the device. But I bought them and was surprised to see that it now works again. This seems like a major flaw in the design, although maybe this is just a problem with mine. Anyway I thought this was information you should know. I&#x27;m still glad I have this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers that had rotary action.  This one uses a rapid back and forth scissor action and seems to work a little better.  You need to manually rotate it inside your nose which can be a little awkward and less convenient than the rotary style trimmers.  Also it&#x27;s a little scary if you have to stick it in your ear.  But overall I&#x27;d say its a keeper.</li>
            <li> So far in my initial testing of this I found the trimmer worked quite well on ears and with the comb attachment worked well on keeping my eyebrows from getting too bushy (much easier than using scissors). For nose hair trimming I feel like a rotary trimer actually was a bit easier to use, but this did perform equally well, just that I had to provide the rotation to keep the blades at the right location. Definitely a lot less pulling with this versus the rotary type trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one in attempt to replace a Norelco NT9110/60 that quit. Both units are very similar in function and operation. The NT3355/60 seems a lot quieter in comparison, but perhaps I received a defective NT9110. Glad to be able to do some manscaping again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he said that it did the job just fine. He liked his older one better but I don&#x27;t know what brand it was. This one comes with an eyebrow trimmer which may be nice for some people.</li>
            <li> My husband just picked this up and really loves it.  It had the Philips Norelco NT8110 Nose and Ear Trimmer before and likes this one even better.  You can completely rinse it, which is a nice feature and it is very gentle when trimming.</li>
            <li> works great but I wish the blade section was longer</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried numerous nose trimmers with little success. Usually, they have not trimmed hairs that are over a millimeter long. Another complaint is that generally they tend to pull hairs frequently, leading to discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit does an outstanding job. It trims cleanly without any pulling. I heartily recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice nose trimmer... Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used, but not liked, several trimmers in the past, including the [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K]] and the [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC]]. Both of these used the rotary top, both were only somewhat effective at actual trimming (with the occasional painful pull), and both died within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Phillips model takes a different approach. Rather than using the rotary top, it cuts along one side of the angled tip. This requires a somewhat different technique to use (you have to rotate the trimmer inside your nose), but ends up being much more effective. It takes roughly a third of the time for me to get the same results as a rotary, with no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top rotates, and this is how you turn it on/off as well as removing the top for battery installation. I&#x27;ve found this to be finicky. A few times the trimmer would not turn on, but removing and re-attaching the top worked, even if it took several tries (yes, it was a fresh battery). The way the blades are arranged also makes it somewhat difficult to trim hairs that hug the side of your nostril, and you can forget using it at all if you have a cold because it will jam, even if you think your nose is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips also comes with some accessories if you want to use it on eyebrows or other fine trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this better than any other nasal trimmer I&#x27;ve used, but I still think there&#x27;s room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Well with age comes hair apparently. This thing is about average for its price range. The vibrating blade can still nick you, so compared to the rotating ones it would require more care before putting it into your nose or ear. The little blade covers are really neat though and work well for eyebrows. But at this price range you can get other similar trimmers with both the vibrating straight blade and the rotating blade.</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared to try this product.  I&#x27;ve never used a nose or ear trimmer before and was worried that it would hurt but even more that I would cut myself up.  I&#x27;m as clumsy as they come, so if it was possible to cut or hurt yourself, I expect I would have found it once I finally got up the courage to try it.  The unit is very light in your hand, too, so it doesn&#x27;t stress even my arthritic shoulders to hold it up for the few seconds it takes to get rid of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe that you could just rinse the trimmer under the faucet to clean it.  Just a great design, all around.</li>
