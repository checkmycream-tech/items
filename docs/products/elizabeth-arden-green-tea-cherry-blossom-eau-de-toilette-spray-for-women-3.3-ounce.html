            <li>The best way to describe it is that it smells like spring.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>Perfect combination!</li>
            <li>but this one is great!</li>
            <li>Perfect gift!</li>

            <li>great fragrance...</li>
            <li>loved the great scent</li>
            <li>I was thrilled and so was she!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice summer fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t stay all day.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it does not smell like candy.</li>
            <li>, I find it&#x27;s more of a body spray as opposed to a cologne.</li>
            <li>Came quickly!</li>
            <li>Love the smell but the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell it is fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>Each of the Green Tea spray are light and delicious...</li>
            <li>I agree; only I believe that to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>wonderful scent, yet remains subtle.</li>
            <li>It was easy to find, the real deal  (not a knock off).</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>When I saw her favorite for more than 50% less than retail</li>
            <li>It helps to put the body lotion on first and then spray over it.</li>
            <li>so I really did not know what to expect!</li>
            <li>It is both youthful and mature, sweet without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>A very nice and subtle fragrance&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazon was smart to make this item non-returnable.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am actually wearing it right now</li>
            <li>It does not resemble anything remotely cherry blossom, but is more like an artificial rose scent buried inside a tea bag for the first 5 minutes, after which it smells like insect repellant.</li>
            <li>usually do not wear perfume as they can be to over-&lt;br /&gt;powering</li>
            <li>fits right in with the other green tea scents.wasn&#x27;t easy to find.</li>
            <li>However, I did like Green Tea, so I thought it was worth a try.</li>

            <li> I was a little unsure about this one, since I had not smelled it before purchase. However, I did like Green Tea, so I thought it was worth a try. I love it! The best way to describe it is that it smells like spring. I also love the fact that it does not smell like candy. It is both youthful and mature, sweet without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> loved the great scent</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! Lovely packaging ! Came quickly! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like all the green tea fragrances from Elizabeth Arden;  I wish they would last a little longer though.  It helps to put the body lotion on first and then spray over it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice summer fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t stay all day.</li>
            <li> great fragrance...Elizabeth Arden is on of my favourite product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it is fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> Perfect combination! A very nice and subtle fragrance&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not wear perfume as they can be to over-&lt;br /&gt;powering but this one is great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but the scent fades quickly. I am actually wearing it right now, I find it&#x27;s more of a body spray as opposed to a cologne.</li>
            <li> I know that fragrances react to the differences in body chemistry, so that could be the problem with this cologne for me. It does not resemble anything remotely cherry blossom, but is more like an artificial rose scent buried inside a tea bag for the first 5 minutes, after which it smells like insect repellant. Others have noted that the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long. I agree; only I believe that to be a good thing. P.S  Amazon was smart to make this item non-returnable.</li>
            <li> Each of the Green Tea spray are light and delicious... the Cherry Blossom is probably one of my favorites though...</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She absolutely loves this fragrance. I was going to buy some ofter fragrances  in a retail store when she told me I could get them on Amazon.  She was right. It was easy to find, the real deal  (not a knock off). When I saw her favorite for more than 50% less than retail I was thrilled and so was she!</li>
            <li> wonderful scent, yet remains subtle. fits right in with the other green tea scents.wasn&#x27;t easy to find. would gladly buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe not what I expected, but then I had never actually smelled perfume before so I really did not know what to expect!</li>
            <li> It very low quality. On top it broken, old package and very dirty. I don&#x27;t like it and unhappy in package.</li>
