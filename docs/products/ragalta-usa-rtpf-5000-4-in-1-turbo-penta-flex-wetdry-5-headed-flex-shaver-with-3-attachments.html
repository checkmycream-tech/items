            <li>Everything came in a very nice box.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Consequently my evaluation may not be fair judgement at this time.</li>
            <li>Gave it to a friend he loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved the price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>it is a good product</li>
            <li>is looks the quality is good</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for more than a month now and it still works great every time I use it.</li>
            <li>It has amazing attachments.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husbnd and he is thrilled with its perforance.</li>
            <li>This was order for my son and he liked the attachments it included.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver.</li>
            <li>was a good deal and with free shipping it was a deal.</li>
            <li>Leaves his skin looking amazing and im in love with the results.</li>
            <li>and I am able to keep up with all my manscaping out here in Afghanistan.</li>
            <li>But if you expect more than that, you&#x27;d better invest more with Norelco.</li>
            <li>Most time have to us while pluged in all though that does always work,,, junk</li>
            <li>Great shave just will not hold a charge will say fully charged but dies in two minutes so must learn to shave fast.</li>
            <li>Cuts better than all the newer Norelco expensesive shavers.</li>
            <li>I would buy more if I can find them.</li>
            <li>I have always used Norelco (Tried many other Brands), and thought Norelco was the Best by a Country Mile.</li>
            <li>This shaver has features attractive for a frequent traveler.</li>
            <li>Gave up; bought a Norelco and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>not for you, but the machine came with flaws to light because of this</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a good buy at the current price, I actuallywould have paid more if I&#x27;d known it was built so well and worked so well.  </li>
            <li>His face is smooth and clean after a shave and has no cuts of nicks from the shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, for what I paid, good product.</li>
            <li>I only asked for one replacement because I assumed it would arrive with a good toothbrush adapter and power cord.</li>
            <li>One works great, the other one won&#x27;t stay on and will not charge correctly.</li>
            <li>The product worked fine for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>The charge time is quick but the razor runs out after three shaves.</li>
            <li>This shaver is surprisingly high quality, built very well, looks nice, and even came with a travel case.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, easy, clean shaving and the charge last for a while.</li>
            <li>old)It gives him a smooth face and the four heads move gently over his skin.  </li>
            <li>, this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>My old razor did better than this one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than my old Norelco, but maybe with time we&#x27;ll adapt better.</li>
            <li>It holds a long charge and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Razer was shipped right a way.</li>
            <li>I suggest you pay a little more to get a better brand name device.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to change to a different attachment.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it to shave (I used shaving cream since this is a wet/dry shaver)</li>
            <li>My shave routine is: use trimmer first if hair is over 1/8\\&quot;, then electric shaver, and sometimes finish with a blade.  </li>
            <li>but I was willing to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>first shaver wouldn&#x27;t even turn on, Had to pay shipping to return it for another.</li>
            <li>Pretty close shave, of course no shaver will ever shave as close as I want it.</li>
            <li>Haband offered the 4000 model for a higher price than the 5000 turbo.</li>
            <li>I works just as well as those shavers that cost 3X as much.</li>
            <li>Does not give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I returned the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Best cutting shaver I ever owned.</li>
            <li>But I figured if it did not shave well then at least I would gain a good nose/ear hair trimmer and a body shaver since it also includes these attachments.  </li>
            <li>The only downside this shaver has is shared among all electric shavers; you will sometimes need to finish up your shave with a quick use of a blade, because nothing shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>If you need a low cost electric shaver that does adequate task, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>To end on a positive note, I experienced absolutely no electric razor burn or irritation from using this shaver; during wet or dry use.  </li>
            <li>when I use it to wet shaver, I get a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>was something new that I now like.</li>
            <li>So I figured I would just get a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>Ended up exchanging for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Then twist the center head off to clean.</li>
            <li>Second shaver was just as defective as the first.</li>
            <li>But then I realized it has a low geared high torque motor that easily mowed down my stubble.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the nose hair trimmer and found that it cuts well and so far has not pinched me.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this.  </li>
            <li>Got a great price for this shaver ($ 36.35), I looked at the reviews before buying it and halve of them where good and the other halve bad, I took the risk anyway and the performance was pretty bad, I gave it some days of testing, but the shaver wasn&#x27;t good and it took me a long time shaving (more than my old shavers) to get a mediocre result.</li>
            <li>the attachments are cool although i was a little weary about brushing my teeth with something i shave with....</li>
            <li>The second razor did the same thing only it would run for about 45 seconds before the red light came on.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have read listened to half of the reviews the first time!</li>
            <li>OPEN BOX/ NEW DAMAGE)</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at the results because the motor does not sound powerful.  </li>
            <li>It ran for about 15 seconds than the red light began flashing indicating a dead battery.</li>
            <li>Received the first one and spent several days trying to get it charged.  </li>
            <li>as far as the reviews say this product could be good or bad.  </li>
            <li>Have to pull up each of the four outside rotary heads on a pivot then clean with small brush and blow the loose hairs away.</li>

            <li> Very low power took a long time to shave and now 6mos.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product that long.</li>
            <li> I brought 1 of these shavers long x ago  </li>
            <li> It was a poorly built razor, and I had to go over the same area of my face several times to get a halfway decent shave.  </li>
            <li> So much for so cheap, I figured that the product itself must be of pore quality or the motor is going to crap out...</li>
            <li> Ive had the thing for several months now and compared to the several Remington and Phillips I have had in the past</li>
            <li> First off I was a bit skeptical because of the low price and the unknown brand</li>
            <li> Both wwere gifts for my twin teenage boys who just started shaving, it really sucks to have to send one back.</li>
            <li> The tabs that attach the center head to the razor cracked off.</li>
            <li> He charged it according to the directions twice and both times it only worked for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other shavers before that cost over $100</li>
            <li> One thing that was not mentioned is that this shaver also has a small pop-up trimmer built-in; it is on the back of the shaver, to be used for trimming up your mustache if you have one.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, the price range for other flex-head razors is always 3 digits and up $100</li>
            <li> I used other products but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother ordering another one after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Going over the same area multiple time ended up irritating my face.</li>
            <li> Not worth trying again.</li>
            <li> I figured there is no way this thing is going to cut the hair on my face without bogging down.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I can never start my shave with a blade because my facial hair is too tough.  </li>
            <li> Again, I have really tough facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Product stopped charging efficiently after a few months.</li>
            <li> The worse part the battery went out after only four months.</li>
            <li> The replacement arrived about five days after I ordered it but was missing the toothbrush adapter.</li>
            <li> I am tired of writing what other knows already, so I am just going to cut and paste this version of exciting comment and review to everyone to read and gets the same boring imagination.</li>
            <li> I have very tough facial hair so after hearing the motor run</li>
            <li> Delivery was just a day late</li>
            <li> I usually shave once and place back on charging base.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was a weak motor and therefore a budget shaver.  </li>
            <li> One of the others had a broken tooth brush adapter.</li>

            <li> Rma in progress. Hope it was just a one and a million and not a trend. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Hope you don&#x27;t have the same experience.</li>
            <li> But I figured if it did not shave well then at least I would gain a good nose/ear hair trimmer and a body shaver since it also includes these attachments.  But to my amazement it does shave well!  When I first used it to shave (I used shaving cream since this is a wet/dry shaver) it felt like it was not doing anything, but then I looked and the hair was gone.  I was really surprised at the results because the motor does not sound powerful.  I assumed it was a weak motor and therefore a budget shaver.  I have very tough facial hair so after hearing the motor run I figured there is no way this thing is going to cut the hair on my face without bogging down.  I&#x27;ve purchased other shavers before that cost over $100 and they had a 13,000 RPM motor that could not handle my facial hair.  But then I realized it has a low geared high torque motor that easily mowed down my stubble.  I also tried the nose hair trimmer and found that it cuts well and so far has not pinched me.  Lastly I tried what I think is the body hair trimmer attachment and that worked well also.  This shaver is surprisingly high quality, built very well, looks nice, and even came with a travel case.  One thing that was not mentioned is that this shaver also has a small pop-up trimmer built-in; it is on the back of the shaver, to be used for trimming up your mustache if you have one.  The only downside this shaver has is shared among all electric shavers; you will sometimes need to finish up your shave with a quick use of a blade, because nothing shaves as close as a blade.  I can never start my shave with a blade because my facial hair is too tough.  My shave routine is: use trimmer first if hair is over 1/8\\&quot;, then electric shaver, and sometimes finish with a blade.  Again, I have really tough facial hair.  To end on a positive note, I experienced absolutely no electric razor burn or irritation from using this shaver; during wet or dry use.  In my opinion this is a good buy at the current price, I actuallywould have paid more if I&#x27;d known it was built so well and worked so well.  This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Razer was shipped right a way. was a good deal and with free shipping it was a deal. good shave, like the nose hair clipper!</li>
            <li> For the money I am very happy with this purchase. It is not the closest shave but it is by far not the worst. The trimming accessories work great and I am able to keep up with all my manscaping out here in Afghanistan. Definiately a must for the deploying soldier.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, the price range for other flex-head razors is always 3 digits and up $100+. After receiving the item and unpacking everything, comes with a lot of extras and add-ons, my earlier skepticism grew. So much for so cheap, I figured that the product itself must be of pore quality or the motor is going to crap out...etc. Ive had the thing for several months now and compared to the several Remington and Phillips I have had in the past, this is my favorite so far. Smooth, easy, clean shaving and the charge last for a while. I like the attachments and the dry/wet use was something new that I now like. Overall, for what I paid, good product. Even if the razor only lasts hopefully a year, I&#x27;ll be buying another when it does go.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husbnd and he is thrilled with its perforance. He says it is the best shaver he has ever had. (he is 81Yrs. old)It gives him a smooth face and the four heads move gently over his skin.  He  also likes the tooth brush, he did not expect it to be great but it is!</li>
            <li> Product stopped charging efficiently after a few months. Now the charge will only last 5 minutes. I no longer use this product. I suggest you pay a little more to get a better brand name device. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor through Amazon in June of this year.  It was a poorly built razor, and I had to go over the same area of my face several times to get a halfway decent shave.  The worse part the battery went out after only four months. What I get for purchasing an off-brand product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he was amazed at the attachments he can use when he travels such as the toothbrush. His face is smooth and clean after a shave and has no cuts of nicks from the shave. Great product - I&#x27;m going to get another for my brother</li>
            <li> This shaver has features attractive for a frequent traveler. It performed as well as the price, but it does not give the close shaving. It also does not have universal voltage adapter for battery charging, i.e., 220 volt, for traveling out of the U.S. If you need a low cost electric shaver that does adequate task, I recommend this. But if you expect more than that, you&#x27;d better invest more with Norelco.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver while over seas. My Remington screen razor got a hole in the screen. So I figured I would just get a new electric razor. I didn&#x27;t want a screen because they always seem to get holes in them at inopertune times. I was looking at the Norelco razors when I found the Ragalta Turbo. Everything came in a very nice box. I was happy with the way the Ragalta was put together. Didn&#x27;t feel cheap. The attachments are great. Except the razor part. It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to shave my face. I have to spend time going over the same area multiple times and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to get a decent shave. Going over the same area multiple time ended up irritating my face. I would pass and get a time tested razer. I&#x27;m kicking myself now.</li>
            <li> Works great, close shave.  It holds a long charge and is very easy to clean.  Quick and easy to change to a different attachment.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor for 2 weeks.  It did not have a close shave.  My old razor did better than this one. I had to go over the same spot over and over and it still didn&#x27;t do the job.  I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> First off I was a bit skeptical because of the low price and the unknown brand but I was willing to give it a chance. Boy was I happy that I did. This happens to have been one of the best purchases that I have made year to date. I works just as well as those shavers that cost 3X as much. A great buy in my book.</li>
            <li> This product is great i bought this for my fiancee and he looks it it gives him a close shave. Leaves his skin looking amazing and im in love with the results. He loves using it all the time, and its the best gift i could have gave him ever. Wish i would of found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product that long. Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than my old Norelco, but maybe with time we&#x27;ll adapt better. Consequently my evaluation may not be fair judgement at this time. I would like to comment at a later date</li>
            <li> This product is so so. Not the best but also not the worst. Does not give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Gave it to a friend he loved it. Awesome Product for the price. Still working today but he just lost the cord so he&#x27;s SOOL</li>
            <li> first shaver wouldn&#x27;t even turn on, Had to pay shipping to return it for another. Second shaver was just as defective as the first. Gave up; bought a Norelco and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The tabs that attach the center head to the razor cracked off. The razor is now useless. The charge time is quick but the razor runs out after three shaves. Not recommended,</li>
            <li> This was order for my son and he liked the attachments it included. It arrived in a timely matter. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this as an anniversary gift and it didn&#x27;t work! The battery would say it was fully charged so we turned it on. It ran for about 15 seconds than the red light began flashing indicating a dead battery. I got a replacement and figured it was just faulty. The second razor did the same thing only it would run for about 45 seconds before the red light came on. Wish I would have read listened to half of the reviews the first time!</li>
            <li> Open it, used it, packed it back up and sent it back for a refund. Tore the %$#@ out of my face! Don&#x27;t buy unless you have a solid leather face.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am happy using it all the time. It has amazing attachments.  I used other products but when I use it to wet shaver, I get a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> Got a great price for this shaver ($ 36.35), I looked at the reviews before buying it and halve of them where good and the other halve bad, I took the risk anyway and the performance was pretty bad, I gave it some days of testing, but the shaver wasn&#x27;t good and it took me a long time shaving (more than my old shavers) to get a mediocre result. The hair clipper from the back worked one time, the next day it didn&#x27;t shave anymore. One of the attachments is a bigger hair clipper, it didn&#x27;t shave anything... I couln&#x27;t believe it. I didn&#x27;t try the teeth brush attachment, so I don&#x27;t know how it works. I returned the whole thing. Stay away...</li>
            <li> Received the first one and spent several days trying to get it charged.  Ended up exchanging for a new one.  Received second one and same thing.  Returning the second for a refund.  Not worth trying again.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver. Pretty close shave, of course no shaver will ever shave as close as I want it. I expecially like the  moustache trimmer which I use as a hair trimmer. Also has a toothbrush attachment, which I havn&#x27;t tried as of yet. Only downside is cleaning. Have to pull up each of the four outside rotary heads on a pivot then clean with small brush and blow the loose hairs away. Then twist the center head off to clean. Battery may stay up for 2 shaves. I usually shave once and place back on charging base. Loved the price through Amazon. Haband offered the 4000 model for a higher price than the 5000 turbo. But, whenever I see something on sale, I always look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> as far as the reviews say this product could be good or bad.  Well mine was awesome holds a charge for over a week (and i am in the army so i have to shave every day) the attachments are cool although i was a little weary about brushing my teeth with something i shave with.... but still my experience with this product has been very good.</li>
            <li> I am tired of writing what other knows already, so I am just going to cut and paste this version of exciting comment and review to everyone to read and gets the same boring imagination. Yea! Goog! wove it</li>
            <li> When i received it  it had no wrapper on it then i looked on the box it say,(NEW OPEN BOX/ NEW DAMAGE)... how does this happen, is there any QUALITY CONTROL  in this country....I brought 1 of these shavers long x ago  w/ no problems it was great till i burned out the motor.  John B.  ps; i will find another w/o AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li> Delivery was just a day late eventhough I used my AmazonPrime. All parts were included; however, once charged to 100% and unplugged, the razor would immediately die and then not hold a charge. I would like to return this product ASAP, and either receive a replacement or refund.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works good it is a good product and I like the way is looks the quality is good I would recommend this to anybody vDnYBamm</li>
            <li> The only thing that shaves as close as a razor is another razor. That being said, using this in the shower provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever received from an electric shaver. I&#x27;ve never wet-shaved with an electric before, so maybe that made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered three of these for Christmas, one for me &amp; one for each of girlfriend&#x27;s kids. Mine had a defective power adapter. One of the others had a broken tooth brush adapter. I only asked for one replacement because I assumed it would arrive with a good toothbrush adapter and power cord. The replacement arrived about five days after I ordered it but was missing the toothbrush adapter.</li>
            <li> Very low power took a long time to shave and now 6mos. later it will not hold a charge.Most time have to us while pluged in all though that does always work,,, junk</li>
            <li> The product worked fine for the first couple of months. I had to buy one replacement head the 2nd month and another one the f4th month. Finally the shaver stopped working the 6th month.</li>
            <li> not for you, but the machine came with flaws to light because of this I had to take it to a technician for the review and realized it had a burnt wire inside so I did not like their service</li>
            <li> It is a very bad machine. Never started. All of it is wrong. I hate it. They never return to me my money.</li>
            <li> Great shave just will not hold a charge will say fully charged but dies in two minutes so must learn to shave fast.</li>
            <li> I followed the manual; as always. Always said to charge, never, never, never worked. Kept saying to recharge, after 3 attempts I returned it.  Did some research online, tons of individuals had the same problem. Don&#x27;t buy; they wont even turn on.</li>
            <li> Best cutting shaver I ever owned. Cuts better than all the newer Norelco expensesive shavers. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last that long. Stops working within three years. I have three and my last one is still in the box. I also use it for my head to give me a close shave. I would buy more if I can find them.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver on the market, and BEST Price. I have always used Norelco (Tried many other Brands), and thought Norelco was the Best by a Country Mile. Regalta is BETTER!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He charged it according to the directions twice and both times it only worked for a few seconds.  I didn&#x27;t even bother ordering another one after reading other reviews.  I had my son pick the one he wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for more than a month now and it still works great every time I use it. The toothbrush attachment doesn&#x27;t work well but it was not the reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Opened package read charging instructions charged to what the instructions stated. never worked. got another one because I thought it might have been a fluke thing. The next one was the same thing but would run for 4 seconds then done.</li>
            <li> One works great, the other one won&#x27;t stay on and will not charge correctly. The thing turns off every 4 seconds.  Both wwere gifts for my twin teenage boys who just started shaving, it really sucks to have to send one back.</li>
