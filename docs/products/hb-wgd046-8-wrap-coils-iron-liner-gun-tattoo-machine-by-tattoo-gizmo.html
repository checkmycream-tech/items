            <li>This tattoo machine is very beautiful as far as machines go.</li>
            <li>your gonna love it</li>
            <li>and i have to say it may be better for shading.</li>
            <li>I think as a shader the range of voltage would be more fitting as well.</li>
            <li>I will probably replace the bar and the spring for a better lining setup because i really do love the weight of this when i am trying to get more control with my lines.</li>
            <li>I love it for a beginner machine, it performs a lot better that</li>
            <li>This is one of the best low price gun I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I am IN Love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten three tattoos from this thing, and they look pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, Thank YOU VERY, much.</li>
            <li>and i did my first line work came out smooth very please thanks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have fun and amazing work with this machine ...</li>
            <li>The coils are really strong and consistant with no sign of heating up.</li>
            <li>If that is not for you then the other great thing about this machine is that it is very light weight, which i love for lining.</li>
            <li>Got this machine super fast great packaging, the frame is great but the capacitor is faulty and needs to be changed other than that</li>
            <li>The machine is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Everything went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>but what surprised me is that it works really good.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easy to dial in your sweet spot.</li>
            <li>The only thing im changing is the nylon screw otherwise very nice</li>
            <li>its seems ok, pretty good for the price especially if you are looking for a frame</li>
            <li>It is very sexy but the frames color effect was different.</li>
            <li>Light  and very well built and put together.</li>
            <li>My favorite machine by far.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the clamp,</li>
            <li>Put it this way, for as inexpensive as these machines are, the coils and hardware alone are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Right now i have this setup for a liner</li>
            <li>Price was just right</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Highly recommended\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s pretty durable.</li>
            <li>was easy to tune and doesn&#x27;t rattle itself out of tune like some other cheap&#x27;os.</li>
            <li>Originally was not happy with my delivery but they made good on the issues I had with the seller.</li>
            <li>I still believe this is a solid machine, would buy again for someone looking to start on the cheap.</li>
            <li>it has a light blue swirled into the purple metallic finish.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner, and I may not know TOO, too much.</li>
            <li>Its really just a \\&quot;one -pass\\&quot; liner .  </li>
            <li>no adjustments needed ready to go</li>
            <li>The frame was a really washed out brown and</li>
            <li>the design lines were like a washed out gray and it was really dotty at some spots.</li>
            <li>The bar on this is fairly light weight as well, which i do not particularly care for.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone just starting out and wanting to learn a little about tattooing and for the price I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Even if it dies in a year you get your monies&#x27; worth, i feel it&#x27;ll work well for longer with proper TLC.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a few more soon.</li>
            <li>I am new at tattooing and don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge about the machines</li>
            <li>i thought i was going to have to get new parts for it just to make it run the way i like it</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected, works very well the company it self sells other good products that I purchased.</li>
            <li>waited a couple weeks to post this review to really get a chance to use the machine as much as possible and to push it to its limit.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>all together but overall very crappy.</li>
            <li>but I prefer this one by far and</li>
            <li>The frame I received was a light blue grey with white speckles and had a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I really like this machine and plan to use it for the long term.</li>
            <li>and I can get my money back or a new machine</li>
            <li>The frame feels solid,  only real issue is with the coils.</li>
            <li>So very pleasantly surprised overall.</li>
            <li>After minor adjustments, this thing is can color pack or soft shade at 5volts on a hurricane power supply.</li>

            <li> Comparable to my other more expensive machines.</li>
            <li> As a liner the usable voltage kinda tops out a little early.</li>
            <li> Out of the box I was a little bit surprised with the finish of the frame.</li>
            <li> As far as a lining machine goes I did switch the front spring out for a little bit of a shorter spring.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very small machine just got it for the frame.</li>
            <li> unlike  some other people that purchased this machine I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with coil heat so far.</li>
            <li> Crispy Lines , takes a few days of Use to break it in but works Solid !</li>
            <li> Reading through some of the other reviews it appears it comes in a wide variety as well as a metallic finish also.</li>
            <li> what the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I have about 12 other guns</li>
            <li> I do have one other liner</li>
            <li> The design was less wood cooler and the lines were not pretty like this pic.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe it&#x27;s the same finish.</li>
            <li> i buy this machines so my little brothers can practice with them</li>
            <li> but the only con is its real small</li>
            <li> Update a few pieces</li>
            <li> , i run my machines with definite on or off, not momentary, so heating can be an issue with poorly made machines.</li>
            <li> Also came on time like  usual</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t even recomend this to a beginner its complete crap</li>
            <li> and it was game over.</li>
            <li> Useless piece of junk</li>
            <li> You cant really go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t show pics of a product and send people the wrong design of the product.</li>
            <li> Junk fake copper coils</li>
            <li> I want to thank crazy cart for fixing issues I had with my shipment.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, the frames weren&#x27;t so bad either.</li>

            <li> This machine is a beast, for a rather inexpensive gun it&#x27;s definitely a good one, works great, was easy to tune and doesn&#x27;t rattle itself out of tune like some other cheap&#x27;os. My favorite machine by far.</li>
            <li> Beginners gun, good weight though</li>
            <li> Cant ask for better, Everything about it is great  Light  and very well built and put together. The only thing im changing is the nylon screw otherwise very nice buy it your gonna love it</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected, works very well the company it self sells other good products that I purchased. I loved the design to but does what it suppose to</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very small machine just got it for the frame.</li>
            <li> Vice will not grip barrell</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the clamp, but, it does it&#x27;s job. The machine is fantastic. The finish is much different in person. Hard to believe it&#x27;s the same finish. But, still nice.</li>
            <li> Crispy Lines , takes a few days of Use to break it in but works Solid !</li>
            <li> Comparable to my other more expensive machines. waited a couple weeks to post this review to really get a chance to use the machine as much as possible and to push it to its limit. I still believe this is a solid machine, would buy again for someone looking to start on the cheap.</li>
            <li> This tattoo machine is very beautiful as far as machines go. it has a light blue swirled into the purple metallic finish. If that is not for you then the other great thing about this machine is that it is very light weight, which i love for lining. The bar on this is fairly light weight as well, which i do not particularly care for. Right now i have this setup for a liner and i have to say it may be better for shading. I think as a shader the range of voltage would be more fitting as well. As a liner the usable voltage kinda tops out a little early. I will probably replace the bar and the spring for a better lining setup because i really do love the weight of this when i am trying to get more control with my lines. Also thought the wing nut on the side of the clamp would be plastic (and therefore needed to be replaced) from all the images i saw, it turned out to be metal. So very pleasantly surprised overall.</li>
            <li> For a 15 dollar tattoo gun, this thing actually does the job well. I&#x27;ve gotten three tattoos from this thing, and they look pretty good. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great starter device or backup machine. I was surprised</li>
            <li> I want to thank crazy cart for fixing issues I had with my shipment. Originally was not happy with my delivery but they made good on the issues I had with the seller. Thank u</li>
            <li> I love it for a beginner machine, it performs a lot better that what the other reviews say. Also came on time like  usual</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Thanks it sounds great right out of the box, recommend it to anybody that needs a good machine!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I started it up it sent out a ton of sparks and then stopped working. I ran it for 1 second and it was game over. I&#x27;m hoping it was just a defect and I can get my money back or a new machine all together but overall very crappy. I have about 12 other guns and I wouldn&#x27;t even recomend this to a beginner its complete crap</li>
            <li> Useless piece of junk, I knew that when I bought it though,more of a novelty item than anything else,if you do buy one of these,please don&#x27;t use it on humans for tattoos...</li>
            <li> It broke within the 1st hour i was using it. I could of course repair, but it is definitely a lesson learned. Do nut buy unless you yourself know how to fix a machine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best low price gun I have ever bought. After tuning it in and some adjustments this gun runs like a $150 gun. I use it as a liner when I need to run 5 to 9 liner needle. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Put it this way, for as inexpensive as these machines are, the coils and hardware alone are worth the purchase. But to my surprise, the frames weren&#x27;t so bad either. You cant really go wrong for the price. Great communication. Overall I was satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am IN Love. Nuff said. I&#x27;m a beginner, and I may not know TOO, too much. But I know a werking machine, and this is it. It&#x27;s beautiful and runs AWEmayzingly!! And?! It got here within the week I ordered it! Very pleased, Thank YOU VERY, much.</li>
            <li> Works great. Looks great.</li>
            <li> Really good for the price... Update a few pieces and you&#x27;ve got a nice machine for 1/3 the cost...</li>
            <li> Price was just right and it is quality is excellent!!! If you are looking for a good one,this is it!</li>
            <li> I am new at tattooing and don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge about the machines but I am learning. Out of the box I was a little bit surprised with the finish of the frame. The frame I received was a light blue grey with white speckles and had a matte finish. Reading through some of the other reviews it appears it comes in a wide variety as well as a metallic finish also. One thing I did like about this machine was the weight and that the wing nut on the side of the clamp wasn&#x27;t plastic. As far as a lining machine goes I did switch the front spring out for a little bit of a shorter spring. Other than that it just needs a little tuning and is ready to run. I do have one other liner but I prefer this one by far and unlike  some other people that purchased this machine I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with coil heat so far. I would recommend this to anyone just starting out and wanting to learn a little about tattooing and for the price I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly.  Received my package ahead of schedule!</li>

            <li> Good machine for the price...</li>
            <li> I just received my HB liner tattoo machine . And , its amazing one of the best i have brought on amazon for that price . Its really just a \\&quot;one -pass\\&quot; liner .  You&#x27;ll have fun and amazing work with this machine ... \\&quot;Highly recommended\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> item came fully wrap good no damages the machine is really good no adjustments needed ready to go i let ran for about good 30 mins to break it in and i did my first line work came out smooth very please thanks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this machine super fast great packaging, the frame is great but the capacitor is faulty and needs to be changed other than that its seems ok, pretty good for the price especially if you are looking for a frame</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  The frame feels solid,  only real issue is with the coils. There seems to be a short. Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> this is a good tattoo machine for the price. i like the design but what surprised me is that it works really good. i thought i was going to have to get new parts for it just to make it run the way i like it but it turns out i dint have to. i buy this machines so my little brothers can practice with them</li>
            <li> this tattoo machine needed basic set up out of the box. After minor adjustments, this thing is can color pack or soft shade at 5volts on a hurricane power supply. It has a plastc-molded-over brass wingnut (tube vise). However it&#x27;s pretty durable. Alloy frame seems non magnetic, not too heavy at all, and springs are very bouncy. So it&#x27;s easy to dial in your sweet spot. The coils are really strong and consistant with no sign of heating up. mind you, i run my machines with definite on or off, not momentary, so heating can be an issue with poorly made machines. So, final verdict: Even if it dies in a year you get your monies&#x27; worth, i feel it&#x27;ll work well for longer with proper TLC. I&#x27;ll be buying a few more soon.</li>
            <li> It is very sexy but the frames color effect was different. The design was less wood cooler and the lines were not pretty like this pic. The frame was a really washed out brown and the design lines were like a washed out gray and it was really dotty at some spots. I didn&#x27;t like this part. But the coils were beautiful. Don&#x27;t show pics of a product and send people the wrong design of the product.</li>
            <li> The color of this is so beautiful and the machine works wonderful I really like this machine and plan to use it for the long term.</li>
            <li> Junk fake copper coils</li>
            <li> works great, it powered thru a 2 hour session with out stopping or anything . but the only con is its real small</li>
