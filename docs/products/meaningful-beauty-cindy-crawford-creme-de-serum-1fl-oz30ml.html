            <li>Lightweight and smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Cindy Crawford and your amazing team!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to wake up after using this product and you see your skin looking more youthful.</li>
            <li>This is the best of Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the best line ...</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so nice!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t depend on what others say, for your own health&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied with the effects although i find i need a good moisturizer over it for the best effect.</li>
            <li>For some reason it does not work as good together</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>At 60, surprising to get compliments on my skin</li>
            <li>Her face was looking good.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a wonderful, light scent.</li>
            <li>but i think the night cream works great on its own.</li>
            <li>Go hide under a rock and mix your skincare outta your nuts and trees and see how good you look , go to wholefoods and buy your antiaging and shutup,,</li>
            <li>Since she always looks good and is picky as to what she wears, I am assuming that it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, like Petroleum jelly, and dries to a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Philosophy and DDF for my skincare.</li>
            <li>The product has a good feel and does not feel &#x27;oily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing though.</li>
            <li>I think  it is good moisturize.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>Feels so good on your face.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>good luck trying to get it all sorted out.</li>
            <li>So I decided to look on Amazon.com to find just the serum and found it at a good price.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone, oily, fair skin for reference.</li>
            <li>I look good.</li>
            <li>It does feel good when going on.</li>
            <li>Glad I had the discount price and the glow is beautiful on the face.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and how quickly it arrived</li>
            <li>But i loved this serum the most!</li>
            <li>Very happy with it and Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is magic, great results</li>
            <li>I want to spread the joy--I am very pleased the way my skin has responded to this serum.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so so happy and can&#x27;t wait to see more.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Have ordered more than once!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin top notch all day!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, savings through Amazon is amazing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and I really really love it!</li>
            <li>First of all, This skin care line- products are not organic in any way!!!!  </li>
            <li>The seller was very good about getting my product to me safely and fast, thank you!!!</li>
            <li>But this is just amazing.</li>
            <li>She had used it for a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Well let me say this is an amazing product</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve always had amazing skin.</li>
            <li>This serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>Creme de Serum is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>But the creme de serum, neck cream, both eye creams and wrinkle caps were amazing.</li>
            <li>but it  does feel good on skin but need more time to see if it makes a difference in smoothing and firming.</li>
            <li>Also, this product has greatly reduced my &amp;#34;parentheses&amp;#34; and for that I am most grateful -- even more than the reduction in the reddening.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you do your own research before trying this product.</li>
            <li>nice and silky-----never want to use anything else</li>
            <li>However, the smell of the product is really nice.</li>
            <li>I came home and purchased my own.</li>
            <li>but it will make your skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li>You really feel like you are giving your skin the best.  </li>
            <li>Best way to describe it is a new vinyl shower curtain, placed in the microwave and melted.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing in the whole Meaningful Beauty set and it is cheaper than buying from the source.</li>
            <li>Love the product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>If someone has never used professional skin care I can see why they may be impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>feels good and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The first time you put it on, your skin is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
            <li>I might as well have been using Oil of Olay, which I liked better than this product.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the original offer products, this one worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Love love love my Skin has NEVER felt so GOOD :)</li>
            <li>I would say it is a good moisturizing agent, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the $30/ounce!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very smooth</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin very smooth and it has diminished lines  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used on my face and it really does exactly what it claims, my skin feels and looks amazing :)</li>
            <li>I love Cindy but not her products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with canceling a monthly subscription.</li>
            <li>I bought it off the meaningful beauty site,i used the cleanser and this serum more then anything and after about three weeks folks started asking me if i had make up on,lol</li>
            <li>and I ask her what she is wearing because she skin unbelievably healthy, honestly.thought shed discovered airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I was using it 2x a day instead of once a day.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but the serum works better than those two...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just love how it makes my skin feel and does not have any tingling that burns my rosacea skin or makes my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>I have used it before I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>NO WHERE on the meaningful beauty website do they dare share the list.  </li>
            <li>I see many more ingredients which are too.  </li>
            <li>Message to Meaningful</li>
            <li>Just put the melon in, maybe add some safe conditioning products and keep your customers safe from toxic yuck?</li>
            <li>And since I have used this for many years can confirm this is an authentic product from Meaningful Beauty line.</li>
            <li>this product is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It is light but effective....</li>
            <li>THX LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of my skin when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it makes my face and neck feel.</li>
            <li>I  would buy it more often.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s Creme de Serum.  </li>

            <li>My eyes look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I love this .</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my favorite out of her skin care line ...</li>
            <li>Better deal than their website ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>I might give it one more</li>
            <li>I buy from Amazon  to avoid the Meaningful Beauty auto ship.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lasts forever, I buy it twice a year, so I don&#x27;t need to pay the $50 a month to have orders from the Meaningful Beauty site.</li>
            <li>Love love love how my skin feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels and looks much better, I would recommend this to everyone over 50 or under</li>
            <li>* Softens pores and adds a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Softens pores and adds a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t sure how&#x27;d I feel about this.  </li>
            <li>I have never heard of anybody getting cancer after using products from the Meaningful Beauty Line.</li>
            <li>I intend to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love thus product and what it does for your skin</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love Creme De Serum.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have used many a product in my day.</li>
            <li>I add more to this review</li>
            <li>since it was top seller in the line.</li>
            <li>Some of the top skin serums at Sephora don&#x27;t even measure up.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will purchase it again</li>
            <li>The longer I use the product the better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>chemicals and more chemicals.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the chance to tell her that I use Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM.</li>
            <li>Both products, CrÃ¨me De Serum and Meaningful Beauty Lifting Eye Creme are satisfactory although I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on my face or eyes.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;ve tried better.</li>
            <li>The serum helps with the crows feet and my makeup stays better without all the facal oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Meaningful Beauty works well.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product, but after 2 months using it, I have seen no difference.</li>
            <li>I am just glad I didn&#x27;t sign up for the monthly delivery of the products.</li>
            <li>I love the way this moisterizer maks</li>
            <li>I would rate it a 5 star if it were more like $20 and not $35.</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of stuff from the doctor, more creams, and more exfoliants...</li>
            <li>I love the creme de serum.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, been using it for years and my skin is sensitive, and leaves it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>They love to send out additional product AND charge your credit card over and over and</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware of ordering through the meaningful beauty web site.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the meaningful beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist even noticed my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>BUYER BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Meaningful Beauty 0 stars if I could since 1 is even a stretch.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a guy I&#x27;ve had a chance to recognize most if not all before pictures of actors are shown with no makeup v. the after pictures of actors wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>One would think for the cost, these would be safe for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall extremely happy with this serum!</li>
            <li>I use the product and love it,it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see results in 2 weeks, I&#x27;m on to the next latest and greatest thing.</li>
            <li>I have never had such great customer service - EVER!  </li>
            <li>Found it interesting that on the US website, ingredients are NOT listed, but when I googled CCMB ingredients, they came up on the Scandenavian website.  </li>
            <li>Seems like the authentic Cindy Crawford product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the CrÃ¨me De Serum....</li>
            <li>I love this serum</li>
            <li>I love this anti-aging.  </li>
            <li>Love this .</li>
            <li>I started with a trial of Meaningful Beauty and then found out I would be paying a lot of $$$$$ per month.</li>
            <li>I love her products but do not use them all.</li>
            <li>I will order all my Meaningful Beauty this way.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more vials of this  but cancelled the order</li>
            <li>Use vasoline for better result.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>If this stuff is safe, why does everything I use that has it listed in the top four ingredients</li>
            <li>I love all of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Yes, here we go again another celebrity trying to make more money, but as she spoke</li>
            <li>ITEM IS HIGH QUALITY GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li>I think this is going to be a great product in my arsenal to keep looking as young as I can!!</li>
            <li>This would be great for normal and oily skin.</li>
            <li>The cream makes my face soft , beautiful and radiant in the morning.</li>
            <li>Staying young and beautiful is every woman&#x27;s dream.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels so smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>, Meaningful beauty will not help fine lines or wrinkles PEROID.</li>
            <li>people, it does, and it&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum -- a product I received free from Influenster.</li>
            <li>You can get great deals on Amazon rather than buying complete kits of things you don&#x27;t use from their website.  </li>
            <li>nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>If you have a great ingredient like the melon you mention in the commercial, why ruin it with so many yuck ingredients??</li>
            <li>, it was too strong.</li>
            <li>Felt good on skin but did nothing older women need a stronger product to get any noticeable results .</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels really nice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum had brightened my face smoothed fine lines and shrunk my pores.</li>
            <li>Reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re set up with auto shipments - which is fine.  </li>
            <li>I was using this serum for 6 months and had a noticeable difference in fine lines and skin softness.</li>
            <li>I have seen an improvement in fine lines and</li>
            <li>Its smooth and goes on nicely but the one i bought on amazon smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li>My acne and the spots that seemed to scar where volcanic pimples once stood are quickly disappearing if not completly gone!</li>
            <li>quickly disappearing if not completly gone!</li>
            <li>Better than advertised, arrived quickly, well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good product, the skin is very soft and you see the difference .</li>
            <li>My skin is so wonderful I hardly need this :).</li>
            <li>I thought since they were promoting the magic ingredient to be a melon that I would take the chance on the fact it might actually be a nice natural product.</li>
            <li>Just after a month I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My pores were huge.</li>
            <li>Leaves face smooth.</li>
            <li>Its so smooth</li>
            <li>then smooth skin in those spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So, that is one thing that the serum is fantastic for.  </li>
            <li>At 40 that&#x27;s important ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I use it every morning after I wash my face and it feels smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>this Creme De Serum is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The pay was meh, but they tried to make up with that with a gift bag filled with stuff and</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone, fantastic skin care</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>It feels so wonderful on your skin and its not oily or heavy.</li>
            <li>-you for making the product available here</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the results for this serum because I&#x27;m using this more for maintenance and prevention of wrinkles and skin damage, but I must say, I love the feel.  </li>
            <li>so far so good....</li>
            <li>/&gt;MeaningfulBeauty.com boasts, \\&quot;Combining the power of a serum with the rich, moisturizing effects of a cr&amp;egrave;me, this super-boost is designed to help protect, increase hydration and prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I have allergies and definitely can&#x27;t use scented products so this is great!</li>
            <li>The Only thing I&#x27;ve Ever found on the market that keeps my skins healthy and blemish free!!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten into this nightly ritual of coming home from work, washing my face with a steamy hot washcloth, then putting on my Creme de Serum, followed by the Meaningful Beauty Night Cream just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I cannot determine that there has been any significant change in moisture retention, firmness or improved appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>the original ad for this at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of all the Meaningful Beauty products but this one I love!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>But I fell in love with this product the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>so I opted for meaningful Beauty first.</li>
            <li>Did not make any significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>* Goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
            <li>* Goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin too</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it very much!</li>
            <li>I will most certainly continue to use and purchase this product.</li>
            <li>sometimes work as a DJ for special events and DJed</li>
            <li>It hydrates like no other, and my makeup even looks better and holds better when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>The idea of serum and cream is good but only if its separate.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Cindy Crafords true contribution to skincare is marketing not her products</li>
            <li>I am glad she got this out there at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I ordered it at full price 3-years ago.</li>
            <li>Full of chemicals...</li>
            <li>it gives your face a natural, warm glow.</li>
            <li>they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The melon extract really nourish and enhance the skin, I love it.</li>
            <li>Really like the Creme De Serum product from Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li>I am going full disclosure here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad idea to run.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in leaving my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>the more effective an ingredient it will be listed as the first or second ingredient on the list.</li>
            <li>It also goes very quickly, absorbs fair, but doesn&#x27;t leave a silky smoothness like some other serums do.</li>
            <li>but I am lucky to be 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall with all my hair</li>
            <li>Not so quick.</li>
            <li>really nice smooth product -- too soon to see any results yet its only been 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  </li>
            <li>The meaningful beauty products are mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly....</li>
            <li>Went on very smooth and felt nice, but didnt see any changes from any other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>Love love love the cream - $60 at Ulta almost half price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>* No dramatic change in fine lines or wrinkles&lt;</li>

            <li>Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM made my skin very soft and  glowing.</li>
            <li>I have been a huge Philosophy and DDF fan for the past two years, and I will continue to love some of their products, but this CrÃ¨me de Serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product that I used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!!</li>
            <li>I was really excited at all the hype on the commercials but am pretty ticked off now.</li>
            <li>but I must have experienced an allergic reaction and it really dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li>but i think it was worth it to start with the kit</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin feels drier now that the serum has been completely absorbed than it did before I applied</li>
            <li>Skin feels drier after serum is absorbed</li>

            <li>Skin feels drier after serum is absorbed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also gotten so many complements on how clear and glowing it looks.</li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li>and i saw similar info as Pearl and more, and the ingredients are available.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>Right on to pearl and to sweetness&#x27;s comment to DG.</li>
            <li>I love the serum and will use it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>And my skin is smoother with a more even tone and my wrinkles are less prominent (I still get carded</li>
            <li>And my skin is smoother with a more even tone and my wrinkles are less prominent (I still get carded</li>
            <li>I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li>And they pic a spokes person who probably will never age very much.</li>
            <li>so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I exfoliate more as this goes to work quick at regenerating the cells, you really need to do this and moisturizer to have it work properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at a decent enough budget to do the full autoship of Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li>Good like it probably will order  just not right now thanks</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>The serum has never caused my eyes to burn or my skin to burn or feel funny.  </li>
            <li>I found more improvement after switching to essential oils from Origins.</li>
            <li>My skin is healthy , glowing and less fine lines ...</li>
            <li>so I was able to purchase the individual creme on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try the serum first...</li>
            <li>It was only a week of using Meaningful Beauty crÃ¨me when I got my first notice.</li>
            <li>I put this on first, then follow with the day cream.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The shipment took almost 3 weeks and they automatically sign you up for renewal monthly which I wasn&#x27;t aware of and didn&#x27;t know until I got a letter saying they were shot on inventory and couldn&#x27;t guarantee when they could send it out to me.  </li>
            <li>The lines and wrinkles are not so deep as they were, they are by no means gone, but they do look better.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, in my 30s, I got acne.</li>
            <li>anyway, I apologize that this review is not from a verified purchaser because I got the stuff for free and after nearly a month</li>

            <li>According to TruthinAging, \\&quot;You can mostly find [it] in ... foundation, facial moisturizer/lotion, hair dye, shampoo/conditioner, styling gel, anti-frizz treatment, sunscreen, anti-aging treatment and</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but absolute success with this product.  </li>
            <li>bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li>i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li>love it have used it for over a year now seen a big difference will keep using</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>smooth consistency -- only have used it two weeks so far -- skin is smoother -- hopefully the longer I use it, the better the results.  </li>
            <li>I noticed results in the first week</li>
            <li>My skin looked smooth and soft when using this  </li>
            <li>It was within my budget and one of the first things I had been wanting to try.</li>
            <li>(no I did not buy it the first time out the box)</li>
            <li>All they could say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast price is right, wife loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked at high end day spa and have rarely seen this type of reults in their products with triple or more price tag used religiously...</li>
            <li>They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li>Used on clean skin after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Did give to roommate who did NOT have the sensitive skin reaction like I did.  </li>
            <li>Have received positive comments.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 now and can pretty much get away with being 38.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the entire Meaningful Beauty kit at one time but really only liked the serum and the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Well, I fell in love with everything except small oiled filled balls.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I certainly intend to keep using this</li>
            <li>Honestly I was skeptical at first, I watched the infomercial and was ok &amp;#34;OK,</li>
            <li>I do like this serum, my skin looks good when I first apply it on my face, BUT it seems my skin gets a little dry quickly; the serum really does not moisturize my face well, and the look my skin has when I first put the serum on fades away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>slight redness on my face which is similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced on occasion when I used Retin-A.  </li>
            <li>i cannot believe the difference in tone, fine lines, deep pores, pockets that have improved.</li>
            <li>These people make so much money off of certain people.</li>
            <li>and this really works for her and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems.</li>
            <li>really does make your face look wonders.</li>
            <li>Rather follow real peoples reviews.</li>
            <li>really works.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li>.it works very well.  </li>
            <li>cleansing, and it keeps my skin soft and feeling fresh in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture and it leaves skin velvety.</li>
            <li>I used Oil of Olay my whole life.</li>
            <li>It really did a job.</li>
            <li>I tried the whole product line.</li>
            <li>I really think it is a lot of hype.</li>
            <li>Too soon to really see if lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I did not want the whole set</li>
            <li>does it really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>My work gives us  free samples from various companies, and  a month ago I got this.</li>
            <li>My mom, unlike me, has really oily skin, but this worked well on her.</li>
            <li>I always tell my clients if you cannot understand, pronounce any of the ingredients, then what are you really buying????.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now in my 50&#x27;s and have noticed a real difference with my skin and for some reason</li>
            <li>My face is much softer and 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It was VERY embarrassing to leave the house without some coverup, bb cream, or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been very oily since I had a hysterectomy</li>
            <li>this product really works</li>
            <li>Well, not so much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality, so I really couldn&#x27;t take off a star for that.</li>
            <li>The product makes your face feel very silky and youthful.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, its really helped keeping the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if she REALLY was a part of creating this stuff, and if she was, shame on her.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says and leaves your skin really really</li>
            <li>I really believe in this product and have been using it for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>it works really well to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Tried using the whole product line</li>
            <li>the whole kit works.  </li>
            <li>So I. Have been using the whole kit for three months now.</li>
            <li>i have use this product for over 2 years and really like it, does not cake in your face.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I have mixed feelings concerning the product&#x27;s overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thus far, this is the only product i&#x27;ve tried by Meaningful Beauty that has had any effect on my skin.    </li>
            <li>I never got to use the contents because I returned it due to a better price being located</li>
            <li>You know for once I would like to hear more from a reviewer on all the things these so called miracle creams are suppose to help other than it made my skin softer or it made my face glow, until you go through menopause, your estrogen is plumping up your skin</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that I got just a little bit of that melon from the South of France that Dr. Jean-Lois Sebagh talks about in the commercials.</li>
            <li>I am in love and will never use any other product again.</li>
            <li>Others might be interested to know that D5 is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to toxic dry cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li>Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum does leave my face with a nice, healthy glow...but that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t last long enough -- only and hour or two -- to justify the product&#x27;s $40 price tag.</li>

            <li>I found it odd that NOT ONE of the meaningful beauty products on Amazon come with an ingredient list (by this supplier or any others) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m less than a year away from being 30, and my skin looks better then</li>
            <li>I looked even older.</li>
            <li>I love the neck and chesk cream when women who have not taken care of that area, it&#x27;s totally beyong gross!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple months with once a week application and my face had developed acne.</li>
            <li>try just to be sure that I tried it for long enough.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of those ads I constantly see and be like &amp;#34;pssh</li>
            <li>They never sent my &amp;#34;after 90 days&amp;#34; supply, and then I got a whole new kit for $49.95, and the billing was completely screwed up.</li>
            <li>(The pink is more of a pale salmon color and an air bubble had mooshed part of the strands so they are not as clean as shown.)</li>
            <li>and I just learned to live with it...</li>
            <li>When I put the serum on, my skin feels new...</li>
            <li>it feels new.  </li>
            <li>I payed a price for a new product and it was used.</li>
            <li>( i must say I live in an apartment</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I can live without it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not receive a list of ingredients with my bottle of Meaningful Beauty Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum, so I do not know how accurate</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not receive a list of ingredients with my bottle of Meaningful Beauty CrÃ¨me de Serum, so I do not know how accurate these claims are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft , I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>VERY far from it.  </li>
            <li>I also highly doubt this is what&#x27;s keeping Cindy looking young, or</li>
            <li>Very soft and soothing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>The product leaves my skin very soft and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t see much difference, but this actually makes my skin look softer and smoother and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Love this product I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li>I will say that it does make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>So far I am noticing my eye lines are going away!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my skin loves this product!</li>
            <li>I called to complain and they told me first they could reduce the price on future shipments.</li>
            <li>I called Meaningful beauty now for the 3rd time and was told this was my 2nd payment of 3 installments because they haven&#x27;t received the shipment back.</li>
            <li>and i love it!!I&#x27;m 37 and started to notice small lines</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they claim and my skin looks and feels considerably younger!</li>
            <li>After using it every night for 2 weeks I noticed a pretty solid change in my skin.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY will be purchasing again Ty ;)</li>
            <li>Go to walmart or your nearest drug store &amp; you&#x27;ll see that many similar products by olay cost maybe a dollar less, if not the exact same price.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum, but it&#x27;s way too expensive full price from Cindy Crawford, so I order it here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Creme de Serum every night for less than two weeks now and, after the first few days, developed a kind of burning/dryness/</li>
            <li>, if all I wanted was soft moisturizer glowing skin, I can continue my exfoliation and my great moisturizing over the counter cream, and the miracle melon is pretty far down on the list of ingredients to be the  secret anti aging weapon in this cream,</li>
            <li>I am 53 and had extensive sun damage ,really dry and wrinkled skin with huge pores!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The laugh lines around my eyes are tauter, if slightly \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; -- which isn&#x27;t very flattering or natural-looking.</li>
            <li>I have a large age spot on my upper cheek</li>
            <li>/&gt;How can these products be quality when the company clearly has no ethics?  </li>
            <li>Makes skin soft</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow what did you do to your skin</li>
            <li>They are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Announce  ONE  natural  </li>
            <li>and  you have a natural  GOD  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it was old.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>i just wanted to stay looking young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to men and women in my family and all rave how it feels going on and keeps their skin soft and smooth-looking.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a glow and is baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have used professional skincare for years.</li>
            <li>The sheer formula is non-greasy and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>A \\&quot;pinched\\&quot;, unnatural look near the eyes</li>
            <li>A \\&quot;pinched\\&quot;, unnatural look near the eyes</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of use these two products my family couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting me as to how young my skin looked.</li>
            <li>It baffled my family (my dad has aphasia and was still able to communicate that my skin had gone to hell), and my boyfriend, who just seemed confused by his adult gf going though some very teenaged skin drama.</li>
            <li>Plus my 40 year old boyfriend looks about 34/35</li>
            <li>Plus my 40 year old boyfriend looks about 34/35</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and you can see results within just a week or two.</li>
            <li>The real question is, can cyclopentasiloxane (\\&quot;D5\\&quot; for short) cause cancer?</li>
            <li>It goes on almost like velvet and makes my skin feel so soft without any greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li>I do get compliments on how young I look.</li>
            <li>I could put my whole body in a big tub and just soak in it</li>
            <li>and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>For me, being 27 years old I didn&#x27;t purchase this product to reduce pre-existing wrinkles, though here&#x27;s hoping it can prevent some.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And believe me my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product, those are now gone after only 2 months!</li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SILKY SOFT AND DOESN&#x27;T BURN THE EYES</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 Years old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference, another product made for young skin.</li>
            <li>I was like wow</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and enriched.  </li>
            <li>As, a photographer during the 80&#x27;s when Cindy Crawford was at her hottest and as far as I&#x27;m concerned she still is.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>After about a month of using this almost everyday, i have noticed that my pores look much smaller &amp; my skin tone is a bit more even &amp; also has a bit of a glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had random people tell me how good my skin looks since using this.</li>
            <li>Good for my skin but too expensive.</li>
            <li>The search has only intensified in recent years due to an increasingly youth-obsessed, internet-based culture that&#x27;s more often Photoshopped than not.</li>
            <li>no tight skin after use.</li>
            <li>The eye lifter is such a blessing; in my family we have what I call Panda eyes and that stuff is such a blessing actually everything is a true blessing from God</li>
            <li>Serious Skin Care by Jennifer Stallone is way better products.  </li>
            <li>Nice facial cream but not a good wrinkle decreasing product as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey</li>
            <li>I have a five year old son, and when I was pregnant, another gift I received was two brown marks on each cheek about the size of a quarter a little below each eye.  </li>
            <li>I this product wasn&#x27;t in any way special or different from any other face cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Went back to previous products and fortunately my skin returned to its normal  younger looking appeal.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my normal regime and within two days it was back to normal.</li>
            <li>I bought the start up kit for $39.99 and the money back if not happy was good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The night cream I actually use it during the day also it goes on so smooth and creamy a little bit of Heaven in that jar.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s well hidden!</li>
            <li>tried some drug store face moisturizers as well as some &#x27;natural&#x27; moisturizers you can get at a coop or natural food store, but for me, I always come back to the Meaning Beauty serum.</li>
            <li>I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement in the texture.  </li>
            <li>There are two major things that the product does to my face that I am grateful for.</li>
            <li>I am in customer service for a major phone company...</li>
            <li>I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  </li>
            <li>Once you apply if on your skin it sinks right in and your face feels the same way it does after you washed it.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and young all day long.</li>
            <li>but this serum and the toner i used only on those spots and WOW is</li>
            <li>Plus she&#x27;s only 45 years old.</li>
            <li>I am 54 yrs old, earlier yrs - sun damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and will not be recommending it to family or friends in the near future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and will not be recommending it to family or friends in the near future.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and recently attended a family wedding.</li>
            <li>The serum can be worn day and night, I do use a different eye cream directly around my eyes since this product can make the eye area puffy if you put it too close under the eye and on the lid.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have problematic skin my entire life.</li>
            <li>Please do your own research on these ingredients (which are unfortunately STILL found in hundreds of beauty/health care/</li>
            <li>With that said however, i&#x27;m not seeing any difference, better or worse, in terms of diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles.     </li>
            <li>If you want to live long, do not use this.</li>
            <li>I was honestly going to get on lifebooker and get an appt to have those giant red skin spots from massive pimples laser removed before my brothers wedding because I had given up hope that they&#x27;d ever go away, but literally less than a month after using this stuff they have!!!!</li>

            <li>Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum is a brand new youth-enhancing skin treatment created by French anti-aging specialist Dr. Jean Louis Sebagh, with the endorsement of supermodel Cindy Crawford, that takes a triple approach to combating the signs of aging with three powerful anti-aging ingredients: superantioxidant melon complex, anti-aging peptides and hyaluronic</li>
            <li>You will notice that Cindy Crawford only uses young people in her ads because they don&#x27;t have facial wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and its worth the financial sacrifice.</li>
            <li>Love this, makes your skin feel soft, it is expensive, but does work well</li>
            <li>I finally had to go through that wasteland during a major cleaning task and after finding that stuff I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>So even though l was a little hesitant at first, thank goodness I tried it.</li>
            <li>wrinkles don&#x27;t seem to be true - at least they weren&#x27;t in my experience.  </li>
            <li>I bought the whole package which included eye cream, wrinkle cream for cheats and neck, creme de serum and these little capsules that apparently are infused with this melon stuff.  </li>
            <li>the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty was in there and the the past few years</li>
            <li>The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
            <li>We have created numerous miracle creams and skin treatments to help slow down and even reverse the ravages of time, but none have been able to stop it -- yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, as with any new product, but I was pleasantly surprised when after a week, my skin started looking fresh and</li>
            <li>Purists may want to stay away from the stuff here and in a thousand other products (and live in a bubble to avoid exposure via the environment).</li>
            <li>The only part that I didn&#x27;t like as much was the glowing serum as it was a little oily</li>
            <li>Probably has as much to do with vegan diet and lack of stressors as with beauty products, but I like a little extra insurance against the effects of the aging process.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and moist , however I have not seen any other benefits.</li>
            <li>I bought the eye cream as well as the wrinkle smoothing capsules &amp; haven&#x27;t seen a bit of difference, good or bad, in terms of wrinkles, crows feet, lines, etc &amp; won&#x27;t buy those again.  </li>
            <li>As a huge skin care advocate, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this serum before.</li>
            <li>I have always really liked Cindy Crawford and am really surprised she would attach her name to such a badly run company.</li>

            <li> Lightweight and smells very nice.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Cindy Crawford and your amazing team!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to wake up after using this product and you see your skin looking more youthful.</li>
            <li> This is the best of Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the best line ...</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so nice!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t depend on what others say, for your own health&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with the effects although i find i need a good moisturizer over it for the best effect.</li>
            <li> For some reason it does not work as good together</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> At 60, surprising to get compliments on my skin</li>
            <li> Her face was looking good.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a wonderful, light scent.</li>
            <li> but i think the night cream works great on its own.</li>
            <li> Go hide under a rock and mix your skincare outta your nuts and trees and see how good you look , go to wholefoods and buy your antiaging and shutup,,</li>
            <li> Since she always looks good and is picky as to what she wears, I am assuming that it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, like Petroleum jelly, and dries to a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Philosophy and DDF for my skincare.</li>
            <li> The product has a good feel and does not feel &#x27;oily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing though.</li>
            <li> I think  it is good moisturize.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on your face.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> good luck trying to get it all sorted out.</li>
            <li> So I decided to look on Amazon.com to find just the serum and found it at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, oily, fair skin for reference.</li>
            <li> I look good.</li>
            <li> It does feel good when going on.</li>
            <li> Glad I had the discount price and the glow is beautiful on the face.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and how quickly it arrived</li>
            <li> But i loved this serum the most!</li>
            <li> Very happy with it and Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is magic, great results</li>
            <li> I want to spread the joy--I am very pleased the way my skin has responded to this serum.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so happy and can&#x27;t wait to see more.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Have ordered more than once!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin top notch all day!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, savings through Amazon is amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> and I really really love it!</li>
            <li> First of all, This skin care line- products are not organic in any way!!!!  </li>
            <li> The seller was very good about getting my product to me safely and fast, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> But this is just amazing.</li>
            <li> She had used it for a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Well let me say this is an amazing product</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always had amazing skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> Creme de Serum is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> But the creme de serum, neck cream, both eye creams and wrinkle caps were amazing.</li>
            <li> but it  does feel good on skin but need more time to see if it makes a difference in smoothing and firming.</li>
            <li> Also, this product has greatly reduced my &amp;#34;parentheses&amp;#34; and for that I am most grateful -- even more than the reduction in the reddening.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you do your own research before trying this product.</li>
            <li> nice and silky-----never want to use anything else</li>
            <li> However, the smell of the product is really nice.</li>
            <li> I came home and purchased my own.</li>
            <li> but it will make your skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li> You really feel like you are giving your skin the best.  </li>
            <li> Best way to describe it is a new vinyl shower curtain, placed in the microwave and melted.</li>

            <li> Message to Meaningful</li>
            <li> Just put the melon in, maybe add some safe conditioning products and keep your customers safe from toxic yuck?</li>

            <li> I might give it one more</li>
            <li> I buy from Amazon  to avoid the Meaningful Beauty auto ship.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever, I buy it twice a year, so I don&#x27;t need to pay the $50 a month to have orders from the Meaningful Beauty site.</li>
            <li> Love love love how my skin feels after using this.  </li>
            <li> but my skin feels and looks much better, I would recommend this to everyone over 50 or under</li>
            <li> * Softens pores and adds a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Softens pores and adds a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t sure how&#x27;d I feel about this.  </li>
            <li> I have never heard of anybody getting cancer after using products from the Meaningful Beauty Line.</li>
            <li> I intend to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love thus product and what it does for your skin</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love Creme De Serum.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have used many a product in my day.</li>
            <li> I add more to this review</li>
            <li> since it was top seller in the line.</li>
            <li> Some of the top skin serums at Sephora don&#x27;t even measure up.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will purchase it again</li>
            <li> The longer I use the product the better</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> chemicals and more chemicals.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the chance to tell her that I use Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM.</li>
            <li> Both products, CrÃ¨me De Serum and Meaningful Beauty Lifting Eye Creme are satisfactory although I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on my face or eyes.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;ve tried better.</li>
            <li> The serum helps with the crows feet and my makeup stays better without all the facal oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Meaningful Beauty works well.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, but after 2 months using it, I have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I am just glad I didn&#x27;t sign up for the monthly delivery of the products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this moisterizer maks</li>
            <li> I would rate it a 5 star if it were more like $20 and not $35.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of stuff from the doctor, more creams, and more exfoliants...</li>
            <li> I love the creme de serum.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, been using it for years and my skin is sensitive, and leaves it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> They love to send out additional product AND charge your credit card over and over and</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware of ordering through the meaningful beauty web site.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the meaningful beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist even noticed my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Meaningful Beauty 0 stars if I could since 1 is even a stretch.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a guy I&#x27;ve had a chance to recognize most if not all before pictures of actors are shown with no makeup v. the after pictures of actors wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> One would think for the cost, these would be safe for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall extremely happy with this serum!</li>
            <li> I use the product and love it,it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t see results in 2 weeks, I&#x27;m on to the next latest and greatest thing.</li>
            <li> I have never had such great customer service - EVER!  </li>
            <li> Found it interesting that on the US website, ingredients are NOT listed, but when I googled CCMB ingredients, they came up on the Scandenavian website.  </li>
            <li> Seems like the authentic Cindy Crawford product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the CrÃ¨me De Serum....</li>
            <li> I love this serum</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging.  </li>
            <li> Love this .</li>
            <li> I started with a trial of Meaningful Beauty and then found out I would be paying a lot of $$$$$ per month.</li>
            <li> I love her products but do not use them all.</li>
            <li> I will order all my Meaningful Beauty this way.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more vials of this  but cancelled the order</li>
            <li> Use vasoline for better result.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> If this stuff is safe, why does everything I use that has it listed in the top four ingredients</li>
            <li> I love all of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Yes, here we go again another celebrity trying to make more money, but as she spoke</li>
            <li> ITEM IS HIGH QUALITY GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to be a great product in my arsenal to keep looking as young as I can!!</li>
            <li> This would be great for normal and oily skin.</li>
            <li> The cream makes my face soft , beautiful and radiant in the morning.</li>
            <li> Staying young and beautiful is every woman&#x27;s dream.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels so smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> , Meaningful beauty will not help fine lines or wrinkles PEROID.</li>
            <li> people, it does, and it&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum -- a product I received free from Influenster.</li>
            <li> You can get great deals on Amazon rather than buying complete kits of things you don&#x27;t use from their website.  </li>
            <li> nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> If you have a great ingredient like the melon you mention in the commercial, why ruin it with so many yuck ingredients??</li>
            <li> , it was too strong.</li>
            <li> Felt good on skin but did nothing older women need a stronger product to get any noticeable results .</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels really nice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum had brightened my face smoothed fine lines and shrunk my pores.</li>
            <li> Reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re set up with auto shipments - which is fine.  </li>
            <li> I was using this serum for 6 months and had a noticeable difference in fine lines and skin softness.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in fine lines and</li>
            <li> Its smooth and goes on nicely but the one i bought on amazon smells kinda funny.</li>
            <li> My acne and the spots that seemed to scar where volcanic pimples once stood are quickly disappearing if not completly gone!</li>
            <li> quickly disappearing if not completly gone!</li>
            <li> Better than advertised, arrived quickly, well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good product, the skin is very soft and you see the difference .</li>
            <li> My skin is so wonderful I hardly need this :).</li>
            <li> I thought since they were promoting the magic ingredient to be a melon that I would take the chance on the fact it might actually be a nice natural product.</li>
            <li> Just after a month I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My pores were huge.</li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth.</li>
            <li> Its so smooth</li>
            <li> then smooth skin in those spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> So, that is one thing that the serum is fantastic for.  </li>
            <li> At 40 that&#x27;s important ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I use it every morning after I wash my face and it feels smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> this Creme De Serum is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The pay was meh, but they tried to make up with that with a gift bag filled with stuff and</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone, fantastic skin care</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> It feels so wonderful on your skin and its not oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> -you for making the product available here</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the results for this serum because I&#x27;m using this more for maintenance and prevention of wrinkles and skin damage, but I must say, I love the feel.  </li>
            <li> so far so good....</li>
            <li> /&gt;MeaningfulBeauty.com boasts, \\&quot;Combining the power of a serum with the rich, moisturizing effects of a cr&amp;egrave;me, this super-boost is designed to help protect, increase hydration and prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I have allergies and definitely can&#x27;t use scented products so this is great!</li>
            <li> The Only thing I&#x27;ve Ever found on the market that keeps my skins healthy and blemish free!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten into this nightly ritual of coming home from work, washing my face with a steamy hot washcloth, then putting on my Creme de Serum, followed by the Meaningful Beauty Night Cream just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I cannot determine that there has been any significant change in moisture retention, firmness or improved appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> the original ad for this at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of all the Meaningful Beauty products but this one I love!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> But I fell in love with this product the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> so I opted for meaningful Beauty first.</li>
            <li> Did not make any significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> * Goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
            <li> * Goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry skin too</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it very much!</li>
            <li> I will most certainly continue to use and purchase this product.</li>
            <li> sometimes work as a DJ for special events and DJed</li>
            <li> It hydrates like no other, and my makeup even looks better and holds better when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> The idea of serum and cream is good but only if its separate.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Cindy Crafords true contribution to skincare is marketing not her products</li>
            <li> I am glad she got this out there at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I ordered it at full price 3-years ago.</li>
            <li> Full of chemicals...</li>
            <li> it gives your face a natural, warm glow.</li>
            <li> they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The melon extract really nourish and enhance the skin, I love it.</li>
            <li> Really like the Creme De Serum product from Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li> I am going full disclosure here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad idea to run.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in leaving my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> the more effective an ingredient it will be listed as the first or second ingredient on the list.</li>
            <li> It also goes very quickly, absorbs fair, but doesn&#x27;t leave a silky smoothness like some other serums do.</li>
            <li> but I am lucky to be 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall with all my hair</li>
            <li> Not so quick.</li>
            <li> really nice smooth product -- too soon to see any results yet its only been 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  </li>
            <li> The meaningful beauty products are mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> The product came quickly....</li>
            <li> Went on very smooth and felt nice, but didnt see any changes from any other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> Love love love the cream - $60 at Ulta almost half price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> * No dramatic change in fine lines or wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li> * No dramatic change in fine lines or wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM made my skin very soft and  glowing.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge Philosophy and DDF fan for the past two years, and I will continue to love some of their products, but this CrÃ¨me de Serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product that I used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited at all the hype on the commercials but am pretty ticked off now.</li>
            <li> but I must have experienced an allergic reaction and it really dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> but i think it was worth it to start with the kit</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels drier now that the serum has been completely absorbed than it did before I applied</li>
            <li> Skin feels drier after serum is absorbed</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels drier now that the serum has been completely absorbed than it did before I applied</li>
            <li> Skin feels drier after serum is absorbed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gotten so many complements on how clear and glowing it looks.</li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li> and i saw similar info as Pearl and more, and the ingredients are available.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> Right on to pearl and to sweetness&#x27;s comment to DG.</li>
            <li> I love the serum and will use it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> And my skin is smoother with a more even tone and my wrinkles are less prominent (I still get carded</li>
            <li> And my skin is smoother with a more even tone and my wrinkles are less prominent (I still get carded</li>
            <li> I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li> And they pic a spokes person who probably will never age very much.</li>
            <li> so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I exfoliate more as this goes to work quick at regenerating the cells, you really need to do this and moisturizer to have it work properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at a decent enough budget to do the full autoship of Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> Good like it probably will order  just not right now thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> The serum has never caused my eyes to burn or my skin to burn or feel funny.  </li>
            <li> I found more improvement after switching to essential oils from Origins.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthy , glowing and less fine lines ...</li>
            <li> so I was able to purchase the individual creme on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try the serum first...</li>
            <li> It was only a week of using Meaningful Beauty crÃ¨me when I got my first notice.</li>
            <li> I put this on first, then follow with the day cream.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The shipment took almost 3 weeks and they automatically sign you up for renewal monthly which I wasn&#x27;t aware of and didn&#x27;t know until I got a letter saying they were shot on inventory and couldn&#x27;t guarantee when they could send it out to me.  </li>
            <li> The lines and wrinkles are not so deep as they were, they are by no means gone, but they do look better.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, in my 30s, I got acne.</li>
            <li> anyway, I apologize that this review is not from a verified purchaser because I got the stuff for free and after nearly a month</li>

            <li> bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li> i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li> love it have used it for over a year now seen a big difference will keep using</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> smooth consistency -- only have used it two weeks so far -- skin is smoother -- hopefully the longer I use it, the better the results.  </li>
            <li> I noticed results in the first week</li>
            <li> My skin looked smooth and soft when using this  </li>
            <li> It was within my budget and one of the first things I had been wanting to try.</li>
            <li> (no I did not buy it the first time out the box)</li>
            <li> All they could say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast price is right, wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked at high end day spa and have rarely seen this type of reults in their products with triple or more price tag used religiously...</li>
            <li> They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li> Used on clean skin after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Did give to roommate who did NOT have the sensitive skin reaction like I did.  </li>
            <li> Have received positive comments.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 now and can pretty much get away with being 38.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the entire Meaningful Beauty kit at one time but really only liked the serum and the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Well, I fell in love with everything except small oiled filled balls.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I certainly intend to keep using this</li>
            <li> Honestly I was skeptical at first, I watched the infomercial and was ok &amp;#34;OK,</li>
            <li> I do like this serum, my skin looks good when I first apply it on my face, BUT it seems my skin gets a little dry quickly; the serum really does not moisturize my face well, and the look my skin has when I first put the serum on fades away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> slight redness on my face which is similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced on occasion when I used Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> i cannot believe the difference in tone, fine lines, deep pores, pockets that have improved.</li>
            <li> These people make so much money off of certain people.</li>
            <li> and this really works for her and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems.</li>
            <li> really does make your face look wonders.</li>
            <li> Rather follow real peoples reviews.</li>
            <li> really works.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li> .it works very well.  </li>
            <li> cleansing, and it keeps my skin soft and feeling fresh in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture and it leaves skin velvety.</li>
            <li> I used Oil of Olay my whole life.</li>
            <li> It really did a job.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole product line.</li>
            <li> I really think it is a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> Too soon to really see if lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I did not want the whole set</li>
            <li> does it really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> My work gives us  free samples from various companies, and  a month ago I got this.</li>
            <li> My mom, unlike me, has really oily skin, but this worked well on her.</li>
            <li> I always tell my clients if you cannot understand, pronounce any of the ingredients, then what are you really buying????.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my 50&#x27;s and have noticed a real difference with my skin and for some reason</li>
            <li> My face is much softer and 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It was VERY embarrassing to leave the house without some coverup, bb cream, or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been very oily since I had a hysterectomy</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> Well, not so much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality, so I really couldn&#x27;t take off a star for that.</li>
            <li> The product makes your face feel very silky and youthful.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, its really helped keeping the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if she REALLY was a part of creating this stuff, and if she was, shame on her.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says and leaves your skin really really</li>
            <li> I really believe in this product and have been using it for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> it works really well to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Tried using the whole product line</li>
            <li> the whole kit works.  </li>
            <li> So I. Have been using the whole kit for three months now.</li>
            <li> i have use this product for over 2 years and really like it, does not cake in your face.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I have mixed feelings concerning the product&#x27;s overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thus far, this is the only product i&#x27;ve tried by Meaningful Beauty that has had any effect on my skin.    </li>
            <li> I never got to use the contents because I returned it due to a better price being located</li>
            <li> You know for once I would like to hear more from a reviewer on all the things these so called miracle creams are suppose to help other than it made my skin softer or it made my face glow, until you go through menopause, your estrogen is plumping up your skin</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that I got just a little bit of that melon from the South of France that Dr. Jean-Lois Sebagh talks about in the commercials.</li>
            <li> I am in love and will never use any other product again.</li>
            <li> Others might be interested to know that D5 is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to toxic dry cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li> Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum does leave my face with a nice, healthy glow...but that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t last long enough -- only and hour or two -- to justify the product&#x27;s $40 price tag.</li>
            <li> CrÃ¨me de Serum does leave my face with a nice, healthy glow...but that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t last long enough -- only and hour or two -- to justify the product&#x27;s $40 price tag.</li>
            <li> I found it odd that NOT ONE of the meaningful beauty products on Amazon come with an ingredient list (by this supplier or any others) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than a year away from being 30, and my skin looks better then</li>
            <li> I looked even older.</li>
            <li> I love the neck and chesk cream when women who have not taken care of that area, it&#x27;s totally beyong gross!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple months with once a week application and my face had developed acne.</li>
            <li> try just to be sure that I tried it for long enough.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of those ads I constantly see and be like &amp;#34;pssh</li>
            <li> They never sent my &amp;#34;after 90 days&amp;#34; supply, and then I got a whole new kit for $49.95, and the billing was completely screwed up.</li>
            <li> (The pink is more of a pale salmon color and an air bubble had mooshed part of the strands so they are not as clean as shown.)</li>
            <li> and I just learned to live with it...</li>
            <li> When I put the serum on, my skin feels new...</li>
            <li> it feels new.  </li>
            <li> I payed a price for a new product and it was used.</li>
            <li> ( i must say I live in an apartment</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I can live without it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive a list of ingredients with my bottle of Meaningful Beauty Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum, so I do not know how accurate</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive a list of ingredients with my bottle of Meaningful Beauty CrÃ¨me de Serum, so I do not know how accurate these claims are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft , I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> VERY far from it.  </li>
            <li> I also highly doubt this is what&#x27;s keeping Cindy looking young, or</li>
            <li> Very soft and soothing to the skin.  </li>
            <li> The product leaves my skin very soft and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t see much difference, but this actually makes my skin look softer and smoother and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li> I will say that it does make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> So far I am noticing my eye lines are going away!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin loves this product!</li>
            <li> I called to complain and they told me first they could reduce the price on future shipments.</li>
            <li> I called Meaningful beauty now for the 3rd time and was told this was my 2nd payment of 3 installments because they haven&#x27;t received the shipment back.</li>
            <li> and i love it!!I&#x27;m 37 and started to notice small lines</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they claim and my skin looks and feels considerably younger!</li>
            <li> After using it every night for 2 weeks I noticed a pretty solid change in my skin.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY will be purchasing again Ty ;)</li>
            <li> Go to walmart or your nearest drug store &amp; you&#x27;ll see that many similar products by olay cost maybe a dollar less, if not the exact same price.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum, but it&#x27;s way too expensive full price from Cindy Crawford, so I order it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Creme de Serum every night for less than two weeks now and, after the first few days, developed a kind of burning/dryness/</li>
            <li> , if all I wanted was soft moisturizer glowing skin, I can continue my exfoliation and my great moisturizing over the counter cream, and the miracle melon is pretty far down on the list of ingredients to be the  secret anti aging weapon in this cream,</li>
            <li> I am 53 and had extensive sun damage ,really dry and wrinkled skin with huge pores!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The laugh lines around my eyes are tauter, if slightly \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; -- which isn&#x27;t very flattering or natural-looking.</li>
            <li> I have a large age spot on my upper cheek</li>
            <li> /&gt;How can these products be quality when the company clearly has no ethics?  </li>
            <li> Makes skin soft</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> wow what did you do to your skin</li>
            <li> They are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Announce  ONE  natural  </li>
            <li> and  you have a natural  GOD  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it was old.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> i just wanted to stay looking young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to men and women in my family and all rave how it feels going on and keeps their skin soft and smooth-looking.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a glow and is baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have used professional skincare for years.</li>
            <li> The sheer formula is non-greasy and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;pinched\\&quot;, unnatural look near the eyes</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;pinched\\&quot;, unnatural look near the eyes</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of use these two products my family couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting me as to how young my skin looked.</li>
            <li> It baffled my family (my dad has aphasia and was still able to communicate that my skin had gone to hell), and my boyfriend, who just seemed confused by his adult gf going though some very teenaged skin drama.</li>
            <li> Plus my 40 year old boyfriend looks about 34/35</li>
            <li> Plus my 40 year old boyfriend looks about 34/35</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and you can see results within just a week or two.</li>
            <li> The real question is, can cyclopentasiloxane (\\&quot;D5\\&quot; for short) cause cancer?</li>
            <li> It goes on almost like velvet and makes my skin feel so soft without any greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li> I do get compliments on how young I look.</li>
            <li> I could put my whole body in a big tub and just soak in it</li>
            <li> and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> For me, being 27 years old I didn&#x27;t purchase this product to reduce pre-existing wrinkles, though here&#x27;s hoping it can prevent some.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And believe me my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, those are now gone after only 2 months!</li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SILKY SOFT AND DOESN&#x27;T BURN THE EYES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 Years old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference, another product made for young skin.</li>
            <li> I was like wow</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and enriched.  </li>
            <li> As, a photographer during the 80&#x27;s when Cindy Crawford was at her hottest and as far as I&#x27;m concerned she still is.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this almost everyday, i have noticed that my pores look much smaller &amp; my skin tone is a bit more even &amp; also has a bit of a glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had random people tell me how good my skin looks since using this.</li>
            <li> Good for my skin but too expensive.</li>
            <li> The search has only intensified in recent years due to an increasingly youth-obsessed, internet-based culture that&#x27;s more often Photoshopped than not.</li>
            <li> no tight skin after use.</li>
            <li> The eye lifter is such a blessing; in my family we have what I call Panda eyes and that stuff is such a blessing actually everything is a true blessing from God</li>
            <li> Serious Skin Care by Jennifer Stallone is way better products.  </li>
            <li> Nice facial cream but not a good wrinkle decreasing product as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey</li>
            <li> I have a five year old son, and when I was pregnant, another gift I received was two brown marks on each cheek about the size of a quarter a little below each eye.  </li>
            <li> I this product wasn&#x27;t in any way special or different from any other face cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Went back to previous products and fortunately my skin returned to its normal  younger looking appeal.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my normal regime and within two days it was back to normal.</li>
            <li> I bought the start up kit for $39.99 and the money back if not happy was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The night cream I actually use it during the day also it goes on so smooth and creamy a little bit of Heaven in that jar.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s well hidden!</li>
            <li> tried some drug store face moisturizers as well as some &#x27;natural&#x27; moisturizers you can get at a coop or natural food store, but for me, I always come back to the Meaning Beauty serum.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement in the texture.  </li>
            <li> There are two major things that the product does to my face that I am grateful for.</li>
            <li> I am in customer service for a major phone company...</li>
            <li> I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  </li>
            <li> Once you apply if on your skin it sinks right in and your face feels the same way it does after you washed it.</li>
            <li> My face is soft and young all day long.</li>
            <li> but this serum and the toner i used only on those spots and WOW is</li>
            <li> Plus she&#x27;s only 45 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 54 yrs old, earlier yrs - sun damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and will not be recommending it to family or friends in the near future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and will not be recommending it to family or friends in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and recently attended a family wedding.</li>
            <li> The serum can be worn day and night, I do use a different eye cream directly around my eyes since this product can make the eye area puffy if you put it too close under the eye and on the lid.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have problematic skin my entire life.</li>
            <li> Please do your own research on these ingredients (which are unfortunately STILL found in hundreds of beauty/health care/</li>
            <li> With that said however, i&#x27;m not seeing any difference, better or worse, in terms of diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles.     </li>
            <li> If you want to live long, do not use this.</li>
            <li> I was honestly going to get on lifebooker and get an appt to have those giant red skin spots from massive pimples laser removed before my brothers wedding because I had given up hope that they&#x27;d ever go away, but literally less than a month after using this stuff they have!!!!</li>

            <li> Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum is a brand new youth-enhancing skin treatment created by French anti-aging specialist Dr. Jean Louis Sebagh, with the endorsement of supermodel Cindy Crawford, that takes a triple approach to combating the signs of aging with three powerful anti-aging ingredients: superantioxidant melon complex, anti-aging peptides and hyaluronic</li>
            <li> You will notice that Cindy Crawford only uses young people in her ads because they don&#x27;t have facial wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and its worth the financial sacrifice.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes your skin feel soft, it is expensive, but does work well</li>
            <li> I finally had to go through that wasteland during a major cleaning task and after finding that stuff I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> So even though l was a little hesitant at first, thank goodness I tried it.</li>
            <li> wrinkles don&#x27;t seem to be true - at least they weren&#x27;t in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole package which included eye cream, wrinkle cream for cheats and neck, creme de serum and these little capsules that apparently are infused with this melon stuff.  </li>
            <li> the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty was in there and the the past few years</li>
            <li> The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
            <li> We have created numerous miracle creams and skin treatments to help slow down and even reverse the ravages of time, but none have been able to stop it -- yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as with any new product, but I was pleasantly surprised when after a week, my skin started looking fresh and</li>
            <li> Purists may want to stay away from the stuff here and in a thousand other products (and live in a bubble to avoid exposure via the environment).</li>
            <li> The only part that I didn&#x27;t like as much was the glowing serum as it was a little oily</li>
            <li> Probably has as much to do with vegan diet and lack of stressors as with beauty products, but I like a little extra insurance against the effects of the aging process.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and moist , however I have not seen any other benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought the eye cream as well as the wrinkle smoothing capsules &amp; haven&#x27;t seen a bit of difference, good or bad, in terms of wrinkles, crows feet, lines, etc &amp; won&#x27;t buy those again.  </li>
            <li> As a huge skin care advocate, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this serum before.</li>
            <li> I have always really liked Cindy Crawford and am really surprised she would attach her name to such a badly run company.</li>
            <li> I am also disappointed that two of my favorite actresses Debra messing and valerie Bertinelli would say positive things.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to notice its &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; power, but it definitely causes my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to say if it has made any improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in the tone or texture of my skin, nor do I see any significant wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> The product REALLY worked and I have hardly any spots left after using for 2 months.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that positive reviews are written.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin, and I constantly struggle to find a moisturizer that works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been told I look younger than my age despite having dry skin.</li>
            <li> It might work differently on somebody with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The next morning it felt a bit dry.</li>
            <li> My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For the morbidly curious like me, here is a list of all 44 ingredients--45 if you count yellow and reddish-brown iron oxide pigments as two different things:&lt;br /&gt;Water, cyclopentasiloxane, glycerin, neopentyl glycol diheptanoate, pentylene glycol, castor isostearate succinate, butylene glycol, polymethylsilsesquioxane, C30-45 alkyl cetearyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer, cucumis melo (melon) fruit extract, elaesis guineensis (palm) oil, sodium hyaluronate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, soluble collagen, maltooligosyl glucoside, decarboxy carnosine HCl, hexapeptide-9, tripeptide-3, saccharomyces/zinc ferment, cholesterol, tocotrienols, tocopherol, tocopheryl acetate, lecithin, caprylyl glycol, hydrogenated vegetable oil, dimethicone, ethylhexylglycerin, silica dimethyl silylate, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, ethylhexyl hydroxystearate, hydroxypropyl guar, glyceryl acrylate/acrylic acid copolymer, polysilicone-11, carbomer, triethanolamine, hexylene glycol, denatured alcohol, disodium EDTA, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, iron oxides (ci77491, ci77492), and titanium dioxide (ci77891).</li>
            <li> So i sent it back, but when I stopped it and went back to my other creamâ€¦.</li>
            <li> helps skin stay young looking and gives a little glow to your face</li>
            <li> Love the product but the company stinks.</li>
            <li> About 1.5 years ago I got talked into buying some expensive exfoliating face scrub infused with diamonds from some smooth talking snake of a sales woman of a skin care boutique in nyc&#x27;s soho neighborhood where I work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product itself is a wonderfully smooth, if expensive, indulgence.</li>
            <li> This has so many chemicals listed I would be afraid that my skin would fall off.</li>
            <li> It will cause them to burn all day long.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, so it was NOT a fit for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this on my shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t I used the other stuff occasionally !</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY, TOO EXPENSIVE !</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s likely using a much better version of it without all the bad stuff in it-</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The picture fascinated me; I was curious to see those pink and white spirals suspended in solution.  </li>
            <li> First, I need to say I&#x27;m not rating the supplier poorly.  </li>
            <li> love it but very expensive</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from amazon since the price tag at places like Ulta is kind of crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for the past ten years, and I lived in Europe and tried different stuff from around the world.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days however and do not know what  long term use will do yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously saving so much money in other stuff that now I can drop the $$$ without batting an eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously saving so much money in other stuff that now I can drop the $$$ without batting an eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gets very dry).</li>
            <li> I feel very dry skin and use it in the morning, it is non greasy and seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> CCMB products are full of SLS and parabens, as well as other questionable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> so its a little different.</li>
            <li> One even went as far as to say they got chicken pox and another&#x27;s chin drooped a whole two inches.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was curious.</li>
            <li> I can purchase which product I want and not a whole kit at a monthly fee.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> Turns out to be cyclopentasiloxane--a lightweight, silky silicone compound that is widely used as an emollient and conditioner in skin and hair products.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price I expected perfection.</li>
            <li> The other stuff is just fluff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe because it&#x27;s like no other feel I ever had with any other cremes/lotions.  </li>
            <li> 50 years old, lifelong hard core smoker and heavy drinker, mom has tried every gimmick on tv to help her skin.</li>
            <li> I used the other stuff too, but just here and there.  </li>
            <li> Got it sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I am a guy but not a pretty boy.</li>
            <li> So I did some digging to find out what other users thought about it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sat in my product wasteland littered with other freebies.</li>
            <li> Saw the adds for this and didn&#x27;t want to go the endless recurring shipment route so found this on amazon and ordered.</li>
            <li> Now, the other products in this line, I could do without because I didn&#x27;t see any results...</li>
            <li> Even cleared up a break out my face, caused by other products, within a week.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful dealing with this company.  </li>
            <li> Crawford had had Botox injections since her late twenties plus other plastic surgery, especially recently .</li>
            <li> Its really different from other products you commonly find in stores.</li>
            <li> , the other is half the size.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s so hard to judge a product based on the reviews as my review is going to be completely opposite of what others are saying.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money did not wirk at all</li>
            <li> I still have lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li> And it will not fade dark spots or age spots</li>
            <li> Why does she not use people in their mid 60&#x27;s or at least tell people that her products will not work for them.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> I would NOT buy this product - not worth the price tag</li>
            <li> Ill try it&amp;#34; After a month I really didn&#x27;t notice it,</li>
            <li> it keeps down the wrinkles and makes you glow.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find this product makes my skin oily and feels weighed down.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> it leaves a filmy, chalky residue and it doesn&#x27;t seem to firm as well as other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li> and i bought a few other products in the line but is truly this serum that has people saying</li>
            <li> And I use less makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and other products directly through the company and now they&#x27;ve made it impossible to cancel future orders.  </li>
            <li> Buy this and don&#x27;t mess with the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> To u folks that are always yelling about parabens and cancer causing just going out the house breathing the air can mess you up .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just broken down into smaller monthly payments.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Now the little capsules I don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> Its thin enough to use before putting on makeup or it works well as a nigh lotion too.</li>
            <li> Having used it for a few weeks I do see a softer smoother look to my skin.  </li>
            <li> There is another thing that I noticed; my pimples  dried up faster while I was using the product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had acne or terribly uneven skin tone or even wrinkles</li>
            <li> After a few weeks noticed lines began to return and was looking sparkle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted m th money.</li>
            <li> I began to become very frustrated till I started using meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li> But, with my rosacea I can only use about two other products without my skin feeling uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> All these other posts about the negative stuff I believe are by competitors.</li>
            <li> so I am anxious to see the results with a  little longer use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly gone through half the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly gone through half the bottle</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that some of the small lines around my eyes have gone away.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it will do anything for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum to my face and neck for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it and didn&#x27;t notice any difference from a $20 product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> When you put it on, your skin does feel softer, but not sure if it decreases the visibility of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Still, fo this small tube, I beleive it is overpriced</li>
            <li> I had a small issue with this product</li>
            <li> This is sad that CC would endorse this product when these ingredients have long been linked to breast cancer and other serious health issues.  </li>
            <li> meaningful beauty has to be one of the worst products I have ever tried, not sure what was worse, the acne or that it looked like I smeared vaseline all over my face.</li>
            <li> Now before I started using this product my skin was dull and I had bags and noticeable wrinkles in my face</li>
            <li> She wishes to have it again but is afraid to get the same used bottle if she buys it again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I look like I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They play at least 20 times every day.</li>
            <li> According to the FDA,  the manufacturers of the product should at least send information about where the ingredients can be found if they are not listed on the samples.</li>
            <li> Now it is too late to return.  </li>
            <li> I hope Cindy Crawford doesn&#x27;t realize how rude &amp; uncaring</li>
            <li> The product is silky smooth, but has a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using the serum, I noticed a negative difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Please, try it if your skin rejects return it, at least you can say \\&quot;I Tried\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like ones that are too thick or greasy, and by the end of winter my skin has taken a beating.</li>
            <li> Minor disappointment here.</li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I also saw bad reviews from people who obviously didn&#x27;t want to pay their bill.</li>
            <li> this random fashion week event a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I placed my order &amp; was told from the beginning the cost of $39.00 I tried the product not happy</li>
            <li> My skin was noticeably worse.</li>
            <li> They are not responsible for idiots that believe when someone says your account is on hold</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the past year I&#x27;ve been dealing with this bad skin and trying to figure out what to do about this acne.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using this product on my face.</li>
            <li> expensive moisturizer</li>
            <li> How this could have worked so well for others and \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; for me is questionable?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be sorry you ever placed an order.</li>
            <li> This product should be called meaningless</li>
            <li> The refund was tedious...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an unfair presentation.</li>
            <li> but I had these weird spots under my eyes that were wrinkled and sagging...</li>
            <li> I got scammed worse!</li>
            <li> when I called today they said sorry you are out of luck.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out really bad!</li>
            <li> Also, I am sick and tired of her commercials.  </li>
            <li> Anyone buying this product is crazy.</li>
            <li> And I am no spring chicken.</li>
            <li> My schedule was hectic and I forgot about this disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> &quot; - how very disappointing and outdated!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to locate a product that would help someone in my situation.</li>
            <li> My mother has always had bad skin.</li>
            <li> I had a bad skin reaction and I started reading the ingredients</li>
            <li> And the prices aren&#x27;t to bad ...</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re not that bad, but</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re not that bad, but</li>
            <li> incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, it smells bad and the claims of fewer lines/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really shocked that Cindy Crawford is even a part of this product.</li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that Cindy Crawford puts her name on this.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely disappointed to find fillers in this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet and I wish I would have started using them 20 years ago</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this because after having my daughter I had terrible hormone blotches on my face (at least to me they were horrible).</li>
            <li> I hate these celebrity rip offs.</li>
            <li> ie:melon  then fill up  the rest  with  TOXIC  crap.  </li>
            <li> ingredients  of crap  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m very disappointed in is this product and the ingredients in this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Awful stuff, awful ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you investigate these  ingredients  that  these products carry, you would be Appalled!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still using. Makes skin soft</li>
            <li> It does not work. Save your money and buy rentinol.</li>
            <li> The idea of serum and cream is good but only if its separate.  For some reason it does not work as good together it leaves a filmy, chalky residue and it doesn&#x27;t seem to firm as well as other over the counter products.  Serious Skin Care by Jennifer Stallone is way better products.  I love Cindy but not her products. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Leaves face smooth. I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I really like it! It makes my face feel very smooth and I have noticed that some of the small lines around my eyes have gone away. I&#x27;ve not had any side effects. Its so smooth I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Have used for a couple weeks, haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product that I used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out! It&#x27;s wonderful to wake up after using this product and you see your skin looking more youthful.</li>
            <li> this product is Cindy Crawford&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for Christmas.  She has sensitive skin and this really works for her and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems.</li>
            <li> The cream makes my face soft , beautiful and radiant in the morning. No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> At 60, surprising to get compliments on my skin</li>
            <li> Great product and works!</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin looked brighter and smoother. I felt I looked younger. Great product!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li> really does make your face look wonders. it keeps down the wrinkles and makes you glow. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product made my face feel greasy and gave me a rash. I was hesitant to buy of the web sight because I  have read its the scam where they bill you monthly. I didn&#x27;t even return I just threw the rest away. Just glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with canceling a monthly subscription. I hate these celebrity rip offs. Rather follow real peoples reviews.</li>
            <li> Advertising is a gimmick when it comes to face care. Cindy is what sells this and it does not work. Who knows what she has had done.</li>
            <li> I am not big on writing reviews but when a product works for me i have to say so. I am 53 and had extensive sun damage ,really dry and wrinkled skin with huge pores!&lt;br /&gt; I bought it off the meaningful beauty site,i used the cleanser and this serum more then anything and after about three weeks folks started asking me if i had make up on,lol i didn&#x27;t I used the other stuff occasionally ! But i loved this serum the most! I had some deep bumps that seemed to never go away but this serum and the toner i used only on those spots and WOW is al i can say.&lt;br /&gt;The serum had brightened my face smoothed fine lines and shrunk my pores. I did break out in those bump areas but it was a couple days then smooth skin in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;  I did start with the kit and i bought a few other products in the line but is truly this serum that has people saying wow what did you do to your skin it looks so great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will from now on buy from amazon but i think it was worth it to start with the kit itself.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product was as described and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> My mother has always had bad skin. I havent seen.her for a while and she stop over unannounced and I ask her what she is wearing because she skin unbelievably healthy, honestly.thought shed discovered airbrush makeup. 50 years old, lifelong hard core smoker and heavy drinker, mom has tried every gimmick on tv to help her skin. She says shes been using this for last 6 months i cannot believe the difference in tone, fine lines, deep pores, pockets that have improved. I&#x27;ve worked at high end day spa and have rarely seen this type of reults in their products with triple or more price tag used religiously... I must try this myself!!!</li>
            <li> Cindy Crafords true contribution to skincare is marketing not her products</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money did not wirk at all</li>
            <li> Glad I had the discount price and the glow is beautiful on the face.  Helps around eyes at my age of 55.  Have received positive comments.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item.  She swears by it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I was using it 2x a day instead of once a day.</li>
            <li> Luv my crÃ¨me de serum.  really works.  You must try.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft , I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great....just what you would expect.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60 and have been using this product daily for two months. My skin is very soft and moist , however I have not seen any other benefits. I still have lines and dark spots. I probably will try another product next. The search continues.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for two months.  I bought the introductory setup from the website and it had all sorts of extras, a scrub, eye cream, etc.  But, the serum was the greatest thing I used.  I used the other stuff too, but just here and there.  The other stuff is just fluff.  I have rosacea and my face gets red patches here and there and I just learned to live with it...ugh.  I have a five year old son, and when I was pregnant, another gift I received was two brown marks on each cheek about the size of a quarter a little below each eye.  I have used the serum at night for two months and about a week ago I noticed the quarter sized brown spots were gone....I still get happy when I think about it.  They are completely gone.  The only thing I can contribute it to is the serum.  I was doing nothing extra.  So, that is one thing that the serum is fantastic for.  But, with my rosacea I can only use about two other products without my skin feeling uncomfortable...but the serum works better than those two...sometimes with one of them if I get too close to my eyes it burns, etc.  The serum has never caused my eyes to burn or my skin to burn or feel funny.  When I put the serum on, my skin feels new...that is the only way to explain it...it feels new.  I love the serum and will use it as long as it is available.  One bottle of 1 ounce has lasted me a month.  I use two pumps per night...I love this stuff.  I hope it is making me look younger, have not had any results about that yet.  I am 41.  I just love how it makes my skin feel and does not have any tingling that burns my rosacea skin or makes my eyes burn.  This stuff is so great and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.  My mother has started using it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work. Tried it until bottle was finished and didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Another  one of those save your  money  people!!!&lt;br /&gt;Chemistry  lab in a  bottle  and a toxic  one  at  that. That is  their  marketing  scheme . Announce  ONE  natural  ingredient ie:melon  then fill up  the rest  with  TOXIC  crap.  49  ingredients  of crap  to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;All you need is some  yogurt, honey  and  avocado  smashed  up and distributed on your  face and decolette. .Add  a tbsp. of milk and  you have a natural  GOD  given  creme  de Serum  for  your  skin.It  will  brighten soften  and erase  your  wrinkles  unlike  any creme  out  there  guaranteed&amp;#62;God  Speed&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! The Only thing I&#x27;ve Ever found on the market that keeps my skins healthy and blemish free!! At 40 that&#x27;s important ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out really bad!</li>
            <li> Good product, the skin is very soft and you see the difference .</li>
            <li> If there was Cindy and the people with their miracle melon age reversing cream would be on the show WITHOUT make up, not covered in make up and with a TV camera using a &amp;#34;soft touch&amp;#34; lens. How are they showing their &amp;#34;childlike&amp;#34; skin with pounds of makeup on?! C&#x27;mon people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do women fall for this stuff. These people make so much money off of certain people.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement in the texture.  My skin did feel softer.  I found more improvement after switching to essential oils from Origins.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product. Her face was looking good. I gave it 3 stars because it was old. I payed a price for a new product and it was used. Since then she doesn&#x27;t want to buy it anymore. She wishes to have it again but is afraid to get the same used bottle if she buys it again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> Used this for a month and saw not difference and my skin started to redden</li>
            <li> I could see a big difference in my skin and I didn&#x27;t think I would be sold on this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is magic, great results and I won&#x27;t be using anything else.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, i will use this again. The seller was very good about getting my product to me safely and fast, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it before I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love this product</li>
            <li> Nice facial cream but not a good wrinkle decreasing product as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but arrives timely</li>
            <li> This is one of the best items I&#x27;ve purchased. . .it works very well.  I use it at night. . .after cleansing, and it keeps my skin soft and feeling fresh in the morning.  I would recommend it to anyone. . .</li>
            <li> Great!!! Got it sooner than expected! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Silky i mix it with my aveno daily sun cream.</li>
            <li> First, I need to say I&#x27;m not rating the supplier poorly.  This shipped in great time and I&#x27;m very happy with the ordering/shipment process.  What I&#x27;m very disappointed in is this product and the ingredients in this stuff.  I found it odd that NOT ONE of the meaningful beauty products on Amazon come with an ingredient list (by this supplier or any others) and NO WHERE on the meaningful beauty website do they dare share the list.  Now I&#x27;m seeing why.  There are 49 ingredients in this specific product, the second of which (after water) is listed on skin deep&#x27;s website ([...]) as cancer causing.  I see many more ingredients which are too.  I was really excited at all the hype on the commercials but am pretty ticked off now. I thought since they were promoting the magic ingredient to be a melon that I would take the chance on the fact it might actually be a nice natural product. VERY far from it.  This is garbage, tossing it.  I also highly doubt this is what&#x27;s keeping Cindy looking young, or she&#x27;s likely using a much better version of it without all the bad stuff in it- or maybe she&#x27;s drinking the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; melon juice they talk about.  Message to Meaningful Beauty- If you have a great ingredient like the melon you mention in the commercial, why ruin it with so many yuck ingredients?? Just put the melon in, maybe add some safe conditioning products and keep your customers safe from toxic yuck? Sigh...</li>
            <li> Received this product in a timely manner.  And since I have used this for many years can confirm this is an authentic product from Meaningful Beauty line.</li>
            <li> Seemed like as soon as I hit place order it was at my door. Love the product works amazingly well. Will be a return customer. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I never got to use the contents because I returned it due to a better price being located but I know this to be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my face and it really does exactly what it claims, my skin feels and looks amazing :)</li>
            <li> You know for once I would like to hear more from a reviewer on all the things these so called miracle creams are suppose to help other than it made my skin softer or it made my face glow, until you go through menopause, your estrogen is plumping up your skin, Meaningful beauty will not help fine lines or wrinkles PEROID. And it will not fade dark spots or age spots, if all I wanted was soft moisturizer glowing skin, I can continue my exfoliation and my great moisturizing over the counter cream, and the miracle melon is pretty far down on the list of ingredients to be the  secret anti aging weapon in this cream, the more effective an ingredient it will be listed as the first or second ingredient on the list. Do not be scammed by this products hype.</li>
            <li> this product is my favorite I use it every morning after I wash my face and it feels smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the results for this serum because I&#x27;m using this more for maintenance and prevention of wrinkles and skin damage, but I must say, I love the feel.  It&#x27;s hard to describe because it&#x27;s like no other feel I ever had with any other cremes/lotions.  Liquid softness is the best description I can think of!</li>
            <li> Anyone buying this product is crazy. You cannot expect to have skin like Cindy Crawford!! It&#x27;s in her genes. Plus she&#x27;s only 45 years old. I didn&#x27;t even show any signs of aging until 45. I&#x27;m 62 now. Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> It works great I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for it to make the wrinkles on my forehead finer/smoother. I have used the product for about a month and see no difference in the appearance of the wrinkles. I will say that it does make my skin so soft! Its thin enough to use before putting on makeup or it works well as a nigh lotion too. Do not get it in your eyes! It will cause them to burn all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing in the whole Meaningful Beauty set and it is cheaper than buying from the source. The serum works great! Buy this and don&#x27;t mess with the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> It is light but effective.... no tight skin after use. I really like the texture and it leaves skin velvety.</li>
            <li> Pricy but it  does feel good on skin but need more time to see if it makes a difference in smoothing and firming.</li>
            <li> i would recommend anyone to buy this product, Because it work, it is not a diet product it just control you hunger and portion that you eat. It is delicious i might add.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for what it says it does.. Just another face cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li> Crawford had had Botox injections since her late twenties plus other plastic surgery, especially recently . Despite her tv ads, she does not look like she hasn&#x27;t changed.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the product if you want, but don&#x27;t believe the tv ads.</li>
            <li> ITEM IS HIGH QUALITY GREAT STUFF. THX LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Works as it says it does.</li>
            <li> Just started using it.  Love the feel of my skin when I put it on.  Not sure yet if it will do anything for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that positive reviews are written. I am also disappointed that two of my favorite actresses Debra messing and valerie Bertinelli would say positive things. This product DOES NOT work.  I saw zero changes in my skin. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used Oil of Olay my whole life. I am a guy but not a pretty boy. i just wanted to stay looking young. Now I wasn&#x27;t given the best looks to be a model but I am lucky to be 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall with all my hair and I look like I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I am 44. Yes a lot has to do with genetics but I have always conditioned my skin and neck. I just got the product if felt like velvet as I concentrated on my eyes. The only place i have wrinkles. I think this is going to be a great product in my arsenal to keep looking as young as I can!! All these other posts about the negative stuff I believe are by competitors. This is Cindy Crawford putting her name on something. That is a big deal. I am glad she got this out there at a reasonable price. So far I am noticing my eye lines are going away!</li>
            <li> This is the best of Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty.  I absolutely love the way it makes my face and neck feel. Wish it was a little cheaper I  would buy it more often.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s Creme de Serum.  I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to men and women in my family and all rave how it feels going on and keeps their skin soft and smooth-looking.  In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten into this nightly ritual of coming home from work, washing my face with a steamy hot washcloth, then putting on my Creme de Serum, followed by the Meaningful Beauty Night Cream just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product over and over again.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was curious. It really did a job. I have some reddening on my left cheek and after using this product for about 3 weeks, I notice a lessening of the redness. Also, this product has greatly reduced my &amp;#34;parentheses&amp;#34; and for that I am most grateful -- even more than the reduction in the reddening. I will most certainly continue to use and purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Awful stuff, awful ingredients. If you want to live long, do not use this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin loves this product! It is not greasy and the texture is perfect. Also, it has a wonderful, light scent. I have not been using it long enough to say if it has made any improvements in my skin but I can honestly say it has replaced my Clinique moisturizer permanently!!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I apply the serum. However I have not seen any decrease in lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use the night cream and love it and i bought the serum to go with it, but i think the night cream works great on its own.</li>
            <li> I love this. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cutomer service is superb&lt;br /&gt;Ty!</li>
            <li> I saw great results within one week. My skin has a glow and is baby soft. My eyes look more youthful. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments and have been told that I look younger than my age.</li>
            <li> I love this . very pleased!</li>
            <li> I tried the whole product line. I really think it is a lot of hype. I have used professional skincare for years. If someone has never used professional skin care I can see why they may be impressed by this product. I had a bad skin reaction and I started reading the ingredients and I was extremely disappointed to find fillers in this product. I am going to consult a skin care specialist and have them read the ingredients and get their take on it. I will update my review with my findings.</li>
            <li> To u folks that are always yelling about parabens and cancer causing just going out the house breathing the air can mess you up . Go hide under a rock and mix your skincare outta your nuts and trees and see how good you look , go to wholefoods and buy your antiaging and shutup,,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my favorite out of her skin care line ... I use all her products and I feel great ... My skin is healthy , glowing and less fine lines ... I have tried many products but this is the best line ... And the prices aren&#x27;t to bad ...</li>
            <li> Better deal than their website ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> Great product, not greasy at all.  Great for combining usage with capsules, excellent combination. Worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> feels good and goes on smoothly.  I will definitely reorder.  Too soon to really see if lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li> Received as described. Shipped fast. My wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing a difference. But I am still holding out hope. I might give it one more try just to be sure that I tried it for long enough.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I like that I can purchase which product I want and not a whole kit at a monthly fee.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and it feels wonderful.  I have never stuck to a regular regime,, but now I will</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and it is perfect for night time skin care.  I buy from Amazon  to avoid the Meaningful Beauty auto ship.  This stuff lasts forever, I buy it twice a year, so I don&#x27;t need to pay the $50 a month to have orders from the Meaningful Beauty site.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product promptly.  Having used it for a few weeks I do see a softer smoother look to my skin.  I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Love love love the cream - $60 at Ulta almost half price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but I see no results with this product. I been using it for a while. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love love love how my skin feels after using this.  I had been a Kinerase user and after being sucked in to an infomercial decided to give this a try.  Very soft and soothing to the skin.  I use it day and night... Have ordered more than once!</li>
            <li> Good product! Makes your face glow like it says it does!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week but my skin feels and looks much better, I would recommend this to everyone over 50 or under</li>
            <li> I got sucked in again to these products. I ordered it at full price 3-years ago. Never saw an inkling of an improvement.  They always use people in their 30s and 40s to advertise these facial products. Well, I am now 63 and actually thought that maybe I could get some results. Nope. Nothing.  You will notice that Cindy Crawford only uses young people in her ads because they don&#x27;t have facial wrinkles yet. Why does she not use people in their mid 60&#x27;s or at least tell people that her products will not work for them. Also, I am sick and tired of her commercials.  They play at least 20 times every day. Cindy is now 48 years-old but the commercial still says she is 44.</li>
            <li> When I first bought the original offer products, this one worked the best for me.  I did not want the whole set so I was able to purchase the individual creme on Amazon.  Very happy with it and Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a requested Christmas gift for a nurse friend so I don&#x27;t know how well it works.  Since she always looks good and is picky as to what she wears, I am assuming that it is a good product.  She was quite happy with it as a gift!!</li>
            <li> Used product 6x.  Felt great when applied, however I had a lot of redness from it.  I do have sensitive skin, so it was NOT a fit for me.  I am 54 yrs old, earlier yrs - sun damage. I tried for one week, but no difference in my skins reaction.  Used on clean skin after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Did give to roommate who did NOT have the sensitive skin reaction like I did.  She uses it 2x a week no irritations for her, she&#x27;s going to try it for 30 days.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. I had always been complimented on my skin until I tried these products.  I would never use again. Went back to previous products and fortunately my skin returned to its normal  younger looking appeal.</li>
            <li> Have you ever heard of the Fountain of Youth? For thousands of years mankind has searched the world over for a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for aging. The search has only intensified in recent years due to an increasingly youth-obsessed, internet-based culture that&#x27;s more often Photoshopped than not. We have created numerous miracle creams and skin treatments to help slow down and even reverse the ravages of time, but none have been able to stop it -- yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum -- a product I received free from Influenster. Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum is a brand new youth-enhancing skin treatment created by French anti-aging specialist Dr. Jean Louis Sebagh, with the endorsement of supermodel Cindy Crawford, that takes a triple approach to combating the signs of aging with three powerful anti-aging ingredients: superantioxidant melon complex, anti-aging peptides and hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MeaningfulBeauty.com boasts, \\&quot;Combining the power of a serum with the rich, moisturizing effects of a cr&amp;egrave;me, this super-boost is designed to help protect, increase hydration and prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way. All you need is dime-sized a dollop on the tip of your finger to start with. The sheer formula is non-greasy and very lightweight. It goes on smooth, like Petroleum jelly, and dries to a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does it really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum to my face and neck for the past two weeks and I can honestly say that I have mixed feelings concerning the product&#x27;s overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in the tone or texture of my skin, nor do I see any significant wrinkle reduction. The laugh lines around my eyes are tauter, if slightly \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; -- which isn&#x27;t very flattering or natural-looking. However, my pores are smaller and that&#x27;s always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum&#x27;s hydrating qualities? Meh. Not so much. Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum does leave my face with a nice, healthy glow...but that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t last long enough -- only and hour or two -- to justify the product&#x27;s $40 price tag. In fact, my skin feels drier now that the serum has been completely absorbed than it did before I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the final rundown...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Sheer, lightweight formula&lt;br /&gt;* Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;* Goes on smooth and dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;* Softens pores and adds a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* A \\&quot;pinched\\&quot;, unnatural look near the eyes&lt;br /&gt;* No dramatic change in fine lines or wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;* Moisturizing effects wear off after 1-2 hours&lt;br /&gt;* Skin feels drier after serum is absorbed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WARNING: There is a debate on Amazon.com as to weather this product contains \\&quot;cancer causing\\&quot; compounds (i.e. parabens and fragrances) in it or not. Unfortunately, I did not receive a list of ingredients with my bottle of Meaningful Beauty Cr&amp;egrave;me de Serum, so I do not know how accurate these claims are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and will not be recommending it to family or friends in the near future.Not so much.

            <li> So after reading the reviews before I purchased this, I thought I would notice some difference in my skin after using it for a while. After almost a month of using this product, I do not notice any difference what&#x27;s so ever with my texture, pores being smaller and lines decreasing. In fact, I find this product makes my skin oily and feels weighed down. Honestly, it&#x27;s so hard to judge a product based on the reviews as my review is going to be completely opposite of what others are saying. I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it and didn&#x27;t notice any difference from a $20 product I&#x27;ve used in the past. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for the past ten years, and I lived in Europe and tried different stuff from around the world. My work gives us  free samples from various companies, and  a month ago I got this. I&#x27;ve always loved Philosophy and DDF for my skincare. So I wasn&#x27;t sure how&#x27;d I feel about this.  Just after a month I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve also gotten so many complements on how clear and glowing it looks. I&#x27;ve always had dry skin, and I constantly struggle to find a moisturizer that works for me. I don&#x27;t like ones that are too thick or greasy, and by the end of winter my skin has taken a beating. This actually has the moisturizer in the serum. I&#x27;ve always been told I look younger than my age despite having dry skin. I&#x27;m less than a year away from being 30, and my skin looks better then what it did when I was 20. My skin is so smooth and soft. As a huge skin care advocate, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this serum before. I let my mom, who is in her 50s use some of it to try, and within two days she saw a difference in her skin. My mom, unlike me, has really oily skin, but this worked well on her. She didn&#x27;t look greasy at all. I have been a huge Philosophy and DDF fan for the past two years, and I will continue to love some of their products, but this CrÃ¨me de Serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using this product on my face. So I did some digging to find out what other users thought about it. One of my biggest concerns was the fact that the bottle had no ingredient label on it. According to the FDA,  the manufacturers of the product should at least send information about where the ingredients can be found if they are not listed on the samples. Secondly, I read some reviews about some ingredients in the product that causes cancer. I have also found a review here that states that those studies were never conducted on humans. You can read the reviews and make what you want of it.&lt;br /&gt;  As for me?  I am pretty sure that I got just a little bit of that melon from the South of France that Dr. Jean-Lois Sebagh talks about in the commercials. My wrinkles are still the same after using 3/4 of the product. There are two major things that the product does to my face that I am grateful for. Number one, my pores got smaller. And number two, I get that glow after I apply the product on my face. For these two reasons only,  I would spend money on the product. The product leaves my skin very soft and moisturized throughout the day. I have oily skin. It might work differently on somebody with dry skin. There is another thing that I noticed; my pimples  dried up faster while I was using the product.&lt;br /&gt;  I have never heard of anybody getting cancer after using products from the Meaningful Beauty Line. I would suggest that you do your own research before trying this product. Staying young and beautiful is every woman&#x27;s dream. But at what cost?</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of products to improve firmness, moisture and appearance of my face over the years.  Based on the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  I have almost completed using the bottle and I cannot determine that there has been any significant change in moisture retention, firmness or improved appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, feel it working already!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month.  My skin tone has evened out and it looks healthier.  I&#x27;ve been using it at night.  The product has a good feel and does not feel &#x27;oily&#x27;.  I intend to buy more.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum, my skin looks good when I first apply it on my face, BUT it seems my skin gets a little dry quickly; the serum really does not moisturize my face well, and the look my skin has when I first put the serum on fades away after a couple of hours. I will continue to use it and see what happens. Maybe I am just use to moisturizers and this is a serum so its a little different. I will make my choice after my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I love thus product and what it does for your skin but it&#x27;s not very moisturizing at all. Once you apply if on your skin it sinks right in and your face feels the same way it does after you washed it. Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing though. It could be  because I have dry/combination skin. This would be great for normal and oily skin. It&#x27;s great for dry skin too you just can&#x27;t use this alone. Just use your moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve had random people tell me how good my skin looks since using this.</li>
            <li> I this product wasn&#x27;t in any way special or different from any other face cream I&#x27;ve used. I also did not like the smell, it was too strong.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love Creme De Serum.  I use it everyday.  I have noticed a big different in my skin. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have used many a product in my day. But this is just amazing. The first time you put it on, your skin is just beautiful. And I am no spring chicken. It is not greasy or oily. Just beautiful. I give it out to my girlfriends for Christmas. Thank you Cindy Crawford.</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin.  Like the way my skin feels when I put it on at night.  Sometimes I use it in the morning also.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on any product becasue they have not worked for me HOWEVER this Creme De Serum is fantastic.  I have a large age spot on my upper cheek and since I started using this product it as lessened in color.  I can see the difference and I have used it only 3 wks.  I certainly intend to keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I add more to this review it would be to say they I totally agree with Marie Osmond \\&quot;I am greedy and I use it twice a day\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> expensive moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at a decent enough budget to do the full autoship of Meaningful Beauty. So I thought I&#x27;d try the serum first... since it was top seller in the line. I decided to order it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and its worth the financial sacrifice. My face is soft and young all day long. It keeps my skin top notch all day! Some of the top skin serums at Sephora don&#x27;t even measure up. I&#x27;m going to keep this on my shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> helps skin stay young looking and gives a little glow to your face</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of use these two products my family couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting me as to how young my skin looked. They told me I looked rejuvenated as if I had gotten rid of all my worries.... I love the product and will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Love the product but the company stinks. I used this because after having my daughter I had terrible hormone blotches on my face (at least to me they were horrible). The product REALLY worked and I have hardly any spots left after using for 2 months. I like the smell a lot too. HOWEVER. They never sent my &amp;#34;after 90 days&amp;#34; supply, and then I got a whole new kit for $49.95, and the billing was completely screwed up. I called to complain and they told me first they could reduce the price on future shipments. I said no, and they said to send it back, but that credits take 4-6 weeks! I told them that was robbery. I sent my unwanted kit back, and it&#x27;s been 5 weeks and no refund yet. So I have to fax my info to the accounting department as proof of shipment. I have always really liked Cindy Crawford and am really surprised she would attach her name to such a badly run company.</li>
            <li> It was only a week of using Meaningful Beauty crÃ¨me when I got my first notice. The longer I use the product the better I look. This product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> My skin says yummy! I love it. I put this on first, then follow with the day cream.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the amount of people that believe this product. The only reason Cindy looks like she does, is because she spends a fortune on plastic surgery</li>
            <li> Love this, makes your skin feel soft, it is expensive, but does work well</li>
            <li> Good for my skin but too expensive.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have ordered this twice.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast price is right, wife loves it.</li>
            <li> First of all, This skin care line- products are not organic in any way!!!!  Full of chemicals...chemicals and more chemicals. Please let me educate women everywhere !!! If a skin care product does not start with distilled or any purification water it&#x27;s not a bad idea to run.  I always tell my clients if you cannot understand, pronounce any of the ingredients, then what are you really buying????.....Secondly, you want a product to be Sterile i hope???? Thirdly, You want a company that cares , and the company&#x27;s honesty!!  Lastly, please ladies read the ingredients and know what you are buying?? If you investigate these  ingredients  that  these products carry, you would be Appalled!!!!!  Example there&#x27;s parabens. in these products!!! Do your homework please stop being fooled .</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and recently attended a family wedding. My sister-in-law asked me why I had no wrinkles. I didn&#x27;t have the chance to tell her that I use Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM. But, I plan to buy it for her as a gift. I want to spread the joy--I am very pleased the way my skin has responded to this serum. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Felt good on skin but did nothing older women need a stronger product to get any noticeable results . fuzz lights would help too</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from this site but from the actual supplier. The shipment took almost 3 weeks and they automatically sign you up for renewal monthly which I wasn&#x27;t aware of and didn&#x27;t know until I got a letter saying they were shot on inventory and couldn&#x27;t guarantee when they could send it out to me.  I bought the whole package which included eye cream, wrinkle cream for cheats and neck, creme de serum and these little capsules that apparently are infused with this melon stuff.  I used all of it religiously for about a month now and I have not seen any improvements or differences at all in my skin.</li>
            <li> Both products, CrÃ¨me De Serum and Meaningful Beauty Lifting Eye Creme are satisfactory although I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on my face or eyes. When you put it on, your skin does feel softer, but not sure if it decreases the visibility of wrinkles. For the price, I&#x27;ve tried better. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> What I like about the serum is it&#x27;s non-greasy formula. It soaks right in leaving my skin smooth. My skin has a tendency to be oily by midday now I don&#x27;t worry anymore. The serum can be worn day and night, I do use a different eye cream directly around my eyes since this product can make the eye area puffy if you put it too close under the eye and on the lid. The serum helps with the crows feet and my makeup stays better without all the facal oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some drug store face moisturizers as well as some &#x27;natural&#x27; moisturizers you can get at a coop or natural food store, but for me, I always come back to the Meaning Beauty serum. It doesn&#x27;t have sun screen so added protection is a must when out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is finicky, whether it be because of the weather or age. I&#x27;m now in my 50&#x27;s and have noticed a real difference with my skin and for some reason the Meaningful Beauty works well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait before giving this review. My face is much softer and 2 weeks of use. My sun spots are lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Do I think  it is good moisturize. NO.&lt;br /&gt;The softness only last for the day. The next morning it felt a bit dry. ( i must say I live in an apartment and it gets very dry).</li>
            <li> I found my skin was allergic to this.</li>
            <li> I feel very dry skin and use it in the morning, it is non greasy and seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Use this serum for great skin.  Great anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim.  Tried it and it burned my skin.  My schedule was hectic and I forgot about this disappointing product.  Now it is too late to return.  Wish this company was like QVC - because returns are never a problem with QVC.  Now I am out $$$ for a product that I will never use.</li>
            <li> This really seems to be working. It is not greasy and absorbs right away. I have only used it for 3 weeks so I am anxious to see the results with a  little longer use.</li>
            <li> nice and silky-----never want to use anything else</li>
            <li> I like this allot.  My skin looks and feels better.  The lines and wrinkles are not so deep as they were, they are by no means gone, but they do look better.</li>
            <li> Glowing and Youthful look. Recommended to anyone looking for that Glowing look. She had used it for a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, but after 2 months using it, I have seen no difference. I would say it is a good moisturizing agent, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the $30/ounce! It also goes very quickly, absorbs fair, but doesn&#x27;t leave a silky smoothness like some other serums do. I am just glad I didn&#x27;t sign up for the monthly delivery of the products. However, the smell of the product is really nice.</li>
            <li> I placed my order &amp; was told from the beginning the cost of $39.00 I tried the product not happy I  was billed almost $100.00 so I cancelled any future orders and was not expecting any further issues 3 month later I was charged $55 which I called &amp; they said they were sending out my 3 month supply I advised I had cancelled they showed no record.(how convent for them). This caused my bank to be over draw $35. I hadn&#x27;t received the product yet but they  said when I do all I need to do is return it &amp; I would get my refund I received the product about 3 days later &amp; returned it that day. I was never told that it would take up to 4-6 weeks to get the refund nor was I told that there may be another charge it has been 3 weeks &amp; I was charged another $55. I called Meaningful beauty now for the 3rd time and was told this was my 2nd payment of 3 installments because they haven&#x27;t received the shipment back. They would send me an affidavit  to sign &amp; return (I wasn&#x27;t told this the 1st time)...Then they would refund my money...I am having surgery today and not once did they apologize for the stress of this matter or even try to refund the money back into my account....I hope Cindy Crawford doesn&#x27;t realize how rude &amp; uncaring the people are that work for her product.  I am in customer service for a major phone company...I know there are things that each person can do to satisfy a customer because I do it every day...They could have processed the refund &amp; the overdraft charge but they didn&#x27;t &amp; couldn&#x27;t guarantee I wouldn&#x27;t be charged the 3rd installment of $55 in April. Because according to the manager the Post Office can take up to 6-8 weeks to return a package.  My next step will be to go to the news with this if I get charged that $55 or if the refund is not back in my account within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> great product but a touch pricy from the seller</li>
            <li> I brought this 2months ago at Ulta and thought I would give it a try.Well let me say this is an amazing product so I went a head and ordered the 1oz bottle on Amazon and i love it!!I&#x27;m 37 and started to notice small lines but the difference it has made all around is great the lines are gone and my skin looks great do try it now it won&#x27;t disappoint u!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea of this actually works but I use all the time. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the way this moisterizer maks my skin look and feel. Its really different from other products you commonly find in stores. Still, fo this small tube, I beleive it is overpriced but obviously I still buy it. I would rate it a 5 star if it were more like $20 and not $35.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews for things, but I had to for this. About 1.5 years ago I got talked into buying some expensive exfoliating face scrub infused with diamonds from some smooth talking snake of a sales woman of a skin care boutique in nyc&#x27;s soho neighborhood where I work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve always had amazing skin. All my life. I&#x27;ve never had acne or terribly uneven skin tone or even wrinkles (I&#x27;m 34)... But this sales woman managed to convince me that I MUST use the face stuff because it looked mike my skin started to need help. Fast forward a couple months with once a week application and my face had developed acne. ACNE! For the first time in my life, in my 30s, I got acne. And I got wrinkles. It baffled my family (my dad has aphasia and was still able to communicate that my skin had gone to hell), and my boyfriend, who just seemed confused by his adult gf going though some very teenaged skin drama. It was VERY embarrassing to leave the house without some coverup, bb cream, or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past year I&#x27;ve been dealing with this bad skin and trying to figure out what to do about this acne. I tried a bunch of stuff from the doctor, more creams, and more exfoliants... Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes work as a DJ for special events and DJed this random fashion week event a few years ago. The pay was meh, but they tried to make up with that with a gift bag filled with stuff and the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty was in there and the the past few years it&#x27;s sat in my product wasteland littered with other freebies. I finally had to go through that wasteland during a major cleaning task and after finding that stuff I decided to give it a try because why the eff not? I also wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of those ads I constantly see and be like &amp;#34;pssh that ish DOES NOT work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well people, it does, and it&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny. My acne and the spots that seemed to scar where volcanic pimples once stood are quickly disappearing if not completly gone! No joke. Like, I can&#x27;t believe it. I was honestly going to get on lifebooker and get an appt to have those giant red skin spots from massive pimples laser removed before my brothers wedding because I had given up hope that they&#x27;d ever go away, but literally less than a month after using this stuff they have!!!! And my skin is smoother with a more even tone and my wrinkles are less prominent (I still get carded so they&#x27;re not that bad, but I would rather get carded all the time rather than sometimes... Plus my 40 year old boyfriend looks about 34/35 so I couldn&#x27;t look my age either!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I apologize that this review is not from a verified purchaser because I got the stuff for free and after nearly a month I&#x27;ve hardly gone through half the bottle so I&#x27;m in no rush to repurchase, but I will be a return customer! I&#x27;m seriously saving so much money in other stuff that now I can drop the $$$ without batting an eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again. A++++are quickly disappearing if not completly gone! No joke. Like, I can&#x27;t believe it.

            <li> I love the creme de serum. Leaves my skin feeling soft and you can see results within just a week or two. My skin has been very oily since I had a hysterectomy and I have never had oily skin or acne issues till after surgery. I have tried several products to help reduce the oil and breakouts and they either didn&#x27;t work or I had a reaction to the salicylic acid in it. I began to become very frustrated till I started using meaningful beauty. I am in love and will never use any other product again.</li>
            <li> The product is good. Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> this product really works it&#x27;s amazing!!!I recommend this product to anyone fighting the aging process please try it ..you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Feels so good on your face. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days however and do not know what  long term use will do yet.</li>
            <li> Reviewer DG gets credit for my purchasing this product. After reading her review, I just had to find out about this unnamed \\&quot;cancer-causing\\&quot; ingredient. Turns out to be cyclopentasiloxane--a lightweight, silky silicone compound that is widely used as an emollient and conditioner in skin and hair products. According to TruthinAging, \\&quot;You can mostly find [it] in ... foundation, facial moisturizer/lotion, hair dye, shampoo/conditioner, styling gel, anti-frizz treatment, sunscreen, anti-aging treatment and deodorant/antiperspirant.\\&quot; Feeling as if you need to throw out ALL of your personal care products? Not so quick. Cyclosiloxanes are everywhere--\\&quot;ubiquitous\\&quot; according to a 2008 report to a CA environmental study panel. You can&#x27;t avoid them. The real question is, can cyclopentasiloxane (\\&quot;D5\\&quot; for short) cause cancer? According to a 2005 Dow Corning study, it can--if you are a female rat that breathes 160 ppm of it constantly for a year or two. But if you are human? Well, not so much. You see, the mechanism by which D5 is thought to cause cancer in rats (attaching to dopamine receptors, which ultimately reduces progesterone levels and leads to uterine tumors) doesn&#x27;t exist in humans, according to scientific researchers. In fact, I could find no evidence (or even an explanatory theory) that D5 can cause cancer in people. Purists may want to stay away from the stuff here and in a thousand other products (and live in a bubble to avoid exposure via the environment). Others might be interested to know that D5 is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to toxic dry cleaning chemicals. So, unless you have the biology of a female lab rat . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 3/12/13: This is a hoot. I just checked the ingredients in a lotion given out by our local hospital&#x27;s cancer support unit to help PREVENT cancer. It contains cyclopentasiloxane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a wonderfully smooth, if expensive, indulgence. The picture fascinated me; I was curious to see those pink and white spirals suspended in solution.  Minor disappointment here. The merchandise I received wasn&#x27;t as \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; as the picture. (The pink is more of a pale salmon color and an air bubble had mooshed part of the strands so they are not as clean as shown.) I guess for the price I expected perfection. Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality, so I really couldn&#x27;t take off a star for that. And the effects are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the morbidly curious like me, here is a list of all 44 ingredients--45 if you count yellow and reddish-brown iron oxide pigments as two different things:&lt;br /&gt;Water, cyclopentasiloxane, glycerin, neopentyl glycol diheptanoate, pentylene glycol, castor isostearate succinate, butylene glycol, polymethylsilsesquioxane, C30-45 alkyl cetearyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer, cucumis melo (melon) fruit extract, elaesis guineensis (palm) oil, sodium hyaluronate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, soluble collagen, maltooligosyl glucoside, decarboxy carnosine HCl, hexapeptide-9, tripeptide-3, saccharomyces/zinc ferment, cholesterol, tocotrienols, tocopherol, tocopheryl acetate, lecithin, caprylyl glycol, hydrogenated vegetable oil, dimethicone, ethylhexylglycerin, silica dimethyl silylate, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, ethylhexyl hydroxystearate, hydroxypropyl guar, glyceryl acrylate/acrylic acid copolymer, polysilicone-11, carbomer, triethanolamine, hexylene glycol, denatured alcohol, disodium EDTA, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, iron oxides (ci77491, ci77492), and titanium dioxide (ci77891).</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so good. It goes on almost like velvet and makes my skin feel so soft without any greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, savings through Amazon is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but absolute success with this product.  I was skeptical, as with any new product, but I was pleasantly surprised when after a week, my skin started looking fresh and yes, younger.</li>
            <li> Use after cleansing before moisturizing. I exfoliate more as this goes to work quick at regenerating the cells, you really need to do this and moisturizer to have it work properly. Buy only from Amazon as Guthy Reinker is no longer to be trusted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months now. There is no change at all with my lines and they are not deep. How this could have worked so well for others and \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; for me is questionable?</li>
            <li> The product makes your face feel very silky and youthful. I enjoy using it very much! I&#x27;m thinking of trying her entire product line.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products! They do exactly what they claim and my skin looks and feels considerably younger! Thank you Cindy Crawford and your amazing team!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have only used it for about 2 weeks, but it seems to be helping!</li>
            <li> meaningful beauty has to be one of the worst products I have ever tried, not sure what was worse, the acne or that it looked like I smeared vaseline all over my face. Definitely not worth the price, I could not see any benefits with this product at all.</li>
            <li> really nice smooth product -- too soon to see any results yet its only been 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, been using it for years and my skin is sensitive, and leaves it smooth and silky. Not to mention, its really helped keeping the wrinkles away. Does not let me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really shocked that Cindy Crawford is even a part of this product. I think it hurts her image and brand. I don&#x27;t know if she REALLY was a part of creating this stuff, and if she was, shame on her. Bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says and leaves your skin really really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, beware of how you order. They love to send out additional product AND charge your credit card over and over and good luck trying to get it all sorted out. You&#x27;ll be sorry you ever placed an order.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to notice its &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; power, but it definitely causes my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I really believe in this product and have been using it for over a year.  I do get compliments on how young I look.</li>
            <li> been using for one month and no visible change</li>
            <li> love it but very expensive</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. it&#x27;s the best serum ive ever come across. it gives your face a natural, warm glow. out of all of her products, i prefer the serum</li>
            <li> The product is silky smooth, but has a terrible odor. Best way to describe it is a new vinyl shower curtain, placed in the microwave and melted. Has a list of ingredients comparable to a vinyl shower curtain, too.&lt;br /&gt;Makes no visible changes and not that moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
            <li> love it have used it for over a year now seen a big difference will keep using</li>
            <li> Pricy, but seems to work.</li>
            <li> Better than advertised, arrived quickly, well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone, fantastic skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;Saw the original ad for this at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
            <li> The meaningful beauty products are mediocre at best.  Like others have said, it smells bad and the claims of fewer lines/wrinkles don&#x27;t seem to be true - at least they weren&#x27;t in my experience.  Buyer beware of ordering through the meaningful beauty web site.  You&#x27;re set up with auto shipments - which is fine.  Except the sales person told me I&#x27;d be paying the introductory price for every shipment.  Sounded like a great deal.  What she should have said is ever shipment made you make 3 payments of that introductory price.  So, instead of costing $50+ a shipment, it costs $160+. It&#x27;s just broken down into smaller monthly payments.  I canceled in October and I&#x27;m still being billed - so getting them to actually cancel your auto shipments is a joke.  I would NOT buy this product - not worth the price tag and I would NOT recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and how quickly it arrived</li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty CREME DE SERUM made my skin very soft and  glowing.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t do anything for me but I didn&#x27;t continue it beyond two weeks because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I didn&#x27;t realize I got in a perpetual program where I would get a package every month and a charge for it.  When I tried to cancel they were not helpful. It sounded like I was talking to a recording.  Be very careful dealing with this company.  You may end up a customer for life. The company rips off customers.  Run don&#x27;t walk...away!</li>
            <li> Creme de Serum is truly an amazing product. I am so glad Amazon.com offers it. I always hesitate by claims of products changing your skin, but this product delivers. I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 weeks, this is my second bottle and I have had numerous complements out of the blue about my skin.</li>
            <li> I love all of the meaningful beauty products.  I have not been disappointed yet and I wish I would have started using them 20 years ago</li>
            <li> I was using this serum for 6 months and had a noticeable difference in fine lines and skin softness. Had several compliance on my complexion even by my Dr.  Ran out and began using another product. After a few weeks noticed lines began to return and was looking sparkle. Order yesterday and received today. How do they do that?  For me this works and will not run out again. Complements not compliance,sorry</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin very smooth and it has diminished lines  - I also use the eye serum and will buy these products again</li>
            <li> This is the best.I love how my skin feels so smooth and healthy.Can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday.I chose to apply this wonderful product twice a day - in the am and then before I go to bed at night.I could put my whole body in a big tub and just soak in it</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Exactly as described. Very happy</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Used for 2 weeks now and my face feels soft. Wrinkles does not look any different as of yet</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My dermatologist even noticed my skin is more hydrated. Did not tell her I was using until after she said something.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY, TOO EXPENSIVE ! NOTHING I WOULD USE AGAIN ,BUT MY FACE FEELS THE SAME.AND BY IT THRU AMAZON! N</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Meaningful Beauty 0 stars if I could since 1 is even a stretch.  I purchased this and other products directly through the company and now they&#x27;ve made it impossible to cancel future orders.  Additional products keep getting shipped to my house and my credit card keeps showing $50 charges.  I have called numerous times and keep getting the runaround.  I feel cheated and scammed and at a total loss as to how to resolve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can these products be quality when the company clearly has no ethics?  I&#x27;m shocked that Cindy Crawford puts her name on this.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product. After a week of religious use. My skin was noticeably worse. My pores were huge. My tiny wrinkles seemed enhanced. I switched back to my normal regime and within two days it was back to normal. May work for some, but not this gal</li>
            <li> very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, and have no problem with this.  I glow!  Wish I had a vat of it.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of all the Meaningful Beauty products but this one I love!  You can get great deals on Amazon rather than buying complete kits of things you don&#x27;t use from their website.  They say you can buy individual products but I can&#x27;t find how to do it - if it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s well hidden!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  I had ordered the entire Meaningful Beauty kit at one time but really only liked the serum and the daily moisturizer.  When I stopped using the serum, I noticed a negative difference in my skin. So I decided to look on Amazon.com to find just the serum and found it at a good price. A lot of products claim to do this or that and you really don&#x27;t see much difference, but this actually makes my skin look softer and smoother and fine lines less noticeable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is constantly advertised on tv.  Coming from a guy I&#x27;ve had a chance to recognize most if not all before pictures of actors are shown with no makeup v. the after pictures of actors wearing makeup.  That&#x27;s an unfair presentation.</li>
            <li> i dont think it works..lol</li>
            <li> Love this! It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> so far so good....I watched the infomercial with Cindy Crawford...I am hoping my skin quality improves with this product. nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Everyone of these products contains cancer causing -parabens and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; - how very disappointing and outdated! One would think for the cost, these would be safe for women.</li>
            <li> While I was home visiting family my mom insisted that I try this stuff, she bought the entire starter kit and I really really love it! I came home and purchased my own. It makes my skin feel so nice! I feel like my makeup even looked nicer on. For me, being 27 years old I didn&#x27;t purchase this product to reduce pre-existing wrinkles, though here&#x27;s hoping it can prevent some. ;) I have very sensitive skin, and I have allergies and definitely can&#x27;t use scented products so this is great! So far my skin feels really nice! I&#x27;m overall extremely happy with this serum! I purchased mine from amazon since the price tag at places like Ulta is kind of crazy! Definitely worth a try! I would never expect miracles from a cream but it will make your skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin. It is terrible.</li>
            <li> Right on to pearl and to sweetness&#x27;s comment to DG. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this and then I remembered that there are bubble dwellers and I also saw bad reviews from people who obviously didn&#x27;t want to pay their bill. One even went as far as to say they got chicken pox and another&#x27;s chin drooped a whole two inches. So I also did some research and i saw similar info as Pearl and more, and the ingredients are available. So even though l was a little hesitant at first, thank goodness I tried it. Its been three weeks for me and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s now starting to show an actual change in firmness and tone. I&#x27;m so so happy and can&#x27;t wait to see more.  The only part that I didn&#x27;t like as much was the glowing serum as it was a little oily and I have sensitive skin so started getting a pimple. But the creme de serum, neck cream, both eye creams and wrinkle caps were amazing. And believe me my skin is really sensitive. So don&#x27;t listen to the garbage.  It does work and you can&#x27;t die.</li>
            <li> great fragrance....smooth consistency -- only have used it two weeks so far -- skin is smoother -- hopefully the longer I use it, the better the results.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the product and love it,it leaves my skin glowing. It is also great for the neck and chest</li>
            <li> Saw the adds for this and didn&#x27;t want to go the endless recurring shipment route so found this on amazon and ordered. Quite satisfied with the effects although i find i need a good moisturizer over it for the best effect.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say I am a skin care junkie and the biggest skeptic... If I don&#x27;t see results in 2 weeks, I&#x27;m on to the next latest and greatest thing. I have NEVER found anything like this product. Now, the other products in this line, I could do without because I didn&#x27;t see any results... But I fell in love with this product the first time I used it. After using it every night for 2 weeks I noticed a pretty solid change in my skin. It hydrates like no other, and my makeup even looks better and holds better when I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;m only 30 but I had these weird spots under my eyes that were wrinkled and sagging... Thanks to this product, those are now gone after only 2 months! It amazed me and I will never go another day without this product!</li>
            <li> LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER, CONTAINS D5. MY SISTER USED THIS AND DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER!</li>
            <li> How does anyone put things on their face that they cannot pronounce?  This has so many chemicals listed I would be afraid that my skin would fall off.</li>
            <li> I have never had such great customer service - EVER!  This company is the best!  I had a small issue with this product and I received a phone call from them immediately and the issue was resolved instantly!  The product is great, too!  I will DEFINITELY purchase from them again and will tell all of my friends about them. EXCELLENT!  Kudos to you!</li>
            <li> Found it interesting that on the US website, ingredients are NOT listed, but when I googled CCMB ingredients, they came up on the Scandenavian website.  CCMB products are full of SLS and parabens, as well as other questionable ingredients.  This is sad that CC would endorse this product when these ingredients have long been linked to breast cancer and other serious health issues.  Please do your own research on these ingredients (which are unfortunately STILL found in hundreds of beauty/health care/ even &#x27;organic&#x27; beauty products)....don&#x27;t depend on what others say, for your own health&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li> Seems like the authentic Cindy Crawford product.  Cheaper than in the store or online but I still use it sparingly.  Lightweight and smells very nice.  Not at all greasy and I use it around my eyes and on my forhead.  I have seen an improvement in fine lines and skin looks refreshed after use.</li>
            <li> The melon extract really nourish and enhance the skin, I love it. I see the difference in the clarity of the skin.</li>
            <li> great product.  I love the way it makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> Same product as the info commercial without all the hype.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the CrÃ¨me De Serum.... I use it along with the Antioxidant Day CrÃ¨me! The product came quickly....Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> I love this serum it feels great on your skin, the size is what you get with the 5 piece set on auto ship, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> It did nothing. We&#x27;d ha t a scam. I wasted m th money. I will never order this item again</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging.  I can see the difference when I stopped using it.  It decreases the lines and makes my skin softer.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SILKY SOFT AND DOESN&#x27;T BURN THE EYES IF YOU PUT IT AROUND THEM.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, but it&#x27;s way too expensive full price from Cindy Crawford, so I order it here. I noticed results in the first week I used this product. Within a month my skin tone had evened out and my skin looked brighter. I have acne-prone, oily, fair skin for reference.</li>
            <li> Love this . Product my skin feels like silk</li>
            <li> Its smooth and goes on nicely but the one i bought on amazon smells kinda funny. I think it&#x27;s just the way the product is made.</li>
            <li> I have always seen the infomercials and decided to try it. Went on very smooth and felt nice, but didnt see any changes from any other moisturizers. Only used it for 6 weeks though. Cindy Crawford just has good genes!!!!</li>
            <li> I started with a trial of Meaningful Beauty and then found out I would be paying a lot of $$$$$ per month. I love her products but do not use them all. This way I can buy what I want when I need it. Service was great, and came packaged to protect it. I will order all my Meaningful Beauty this way.</li>
            <li> my skin feel great, bridget</li>
            <li> My skin is so wonderful I hardly need this :). Probably has as much to do with vegan diet and lack of stressors as with beauty products, but I like a little extra insurance against the effects of the aging process.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and didn&#x27;t notice anything different. I might as well have been using Oil of Olay, which I liked better than this product. I started using Orogold products and prefer them above all the others I&#x27;ve tried. The eye cream is moisturizing for over 12 hours... Orogold for me!</li>
            <li> I got scammed worse! I called to cancel and they said don&#x27;t worry about it stop using one of the problem products and we will put your account on hold and nothing will happen. But something did happen, I went passed my 60 day money back guarantee so of course when I called today they said sorry you are out of luck. They are not responsible for idiots that believe when someone says your account is on hold it means the guarantee as well. Which is basically what the Supervisor Edward in the Western Penn office said when I asked him how I should have interpreted my account as being frozen. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Really like the Creme De Serum product from Meaningful Beauty it works really well to keep my skin hydrated.  Tried using the whole product line but it made my skin too oily.  This by itself works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good like it probably will order  just not right now thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Creme de Serum every night for less than two weeks now and, after the first few days, developed a kind of burning/dryness/slight redness on my face which is similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced on occasion when I used Retin-A.  My skin looked smooth and soft when using this  but I must have experienced an allergic reaction and it really dried out my skin.  I ordered two more vials of this  but cancelled the order and I won&#x27;t be using this product in the future.  My dermatologist was also not at all impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from infomercial. And ladies let me tell you... the whole kit works.  Now the little capsules I don&#x27;t need they was a bit oily for my skin. But the rest of it is great. This creme DE creamed is soon great. I&#x27;m 52 Years old. I started using this product in January of this year and the following month I turned 52. Now before I started using this product my skin was dull and I had bags and noticeable wrinkles in my face I would put on a lot of makeup to cover it up I looked even older. So I. Have been using the whole kit for three months now. And ladies my wrinkles are gone and the bags are gone I look good. And I use less makeup. I will never use thing else. So try it it works. I look younger and my chest area don&#x27;t look. Wrinkled anymore.</li>
            <li> If you put this product on a sunburn you would be in pain. Use vasoline for better result.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am going full disclosure here. I am 30 years old and have problematic skin my entire life. I have never had compliments on my skin either. Until recently. I have had problems with my tone and coloration over the years and nothing seemed to fix it. I always have/had red areas around my nose and chin and not even the most expensive products worked. I decided that age 30 was a sufficient enough age to start giving anti-aging products a try so I opted for meaningful Beauty first. It was within my budget and one of the first things I had been wanting to try. I have been using it for about 5 weeks now and I don&#x27;t think I can live without it. It feels so wonderful on your skin and its not oily or heavy. It feels as if it belongs there. I am a server at a restaurant at a ski resort. I get people from all sorts of walks of life, including those with a million bucks to spend. Recently I have been getting compliments on my skin from customers and it just lights me up inside. These compliments are coming from women that can afford to buy whatever skin care regimen they may, and they want to know what I am using. MEANING BEAUTY!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference, another product made for young skin. It does feel good when going on. And they pic a spokes person who probably will never age very much.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was skeptical at first, I watched the infomercial and was ok &amp;#34;OK, Ill try it&amp;#34; After a month I really didn&#x27;t notice it, So i sent it back, but when I stopped it and went back to my other creamâ€¦. I was like wow that did realllllllllly workâ€¦ I am going to buy some more!!!</li>
            <li> If this stuff is safe, why does everything I use that has it listed in the top four ingredients cause my eyes to water and feel like a film is on them? I wish it was banned.</li>
            <li> Love love love my Skin has NEVER felt so GOOD :)DEFINITELY will be purchasing again Ty ;)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It glides on and feels great and moisturizes well and I just feel like it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Will use this morning and night going forward.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and enriched.  I love all of the ingredients.  You really feel like you are giving your skin the best.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this almost everyday, i have noticed that my pores look much smaller &amp; my skin tone is a bit more even &amp; also has a bit of a glow.  In fact, oftentimes after i apply it i no longer need foundation or powder.  With that said however, i&#x27;m not seeing any difference, better or worse, in terms of diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles.     I bought the eye cream as well as the wrinkle smoothing capsules &amp; haven&#x27;t seen a bit of difference, good or bad, in terms of wrinkles, crows feet, lines, etc &amp; won&#x27;t buy those again.  Thus far, this is the only product i&#x27;ve tried by Meaningful Beauty that has had any effect on my skin.    I&#x27;d love to know WHY everyone is complaining about how expensive it is.  Are you kidding me?  Go to walmart or your nearest drug store &amp; you&#x27;ll see that many similar products by olay cost maybe a dollar less, if not the exact same price.  I should know b/c i&#x27;ve tried alot of their products &amp; they&#x27;ve done nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful!  Even cleared up a break out my face, caused by other products, within a week.  Works great on the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines and has almost taken one away, the other is half the size.  I use twice a day.</li>
            <li> As, a photographer during the 80&#x27;s when Cindy Crawford was at her hottest and as far as I&#x27;m concerned she still is. I myself was appraoching my 40&#x27;s in 2003 and was searching for a product that would assist me in helping me during this transformation. Being a biracial person it&#x27;s very difficult to locate a product that would help someone in my situation. I was watching her speak of her line of beauty product. Yes, here we go again another celebrity trying to make more money, but as she spoke and I did my research (no I did not buy it the first time out the box) I bought the start up kit for $39.99 and the money back if not happy was good enough for me. Well, as you know people of color age differently than white people when I was in my 20&#x27;s and went into teaching for extra money I was often asked for my student ID. This incident happened well into my 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;m 46 now and can pretty much get away with being 38. Well, I fell in love with everything except small oiled filled balls. My skin is already oily/dry,but everything else PERFECT!!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the CREME DE SERUM is beyond perfection! Where did they come up with this? I love the neck and chesk cream when women who have not taken care of that area, it&#x27;s totally beyong gross! The night cream I actually use it during the day also it goes on so smooth and creamy a little bit of Heaven in that jar. The eye lifter is such a blessing; in my family we have what I call Panda eyes and that stuff is such a blessing actually everything is a true blessing from God I don&#x27;t have a clue as to what I&#x27;d do if it went off the marget. People ask me \\&quot;what are you useing to look so young\\&quot; Cindy Crawford Meaniful Beauty. All they could say is WOW!!!! Black/White everyone. Now, that you see it on Amazon and it cheaper I&#x27;ll be ordering it from here.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for making the product available here so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the company when it comes to sending out a shipment. Please, try it if your skin rejects return it, at least you can say \\&quot;I Tried\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Did not make any significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> i have use this product for over 2 years and really like it, does not cake in your face.  happy to use it</li>
            <li> I bought this, the serum, the eye lift cream and the night cream. After 1 day&#x27;s use, my face was red and I had welts all over my face!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get rid of the almost scar reddish brown marks on my upper cheeks that are still there.  I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  My skin can&#x27;t tolerate retin-A types of products, but this line isn&#x27;t supposed to have that, as I understand it. That&#x27;s why I thought I could use it.  I was WRONG.</li>
