            <li>I used this wig for my Nepeta Leijon cosplay and it preformed perfectly -</li>
            <li>This is an excellent wig!  </li>
            <li>Best thing is the customer service.</li>
            <li>perfect for my zombie bust</li>
            <li>I think this is a good wig for what I paid.</li>
            <li>You kidding me with how gorgeous it is in person.</li>
            <li>this looks gorgeous</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re going out, its good.</li>
            <li>Question: If I have fair skin and freckles, should I dye my hair black?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is coming from China after all, so be sure to plan accordingly!  </li>
            <li>Not the BEST wig on the market, but for what you&#x27;ll pay, it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig and all</li>
            <li>We really liked the wig.  </li>
            <li>, I honestly thought it would be a bit longer which would have bummed me out.</li>
            <li>Styles nicely, as well.</li>
            <li>I liked the style and length of wig.</li>
            <li>VERY BECOMING TO MY FACE STRUTURE</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get a very good look at the back of my head, but the length is great for me, just what I wanted</li>
            <li>Taobaopit has FANTASTIC customer service!  </li>

            <li>I will be buying more on amazon .</li>
            <li>I thought I would love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to give it a better rating</li>
            <li>/&gt;this isn&#x27;t a problem for me at all because I&#x27;ve cut a wig before and am okay with doing so, but&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li>And they gave me a free cap!</li>
            <li>For the most part, I&#x27;ve danced in this thing and did the rock star head bang</li>
            <li>Shedding shedding and more shedding.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how to do the hooks at first, but then I saw to put it through the ribbon strip so its good.</li>
            <li>It looks fine, but it&#x27;s shedding and falling apart.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li>We received many compliments and people thought it was real!  </li>
            <li>Very realistic, I received many compliments on it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is a good wig, it was pretty thick, it fell to about my collar bones, and for the most part it was easy to style (You&#x27;ll have to style the bangs for your own likings anyway).</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and likes being able to cut the bangs just how she wants them.</li>
            <li>I found it comfortable and quite worth the price .</li>
            <li>you know the full forehead block.</li>
            <li>The first thing I am glad to say I was happy with was that it came in a few days</li>

            <li>It is a great product and will definitely look forward to buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Nothing children picture, but still a nice short wig.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter - she wanted it for some fun with her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a problem, they will do whatever they can to make it right.</li>
            <li>I will be styling the wig for a costume, but the photo I shared is what the wig is like right out of the bag.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>It needs trimming if you don&#x27;t want the hair in your eye, I can&#x27;t get it to look exactly like the model, but</li>
            <li>My mom thought it looked like real hair!</li>
            <li>For anyone who see this wig online please know that you are not getting the kind of wig that lays down on both sides as it is shown right here in this picture.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how nice this wig fit my small head !</li>
            <li>I had to style the bangs a little bit but overall its my favorite wig I own</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The wig hardly shed, was soft and silky, and looked amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks pretty natural for a wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product looks nothing like the one on the modle, but it&#x27;s ok, as long as it still &amp;#34; short straight hair&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>and I have a little more to add to my report.</li>
            <li>and it stayed put and fell almost right back into place.</li>
            <li>I still love this wig even if I can&#x27;t wear it every single minute of every single day.f</li>
            <li>My body heat is very high, and its stiffening the wig, which makes me think it won&#x27;t take well to being flat ironed, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>Also, we were quoted 30 days for total order and shipping time, and it arrived nearly two weeks early!</li>
            <li>The wig is really soft and shiny, but I actually like the shine.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll give you the full-fuuuuull of how it handles in daily use a little later on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear it every single minute of every single day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the other thing I also noticed was how long the bangs were!&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re almost down to the length of the back of the wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore it all day at work and never once worried about it slipping.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble finding the front, just put the hooks to the back and there you go!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little long for her</li>
            <li> I even tried other things but to no avail.</li>
            <li> This one I did not like this one due to the middle.of the.head crown look there was.missing hair</li>
            <li> the thing I cannot tolerate is that, when I combed the wig (very carefully), lots of the silk hairs were falling off...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> wait is a month a few days to a week past when you purchase it, so don&#x27;t expect it for a party the next night or something.</li>
            <li> nothing that I did would keep the sides down (as shown in this picture)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to put that down.</li>
            <li> wig answered my question for a lot less money and a lot less angst than a trip to the stylist.</li>
            <li> The hair is so silky, a little too silky that it falls in your face a bit</li>
            <li> but I can always trim a few centimeters off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been a few days its the 18th now</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty soft, and It&#x27;s awfully shiny, which I don&#x27;t mind, but some people prefer it not to.</li>
            <li> but you can tame it or get someone to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its for everyday use</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I bought the wig to chear up my girlfriend who suffers a lot recently, but it turns out this wig is just a joke!!!</li>
            <li> Not good won&#x27;t buy this one again</li>
            <li> short - the wig is terrible..</li>
            <li> I got this for my cosplay for Kanaya Maryam (from Homestuck) as a base</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>

            <li> Not the BEST wig on the market, but for what you&#x27;ll pay, it&#x27;s more than worth it. Also, we were quoted 30 days for total order and shipping time, and it arrived nearly two weeks early! ^w^ Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Used this wig in cosplay for Sei (DRAMAtical Murder).</li>
            <li> Nothing children picture, but still a nice short wig. It is one of the only things i&#x27;ve purchased from china, that actually took the lengthy amount of time it estimated, do expect to wait like 2 months to receive.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent wig!  Very realistic, I received many compliments on it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  It comes with a hair net and stays put on my head.  I wore it all day at work and never once worried about it slipping.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because it does take a long time for the product to arrive.  Not the fault of the company!  It is coming from China after all, so be sure to plan accordingly!  Taobaopit has FANTASTIC customer service!  If you have a problem, they will do whatever they can to make it right. :)  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The wig is really soft and shiny, but I actually like the shine.  It&#x27;s a great wig especially for the price. Make sure to order in advance though it did take over a month to arrive. I will be styling the wig for a costume, but the photo I shared is what the wig is like right out of the bag.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and likes being able to cut the bangs just how she wants them. Best thing is the customer service. I&#x27;ve had overseas shippers try to wriggle out of it if it gets lost in the mail; none of that here. Quick reponse, resend via faster option at their expense.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> I got this for my cosplay for Kanaya Maryam (from Homestuck) as a base so I could style and cut it as wished. This is a good wig, it was pretty thick, it fell to about my collar bones, and for the most part it was easy to style (You&#x27;ll have to style the bangs for your own likings anyway). It&#x27;s pretty soft, and It&#x27;s awfully shiny, which I don&#x27;t mind, but some people prefer it not to. I think this is a good wig for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how nice this wig fit my small head ! I found it comfortable and quite worth the price . I will be buying more on amazon .</li>
            <li> When I looked at this wig online I thought I would love it. The day it came and I tried it on I was so disappointed! the first thing was the inside cap of the wig was so small it would not go over my head and the sides of the wig stayed flipped up on both sides nothing that I did would keep the sides down (as shown in this picture) I even tried other things but to no avail. I would love to give it a better rating but I just cant do it. For anyone who see this wig online please know that you are not getting the kind of wig that lays down on both sides as it is shown right here in this picture.</li>
            <li> The product looks nothing like the one on the modle, but it&#x27;s ok, as long as it still &amp;#34; short straight hair&amp;#34;...the thing I cannot tolerate is that, when I combed the wig (very carefully), lots of the silk hairs were falling off...&lt;br /&gt;I bought the wig to chear up my girlfriend who suffers a lot recently, but it turns out this wig is just a joke!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig and all but I was expecting something something a bit longer.... (I was going to use it for my Terezi Pyrope cosplay) Guess I&#x27;ll use it for Nepeta...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter - she wanted it for some fun with her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - the wig is terrible.. It looks fine, but it&#x27;s shedding and falling apart.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The first thing I am glad to say I was happy with was that it came in a few days early.&lt;br /&gt;It looks pretty natural for a wig.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for a nepeta cosplay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little long for her but I can always trim a few centimeters off.&lt;br /&gt;the other thing I also noticed was how long the bangs were!&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re almost down to the length of the back of the wig.&lt;br /&gt;this isn&#x27;t a problem for me at all because I&#x27;ve cut a wig before and am okay with doing so, but&lt;br /&gt;to anyone purchasing the wig, I&#x27;d watch a video or read a tutorial or two on how to cut a wig if you don&#x27;t like wig hair in your face~&lt;br /&gt;I bought from them before and would definitely do it again and again!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  We really liked the wig.  We received many compliments and people thought it was real!  It is a great product and will definitely look forward to buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> You kidding me with how gorgeous it is in person. The hair is so silky, a little too silky that it falls in your face a bit but you can tame it or get someone to. I didn&#x27;t know how to do the hooks at first, but then I saw to put it through the ribbon strip so its good. And they gave me a free cap! Yeah boy! I&#x27;ve been meaning to buy one of those but never got around to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wait is a month a few days to a week past when you purchase it, so don&#x27;t expect it for a party the next night or something. Like this: I ordered it 10/5/2013 and today is 11/9/2013 see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get a very good look at the back of my head, but the length is great for me, just what I wanted, I honestly thought it would be a bit longer which would have bummed me out. The cap is a cage cap. That means your head can breath if you don&#x27;t wear the wig cap. I wonder how it handles heat because the edges curl a bit and I&#x27;d like to put that down. It needs trimming if you don&#x27;t want the hair in your eye, I can&#x27;t get it to look exactly like the model, but I&#x27;ll try- you know the full forehead block. I swiped mine to the side. If you&#x27;re having trouble finding the front, just put the hooks to the back and there you go! I&#x27;m black, so if you are too, or you have a darker complexion because you&#x27;re not Asian or you are Asian with a darker skin tone this looks gorgeous so don&#x27;t worry if its not for you- it IS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only got it today, so I&#x27;ll give you the full-fuuuuull of how it handles in daily use a little later on. So wait for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been a few days its the 18th now and I have a little more to add to my report. I&#x27;m not sure if its for everyday use but if you&#x27;re going out, its good. My body heat is very high, and its stiffening the wig, which makes me think it won&#x27;t take well to being flat ironed, but we&#x27;ll see. For the most part, I&#x27;ve danced in this thing and did the rock star head bang and it stayed put and fell almost right back into place. I still love this wig even if I can&#x27;t wear it every single minute of every single day.f I can&#x27;t wear it every single minute of every single day.</li>
            <li> I received this wig and when I opened up the pack, hair instantly started coming off he wig. Shedding shedding and more shedding. This was a waste of money..</li>
            <li> The wig hardly shed, was soft and silky, and looked amazing! My mom thought it looked like real hair! Styles nicely, as well. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I liked the style and length of wig.I  would recommend others to shop from you. VERY BECOMING TO MY FACE STRUTURE</li>
            <li> Question: If I have fair skin and freckles, should I dye my hair black?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer: NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig answered my question for a lot less money and a lot less angst than a trip to the stylist.</li>
            <li> This one I did not like this one due to the middle.of the.head crown look there was.missing hair and you could see the beige plastic cap. Not good won&#x27;t buy this one again</li>
            <li> perfect for my zombie bust</li>
