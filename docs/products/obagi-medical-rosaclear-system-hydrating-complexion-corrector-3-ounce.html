            <li>Best product for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>This was the best cream I found for the roseacea.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I am really impressed my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Amazon was great with refunding my shipping cost though.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good moisturizer - haven&#x27;t ended up greasy</li>
            <li>I was and still am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied costumer.</li>
            <li>and im glad I did!</li>
            <li>I ran out of Obagi, and to be honest, now that I&#x27;m wearing a &#x27;skin-friendly&#x27; moisturizer, I&#x27;ve stopped wearing complexion correctors and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>Treatment would be nice but this product does nothing to treat the redness.</li>
            <li>i dont even need make-up any more which im more happy about.</li>
            <li>I use the whole system with the cleanser, gel and moisturizer and my skin in nearly flawless.  </li>
            <li>perfect for light rosecea problems--just enough medication if prescription is not needed,light coverage for redness--replaces foundation, and perfect moisterizer if oil-free has been suggested for you</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Obagi for making a great product...    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the complexion corrector.  </li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping great seller thanks</li>
            <li>but I put it on at the beginning of the day and by night my skin looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as a lot of moisturizers i have used, but is fine when used in combination with a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>IT cosmetics makes a lovely redness corrector that works far better than this stick stuff.</li>
            <li>I loved Obagi product and use their Hydrate religiously.  </li>
            <li>The redness is not completely gone, but it&#x27;s kind of on background, not as prominent and all.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my daughters who have very sensitive skin, their results have been astonishing.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this line of skin care products via a reputable skin care professional who works for a very reputable plastic surgeon in Central Ohio.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cover for your complextion but I&#x27;n not sure if it really changes your skin for the better.</li>
            <li>It also acts as a great foundation for men who might like add a little color to their cheeks after application.  </li>
            <li>I used this cream right after washing my face with Obagi cleanser (see my comment for that product).</li>
            <li>First, I have the most sensitive skin along with being allergic to almost all moisturizers I have tried.</li>
            <li>I needed something that will help m red prone skin cuz it was really bad.i use to cry cuz nothing would work for me.so once i tried the Obagi rosaclear cream it worked amazing.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks smooth and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well at covering up a bit of the redness I get from using acne products.</li>
            <li>After FIRST application - i got a compliment, the redness was gone...</li>
            <li>I can finally say that the Obagi product worked so much better</li>
            <li>I have used this for the last 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products convinced I could control it without having to spend a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this product more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to control redness from my rosacea only to be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>but once it dries it blends right in and really helps mask and soften my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I originally found this at a thrift store and gave it to my mother who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even work very well as a night moisurizer as the white residue just lays on top and never absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I also pair this with other brand names and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Also, no breakouts - and i have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most products and as I was aging, my skin was dry but until now, I could not find something to use.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you ask your dermatologist first and sample the product in their office.</li>
            <li>but I am very dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is far more reasonable to purchase these products via Amazon versus buying directly from a skin care professional.</li>
            <li>If you really think this product might do something for you</li>
            <li>I realized I use way to much of it and</li>
            <li>It really does help relieve redness and it keeps it away.</li>
            <li>Use it with the Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>i spent so much money on iS clinical products that were 10x more money than obagi.</li>
            <li>I mean the company&#x27;s page seems to have good reviews.</li>
            <li>man it helps out a lot more than any other product ive ever used.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do its job or live up to its name!</li>
            <li>I use this and a high SPF lotion and my skin (at 60) gets compliments.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t review except to say it hasn&#x27;t reduced the redness in my naturally ruddy complextion much.</li>
            <li>If you cant smooth it out just wash your hands and add a little moisture to it.</li>
            <li>I do like to use it to hide the redness of my face, but I want something to clear my skin and give me a even skintone&#x27;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never felt so hopeful about having clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would clear up my skin</li>
            <li>It really helps to balance out skin tones and to reduce redness from things such as rosacea.  </li>
            <li>It is far from a cure from rosacea, but</li>
            <li>This rosaclear Complexion cream for roscea really help with my red blotchy skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that really keeps my flair ups in check.  </li>
            <li>I use very little and it goesa on easily.</li>
            <li>That said,  this product has been very soothing to my skin over the long haul and the redness reducer is a god-send.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to put too much on though, because it will give you a chalky appearance that people will notice!</li>
            <li>only a pea size amount is necessary for me to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those with low to moderate rosacea or going through hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>I recently bought all natural products; moisturizer, cleanser, and toner from a Apothecary.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my sensitive rosacea under control.  </li>
            <li>The more you try to blend the worse it gets.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is good(not too thick, not too light).</li>
            <li>Will not pay more than $25, its ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Today, after a few days of using it, i&#x27;m wearing no foundation for the first time in ages.</li>

            <li> Today, after a few days of using it, i&#x27;m wearing no foundation for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago and didnt like it because it left a white residue and never gave it another try.</li>
            <li> The color is a pinkish grey and it is pretty thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> A couple of other reviews mentioned that this Rosaclear lotion was chalky, but it left a ghost white residue all over my face.  </li>
            <li> But long term, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> If I stop using it, the Rosacea returns; but as long as I&#x27;m on it</li>
            <li> I have very pink cheeks - not related to roseacia, but&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was assuming it would only last a few hours</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased the Obagi</li>
            <li> i like this moisturizer, it definitely tones down my redness and evens tone.</li>
            <li> It makes the complexion less red if you apply it before putting on your makeup.  </li>
            <li> about 70% less red.</li>
            <li> I seen her the next week and her skin was less rough looking and</li>
            <li> I have to use little to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> Well I dug deep into my medicine cabinet a few days ago and decided to give it another shot</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is reducing the pink color.  </li>
            <li> so the money wasn&#x27;t a complete waste; but the money was completely wasted.</li>
            <li> I grudgingly waited until I used a significant portion of this product before telling this truth.</li>
            <li> Has not caused any flare ups or break outs which I have had problems with almost every other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a bit drier, but nothing like after using other rosacea products.</li>
            <li> I like other color correctors.</li>
            <li> Living in Southern CA with a reddish skin tone and former skin cancer is tough.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight purple color for color correction.</li>
            <li> I look a little ghostly</li>
            <li> Though the color correction is minimum, I do believe it helps a little.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it to anyone who suffers like I did.</li>
            <li> The product tends to make one look a little pale when</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times on amazon,the only disappointing thing about this product is that as time goes by I have seen a rapid increase in price.</li>
            <li> My doctor put me on the rosaclear system a few years ago and I no longer have to deal with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Drs don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin, but this gets the red out.</li>
            <li> The redness seems to have decreased.  </li>
            <li> Dealing with the redness and acne is really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with product.  </li>
            <li> I found this terribly difficult to blend on to my face - rolling up and balling off with or without products layered underneath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Trick is to use a VERY small amount or it will roll up and look bad.</li>
            <li> This product is not too bad for covering up redness.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my makeup base.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience with the company who gave me an invalid tracking number, wouldn&#x27;t respond to emails, and priority shipped my purchases 17 days after my purchase.</li>
            <li> but instead I got the worst zits I&#x27;ve had in years and years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently bought all natural products; moisturizer, cleanser, and toner from a Apothecary. I ran out of Obagi, and to be honest, now that I&#x27;m wearing a &#x27;skin-friendly&#x27; moisturizer, I&#x27;ve stopped wearing complexion correctors and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> Have been using the product at night only.  Has not caused any flare ups or break outs which I have had problems with almost every other product I&#x27;ve tried.  Have been using the sunscreen &amp; cleanser as well.  The redness seems to have decreased.  It&#x27;s been a good moisturizer - haven&#x27;t ended up greasy and my skin looks smooth and feels soft.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I use obagi cleanser and am very happy with it but I am very dissatisfied with this product.  It did not meet my expectations at all.  It does not blend into the skin, leaves a white residue that rolls up and can not be easily brushed off.  The more you try to blend the worse it gets.  It won&#x27;t even work very well as a night moisurizer as the white residue just lays on top and never absorbs into the skin.  Would not recommend this under any circumstances.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well at covering up a bit of the redness I get from using acne products. Trick is to use a VERY small amount or it will roll up and look bad. Im a guy and dont want to look like i am wearing makup. Its tuff to absorb in your skin if your using anything else though(benzoyl peroxide for example)</li>
            <li> This product is not too bad for covering up redness.  Needs to be applied several times a day.</li>
            <li> I used this cream right after washing my face with Obagi cleanser (see my comment for that product). After FIRST application - i got a compliment, the redness was gone... Today, after a few days of using it, i&#x27;m wearing no foundation for the first time in ages. I hope the results will stay. The redness is not completely gone, but it&#x27;s kind of on background, not as prominent and all. I plan on getting a moisturizer from this line and alternate with this Corrector. My skin is a bit drier, but nothing like after using other rosacea products. Also, no breakouts - and i have super sensitive skin. Love it. I am sooooo happy i found this product! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with product.  Sticky feeling.  Did not do what it described and did not help with rosacea.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this line of skin care products via a reputable skin care professional who works for a very reputable plastic surgeon in Central Ohio.  It really helps to balance out skin tones and to reduce redness from things such as rosacea.  It also acts as a great foundation for men who might like add a little color to their cheeks after application.  The product tends to make one look a little pale when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is far more reasonable to purchase these products via Amazon versus buying directly from a skin care professional.</li>
            <li> This is a great cover for your complextion but I&#x27;n not sure if it really changes your skin for the better. I do like to use it to hide the redness of my face, but I want something to clear my skin and give me a even skintone&#x27;</li>
            <li> I grudgingly waited until I used a significant portion of this product before telling this truth. The color is a pinkish grey and it is pretty thick and sticky. It will definitely leave a pink/white film on your face, if that is what you want. I found this terribly difficult to blend on to my face - rolling up and balling off with or without products layered underneath. I ended up using this as a sunscreen on my hands and forearms so the money wasn&#x27;t a complete waste; but the money was completely wasted. However, there is no labeled SPF, although it contains Titanium Dioxide. I did not find this to be hydrating at all. If you really think this product might do something for you I highly suggest you ask your dermatologist first and sample the product in their office.</li>
            <li> It makes the complexion less red if you apply it before putting on your makeup.  But long term, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  Be careful not to put too much on though, because it will give you a chalky appearance that people will notice!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have rosacea and I was hoping for a cream that wasn&#x27;t a prescription to help take away the redness.  This helps, but not totally.  It also seems to leave a white residue - the way sunblock with titanium does.</li>
            <li> My husband has Rosia and had been using RX medicine I heard about this line of product and now he doesn&#x27;t use the RX any longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago and didnt like it because it left a white residue and never gave it another try. Well I dug deep into my medicine cabinet a few days ago and decided to give it another shot and im glad I did! I realized I use way to much of it and only a pea size amount is necessary for me to do my whole face. If you cant smooth it out just wash your hands and add a little moisture to it. It really does help relieve redness and it keeps it away. I was assuming it would only last a few hours but I put it on at the beginning of the day and by night my skin looks pretty good. It is far from a cure from rosacea, but man it helps out a lot more than any other product ive ever used.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;sfoswiss\\&quot; I wonder if it might have been the combination of this product and your sunscreen.  My skin was also irritated using the Rosaclear Hydrating Complexion Controller AND the Rosaclear Sunscreen (which contains zinc) together.  I now use a different sunscreen with the Complexion Controller and when I&#x27;m going to be in the sun for an extended period, I JUST use the Rosaclear sunscreen.  That said,  this product has been very soothing to my skin over the long haul and the redness reducer is a god-send.  I suggest giving it a try.</li>
            <li> All this stuff does is (supposedly) decrease the appearance of redness. Treatment would be nice but this product does nothing to treat the redness. I like other color correctors. IT cosmetics makes a lovely redness corrector that works far better than this stick stuff.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most products and as I was aging, my skin was dry but until now, I could not find something to use. I came across this product through Vitology - a medical facility. I use this daily after my shower.</li>
            <li> Best product for my skin type.  My complexion has improved 100%.  I also pair this with other brand names and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times on amazon,the only disappointing thing about this product is that as time goes by I have seen a rapid increase in price. If it keeps going up in price, I will have to look for an alternative! Will not pay more than $25, its ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I am in love with Obagi products.  First, I have the most sensitive skin along with being allergic to almost all moisturizers I have tried. This works for me! And it takes away redness from zits, or pimples.  It has evened out my skin coloring too.  I do not have a leftover oily or greasy feeling either.</li>
            <li> This rosaclear Complexion cream for roscea really help with my red blotchy skin! i spent so much money on iS clinical products that were 10x more money than obagi.I can finally say that the Obagi product worked so much better i dont even need make-up any more which im more happy about.I needed something that will help m red prone skin cuz it was really bad.i use to cry cuz nothing would work for me.so once i tried the Obagi rosaclear cream it worked amazing. Thanks Obagi for making a great product...    Reyna</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my sensitive rosacea under control.  I have used this for the last 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 7 yrs.  It&#x27;s the only thing that really keeps my flair ups in check.  Redness is gone overnight.  Hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin. Drs don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin, but this gets the red out. Use it with the Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I originally found this at a thrift store and gave it to my mother who has extremely sensitive skin. I seen her the next week and her skin was less rough looking and about 70% less red. I had to order for myself. This stuff is made for sufferers of rosasea which I don&#x27;t suffer from, but find a lot of products break me out. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and love it. I have to use little to cover my entire face. It&#x27;s a lavender color so for about two minutes I look a little ghostly but once it dries it blends right in and really helps mask and soften my acne scars. I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with Obagi Cleanziderm facewash and toner and I&#x27;ve never felt so hopeful about having clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;  My only regret is ordering it from Medical 101. I had a horrible experience with the company who gave me an invalid tracking number, wouldn&#x27;t respond to emails, and priority shipped my purchases 17 days after my purchase. Amazon was great with refunding my shipping cost though. I don&#x27;t know, I mean the company&#x27;s page seems to have good reviews. Maybe I was just unlucky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Rosacea for several years now.  Dealing with the redness and acne is really frustrating.  I tried so many different products convinced I could control it without having to spend a lot of money.  I was wrong.  I finally broke down and purchased the Obagi and it really works.  I use the whole system with the cleanser, gel and moisturizer and my skin in nearly flawless.  If I stop using it, the Rosacea returns; but as long as I&#x27;m on it you&#x27;d never even know I have a problem.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone who suffers like I did.</li>
            <li> perfect for light rosecea problems--just enough medication if prescription is not needed,light coverage for redness--replaces foundation, and perfect moisterizer if oil-free has been suggested for you</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I thought it would clear up my skin but instead I got the worst zits I&#x27;ve had in years and years. It didn&#x27;t do its job or live up to its name! The search begins again...</li>
            <li> Have used this product for four months.  I regularly receive compliments on my healthier skin.  I gave this to my daughters who have very sensitive skin, their results have been astonishing.</li>
            <li> Living in Southern CA with a reddish skin tone and former skin cancer is tough.  I use this and a high SPF lotion and my skin (at 60) gets compliments.  This was the best cream I found for the roseacea.  I use very little and it goesa on easily.</li>
            <li> I have very pink cheeks - not related to roseacia, but&lt;br /&gt;this is reducing the pink color.  My foundation goes on&lt;br /&gt;nicely.  I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I actually like this product more than I anticipated. It has a slight purple color for color correction. Though the color correction is minimum, I do believe it helps a little. The consistency is good(not too thick, not too light). I leaves my skin feeling hydrated and relaxed(not irritated) and doesn&#x27;t cause any break outs.</li>
            <li> My doctor put me on the rosaclear system a few years ago and I no longer have to deal with breakouts.  I love the complexion corrector.  I use it under my makeup base.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 5 days and I am really impressed my skin feels and looks great. This product delivers.,and I have tried many products to control redness from my rosacea only to be dissapointed. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I was and still am very pleased with this product.I would recommend this item for any one with a reddish tint to their face.</li>
            <li> I loved Obagi product and use their Hydrate religiously.  A couple of other reviews mentioned that this Rosaclear lotion was chalky, but it left a ghost white residue all over my face.  It did not noticably reduce any redness.  I really want to return it but am having trouble with the seller.</li>
            <li> Good product! Highly recommend to those with low to moderate rosacea or going through hormonal acne. Very satisfied costumer. Rosaclear!</li>
            <li> So I shouldn&#x27;t have purchased this...I needed the Blender.  So I can&#x27;t review except to say it hasn&#x27;t reduced the redness in my naturally ruddy complextion much.</li>
            <li> great product. I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> i like this moisturizer, it definitely tones down my redness and evens tone. it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as a lot of moisturizers i have used, but is fine when used in combination with a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping great seller thanks</li>
