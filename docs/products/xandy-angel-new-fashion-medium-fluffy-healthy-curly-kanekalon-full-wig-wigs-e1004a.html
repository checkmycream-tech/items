    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>, it arrived about a week or two after I ordered which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>It looks perfect with woodland creature makeup~</li>
            <li>I love this wig!!!</li>
            <li>I was waiting for 19 days, and finally , my gorgeous wig arrived!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful wig</li>
            <li>For that price I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as beautiful as it is.  </li>
            <li>However, the material is not that great</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Ohhhh ,I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good for occasions where people expect you to be wearing a wig that will look kinda glossy and plasticy.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to look cheaper to be honest, but it&#x27;s actually really nice quality!</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased when I tried it on</li>
            <li>(I wonder why so many reviewers said that it looks healthy!?!</li>
            <li>I love buying from X&amp;Y Angel!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Even though I still want to get a light brown wig ,just like it.!!</li>
            <li>the color is nice as well..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>so I took matters into my own hands and cut the damage out and made some adjustments.</li>
            <li>This wig is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>love the length, and it&#x27;s nice and wavy just like the picture.</li>
            <li>This wig is a lot of fun and it looks great on.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how beautiful, and realistic it is!</li>
            <li>If is a very light strawberry brown color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very realistic and would make a great day-wear wig, just out and about running errands or whatnot.</li>
            <li>It got me by surprise :)</li>
            <li>but it is more frizzy than the picture.</li>
            <li>I would buy from these folks again :)</li>
            <li>I still love the wig I am going to try some way to fix it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be all curly and in place, I personally love it,</li>
            <li>I have already ordered two more styles</li>
            <li>OH god when it came in I ripped the package open to have of one the BEST wigs I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from X&amp;Y ANGEL again! :D</li>
            <li>But,it is totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>The thing I loved most about this is the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The quality, however is GREAT for the price, the hair is soft and very full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it has a great length to it</li>
            <li>:) I get compliments whenever I wear it out (&amp;#34;your hair is really pretty, it must take you hours to get it so nice</li>
            <li>I got this wig WAY before the expected delivery date, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to wear out:)</li>
            <li>I really liked the light brown color of this wig when I first saw it (picture).</li>
            <li>Looks very healthy and natural, I will add a picture to show the color better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my very first X&amp;Y and I love it</li>
            <li>When it was still wrapped up in the package it looked like a light brown color.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>This was a great wig especially for the price!</li>
            <li>, I LOVE your hair!&amp;#34;) from both guys and girls.</li>
            <li>I was so unbelievable impressed with this wig</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this came in.</li>
            <li>I had been so excited when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Very nice wig..looks real and feels soft...</li>
            <li>The price is right, so is the product, easy to style, and take care of.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice natural shine..</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d really, really, really hoped to find one that was more...</li>
            <li>quick delivery too..</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty much a very lovely , light red color..</li>
            <li>It looks so much like my hair, about 8 years ago!!</li>
            <li>A really great fun everyday wig.</li>
            <li>The very top part is smooth and shiny, but the rest, especially the tip (bottom part) of the hair is absolutely coarse and easy to get tangled.</li>
            <li>The length is right.</li>
            <li>Right color.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so comfortable,  too,and I completely forget I&#x27;m wearing a wig, at all!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>It said it would take a month, but I got it exactly two weeks after I ordered.</li>
            <li>so I gave those a trim first thing.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when I wear this out in public.</li>
            <li>It requires maintenance between wears (brushing/washing) to keep looking neat and not tangled, but that&#x27;s pretty close to real hair</li>
            <li>This look is so pure, it made a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>This is my dream wig, will definitely purchase from X&amp;Y again, they are my new favorite wig shop.</li>
            <li>The wig I receive was straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thinner</li>
            <li>Important to note that it has two chin-length face framing pieces of hair aside the regular bangs</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also arrived MUCH SOONER than I thought it would</li>
            <li>but it cannot and becomes very fried in the areas that you do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a light red auburn color..</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s just not that much hair.</li>
            <li>First , I want to say, the wig shown in their NEW picture is NOT the wig I purchased..</li>
            <li>The curles are realistic because its a bit tangly and real and less glossy, but the top is flat and and smooth and it looks really plasticy.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a red than I expected but the different tones in it make it look a lot more realistic.</li>
            <li>It feels very real, soft but not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, unbelievably soft, comfortable and versatile.  </li>
            <li>They were alittle uneven, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it looked very natural.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised of the quality of your wig.  </li>
            <li>However the wave pattern only lasts as long as you don&#x27;t brush it out (but you need to brush it out as it gets tangled very quickly).</li>
            <li>So basically I got my wig, hoping it looked the exact same...</li>
            <li>Really soft, looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more strawberry dark blonde.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned some pretty expensive nice wigs before.</li>
            <li>The color seems a little too orangie red, but I just love it.</li>
            <li>Its so pretty looks exactly like the photo, it&#x27;s fluffy and soft and realisic.</li>
            <li>A  whole different wig!!!!...</li>
            <li>The cap is roomy,but not too big.. and stays on very well.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>But it is VERY fluffy and insanely full!</li>
            <li>but realistic red..</li>
            <li>I pinned it back like princess hair, left it long and put it in braided pigtails for a sweet punky look.  </li>
            <li>The bangs were really long and needed to be trimmed (but that&#x27;s how it is with pretty much every wig) and it is a bit on the shiny side, especially up near the roots and the crown, but that&#x27;s nothing a little baby/talcum powder can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>It may cost a few dollars more ,than some of the other sellers..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much thinner than other wigs I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>SO very long, and soft, and nice ,loose waves, that don&#x27;t look fake , like some do..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Especially after you brush it (which I recommend doing, as long as you have a wig brush).</li>
            <li> It definitely looks like a wig, not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> The bangs are long</li>
            <li> what pic shows  long bangs you must cut.</li>
            <li> I like the color of the hair but the bangs are too long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am one of those lucky customer who receive the wig that is the same as the one shown with the model.</li>
            <li> my only con is that it do get tangled but other than that</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the shops in town when I can order the same if not better from you.</li>
            <li> I wore it to work and shocked everyone since my own hair is medium length and black.  </li>
            <li> This is not a real X&amp;Y Angel wig.</li>
            <li> It does indeed come with a wig cap and it came a week sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t recieved the right wig and it was completely wrong</li>
            <li> [Silly, right?]</li>
            <li> and there are no tags like my other wigs from this brand.</li>
            <li> When I took it out Holy Cow</li>
            <li> The only thing that i was a little disappointed, was that it wasn&#x27;t the color ,shown in the picture,which looks like a light brown ,to me..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thinner than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any.</li>
            <li> now I want a dark brown one</li>
            <li> Its dark brown and way shorter and, has tight curls (looks like), at the bottom...</li>

            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is there is one thin spot on the back wear</li>

            <li> than the poor qualities:&lt;br /&gt;The color is the same as in the picture</li>
            <li> I simply added some tracks of weaving hair to the cap to fill in the thin spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is too close to my skin tone, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not an absolute awful purchase because I got a wig to mess around with for a affordable price.</li>

            <li> I did receive the wig on time. Unfortunately, I am one of those lucky customer who receive the wig that is the same as the one shown with the model. The wig I receive was straight. The length is right. However, the material is not that great (I wonder why so many reviewers said that it looks healthy!?! Am I really the person with the worst luck in the universe?). The very top part is smooth and shiny, but the rest, especially the tip (bottom part) of the hair is absolutely coarse and easy to get tangled. Hopefully the hair is heat resistant as described so that I straighten it a little so it won&#x27;t look as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an absolute awful purchase because I got a wig to mess around with for a affordable price. Still though, I bought it with a different picture in mind. I was doubtful, and sadly my concern was right :(</li>
            <li> I love this wig!!! It&#x27;s so soft and it has a great length to it XD I love buying from X&amp;Y Angel!</li>
            <li> The thing I loved most about this is the fast shipping. It said it would take a month, but I got it exactly two weeks after I ordered. That&#x27;s great! It got me by surprise :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the length, and it&#x27;s nice and wavy just like the picture. Just ha to brush it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I had to cut the bangs, but that was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found was the color is different than the picture. It&#x27;s more strawberry dark blonde. Not brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice wig..looks real and feels soft...my only con is that it do get tangled but other than that I recommend it...the color is nice as well..quick delivery too..now I want a dark brown one</li>
            <li> This is not a real X&amp;Y Angel wig. It&#x27;s much thinner and there are no tags like my other wigs from this brand. The color is very pretty but it is more frizzy than the picture. It&#x27;s also much thinner than other wigs I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t recieved the right wig and it was completely wrong so I threw it out but I did get a refund so I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to look cheaper to be honest, but it&#x27;s actually really nice quality! It requires maintenance between wears (brushing/washing) to keep looking neat and not tangled, but that&#x27;s pretty close to real hair so whatever :) I get compliments whenever I wear it out (&amp;#34;your hair is really pretty, it must take you hours to get it so nice, I LOVE your hair!&amp;#34;) from both guys and girls. Definitely a good purchase. I would buy from these folks again :)</li>
            <li> I really liked the light brown color of this wig when I first saw it (picture). When it was still wrapped up in the package it looked like a light brown color. When I took it out Holy Cow It is a strawberry blonde color. I still love the wig I am going to try some way to fix it. Bangs need to be trimmed but you get what you pay for I guess. Color is still wow.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I was so unbelievable impressed with this wig it&#x27;s my very first X&amp;Y and I love it, it&#x27;s just as the picture shows, the color is gorgous and the length is just what i wanted..I am so excited to wear out:) I love it!</li>
            <li> So I was worried about this, because wigs can be so iffy but it&#x27;s really nice. Its so pretty looks exactly like the photo, it&#x27;s fluffy and soft and realisic. It does indeed come with a wig cap and it came a week sooner than expected. Plus it&#x27;s so cheap. I definitely say go for it.</li>
            <li> I gasped when this wig fell out of the package.  It&#x27;s long, unbelievably soft, comfortable and versatile.  The bangs are long so I gave those a trim first thing.  Important to note that it has two chin-length face framing pieces of hair aside the regular bangs so that&#x27;s why I used the word versatile.  I pinned it back like princess hair, left it long and put it in braided pigtails for a sweet punky look.  It&#x27;s beautiful.  I wore it to work and shocked everyone since my own hair is medium length and black.  This is my dream wig, will definitely purchase from X&amp;Y again, they are my new favorite wig shop.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the color would be darker. If is a very light strawberry brown color. The quality, however is GREAT for the price, the hair is soft and very full. The color is too close to my skin tone, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived MUCH SOONER than I thought it would, it arrived about a week or two after I ordered which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> The price is right, so is the product, easy to style, and take care of. This look is so pure, it made a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected and I was very pleased when I tried it on and it looked very natural. Color matched the picture. However the wave pattern only lasts as long as you don&#x27;t brush it out (but you need to brush it out as it gets tangled very quickly). Also the bio claims it can be styled with heated irons but it cannot and becomes very fried in the areas that you do. I&#x27;m a hair stylist so I took matters into my own hands and cut the damage out and made some adjustments. Beautiful wig but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Recieved today. a couple inches off what pic shows  long bangs you must cut. Right color. Not as crimpy as shown!</li>
            <li> So basically I got my wig, hoping it looked the exact same... Do not be fooled... I was hoping it would be all curly and in place, I personally love it, But I&#x27;d rather have them show your product before they ship, you know? so you can expect what you are getting in the mail.</li>
            <li> First , I want to say, the wig shown in their NEW picture is NOT the wig I purchased..I dont know why they have this picture there, cos it looks NOTHING like the wig i have!! Its dark brown and way shorter and, has tight curls (looks like), at the bottom...A  whole different wig!!!!... Anyway...I was waiting for 19 days, and finally , my gorgeous wig arrived! I can&#x27;t even tell you how beautiful, and realistic it is! It looks so much like my hair, about 8 years ago!! SO very long, and soft, and nice ,loose waves, that don&#x27;t look fake , like some do.. Also, it is sorta matte, and not so shiny* It does have a nice natural shine.. but , it .doesnt look like fake doll hair.!.When I have it on, it&#x27;s so comfortable,  too,and I completely forget I&#x27;m wearing a wig, at all!! The cap is roomy,but not too big.. and stays on very well. The only thing that i was a little disappointed, was that it wasn&#x27;t the color ,shown in the picture,which looks like a light brown ,to me..  It&#x27;s actually a light red auburn color.. Pretty much a very lovely , light red color.. but realistic red..Like a peachy. color.. Ohhhh ,I LOVE it!! Even though I still want to get a light brown wig ,just like it.!!... I would definitely recommend buying this wig, from X and Y  Angel.It may cost a few dollars more ,than some of the other sellers.. But,it is totally worth it!! I paid $20.00 including shipping, which was $5.00....</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d really, really, really hoped to find one that was more... well, matte. Less glossy. The curles are realistic because its a bit tangly and real and less glossy, but the top is flat and and smooth and it looks really plasticy. Good for occasions where people expect you to be wearing a wig that will look kinda glossy and plasticy.</li>
            <li> Really soft, looks just like the picture! Looks very healthy and natural, I will add a picture to show the color better.</li>
            <li> This was a great wig especially for the price! It&#x27;s so soft, and easy to take care of. I got LOTS of compliments on it. A really great fun everyday wig. The color is more of a red than I expected but the different tones in it make it look a lot more realistic. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> This Wig took about 2 Weeks to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Package I was unsure of the condition of the wig.&lt;br /&gt;I took it our of the package and it wasn&#x27;t wavy AT ALL! It&#x27;s pin straight!&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are also very ugly, I had to cut them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scalp is see through.&lt;br /&gt;The wig barley fits on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the poor qualities:&lt;br /&gt;The color is the same as in the picture&lt;br /&gt;The wig is the same length as in the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
            <li> Was very surprised of the quality of your wig.  For that price I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as beautiful as it is.  The only thing I needed to change was trimming the end in the back.  They were alittle uneven, but I love it.  I have already ordered two more styles and I can&#x27;t wait till they arrive.  I will never go back to the shops in town when I can order the same if not better from you.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came in. I had been so excited when I ordered it. OH god when it came in I ripped the package open to have of one the BEST wigs I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve owned some pretty expensive nice wigs before. But this one beats those out. It&#x27;s so soft! I have short hair, and I wore it to school, and people thought it was my actual hair! [Silly, right?] It&#x27;s a little thinner than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any. It looks perfect with woodland creature makeup~</li>
            <li> This wig is a lot of fun and it looks great on.  The color seems a little too orangie red, but I just love it.</li>
            <li> I got this wig WAY before the expected delivery date, which is awesome! And I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very realistic and would make a great day-wear wig, just out and about running errands or whatnot. The bangs were really long and needed to be trimmed (but that&#x27;s how it is with pretty much every wig) and it is a bit on the shiny side, especially up near the roots and the crown, but that&#x27;s nothing a little baby/talcum powder can&#x27;t fix! The only negative thing I have to say is there is one thin spot on the back wear there&#x27;s just not that much hair. But it is VERY fluffy and insanely full! I simply added some tracks of weaving hair to the cap to fill in the thin spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would actually say it&#x27;s fuller and fluffier than the picture. Especially after you brush it (which I recommend doing, as long as you have a wig brush). It feels very real, soft but not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from X&amp;Y ANGEL again! :D</li>
            <li> While the pic is cute, it fits weird. I like the color of the hair but the bangs are too long. It definitely looks like a wig, not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice for the price. The hair is soft and manageable. I have no complaints. I receive many compliments when I wear this out in public. Great buy.</li>
