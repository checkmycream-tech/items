            <li>I can see the nice and smooth texture of the skin after using this product, now I want to ask if anyone knows if I could use this product around my eye area???</li>
            <li>so i love the sample size.</li>

            <li>My skin is better now than when I was 30.</li>

            <li>Still using so I&#x27;ll see when I&#x27;m done if I like my skin any better...</li>
            <li>I love this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>This is a cheaper way to go, and I love the easy travel containers.</li>
            <li>easy to carry when you travel, easy to use, makes my skin feel and look more youthful.</li>
            <li>More accurately, I don&#x27;t see any difference after a year of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for frequent travelers.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li>these are fantastic to travel with and helpful too...........</li>
            <li>another seller to make sure you get a fresh product you can use.</li>
            <li>This serums fabulous ...</li>
            <li>I keep it in a drawer away from all light.</li>
            <li>like to buy the travel sized packs not just because they&#x27;re cheaper than getting a full sized bottle, or because you can easily pack and travel with this serum</li>
            <li>Real rip off !!!</li>
            <li>The product I received does not look like anything like the original.</li>
            <li>and I can assure you I have a drawer full of high-end products that didn&#x27;t work in spite of their claims to improve the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>1 dropper full at bedtime is all you need.</li>
            <li>It protects your skin completely and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone with any skin issue-but would suggest using the full sized bottle instead of the travel sizes and keeping it in the fridge.   </li>
            <li>The seller delivered the product quickly.</li>
            <li>Just expect to be asked it you are pregnant over and over because of the glow it provides.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and was it was good to see a package like this to take on vacation for sure</li>
            <li>It also always arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am coming back for more!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy this product so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this package now for 2 months and don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s genuine.  </li>
            <li>Handy size for daily use and travel.  </li>
            <li>Exposure to light, air, and skin oils will gradual decrease the antioxidant power of the serum, which is the whole reason for using this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying/believing that the aging process isn&#x27;t inevitable, this is just a little insurance policy in an effort to stay looking your best.</li>
            <li>CE Ferulic hydrates my skin, protects it from harmful free radicals and overall makes my skin look and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>The original has a light yellow tint to it.</li>
            <li>What I bought is very clear and the original color is orange.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who want results !!</li>
            <li>When I opened the first bottle, the product was &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that this on yielded the most desirable results It actually feels like its working once applied.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought from this merchant.</li>
            <li>my senior and most people think she is younger than I.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend adding this to your repoire!!</li>
            <li>The C serums are my favorite, especially this one because I have normal/dry skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants to see quick results.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford the Dermo&#x27;s cost, so I shopped on-line, and purchased the Travel Pack from another seller, and am certain it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Just bought these little bottles, to try this product better to start with the smaller size, well I just used it today and it feels so good, especially after exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Oh, the very thought of spilling a jar always scared me.  </li>
            <li>I know the difference between the real one and the faked ones..</li>
            <li>I have tried using the imitations for a lower price-and they never seem to work as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li>I keep the unopened ones in the fridge until ready for use</li>
            <li>The samples were not old and were full and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this product and order it regularly from different vendors.</li>
            <li>I prefer the smaller bottles because they are travel friendly and you&#x27;re not dishing out so much cash for a large container.  </li>
            <li>Have been to Europe and all over the US with these products as well as Mexico and Canada and all the Islands and many foreign countries ...........</li>
            <li>You are going to have a new skin!</li>
            <li>Since using Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, my skin has become more even, I break out less and my acne scars and brown spots have faded.</li>
            <li>Item arrived before my 2-day shipment, quality was there (no color) and I love paying a fraction of the price I typically pay for the 1oz bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve had success with that really reduces and prevents breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This work better than something away more expensive, recommend by doctor and it work well.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed the travel pack does not seem to be as potent as the regular bottles even thought they claim to have the same formula.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and helps overall skin improvement</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I do not keep this product in the fridge and it seems to work just fine storing at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of similar products since first trying the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li>Being able to take 1 small vial at a time is convenient</li>
            <li>and you can pour the rest of it into your old bottle!</li>
            <li>I am a ginger and have to work hard to keep my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li>These ones are almost clear in color.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be a brownish color and was clear</li>
            <li>I feel this product was old, since it wasn&#x27;t the clear color it should have been.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the product is old--it is marked \\&quot;samples\\&quot; though it is marketed as \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li>I wish I could afford to buy it for real, in the big bottle, instead of samples.</li>
            <li>Of course I want to see fast results but like anything else, it&#x27;s a process and only time will tell.</li>
            <li>and I get complements on my skin frequently.</li>
            <li>The only product in the world that really works.</li>
            <li>When you apply the original ones they sting a little, these ones not at all.</li>
            <li>I have major sun damage.</li>
            <li>Major skin repair results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals for the last 15yrs and although I love Phloretin; you can always keep a little CE Ferulic for days when you have dry skin or after chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>so far no big difference for me.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Although CE Ferulic has a slightly peculiar scent, it really does the job.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended for those who want results !!</li>
            <li> When I opened the first bottle, the product was &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that this on yielded the most desirable results It actually feels like its working once applied.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought from this merchant.</li>
            <li> my senior and most people think she is younger than I.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend adding this to your repoire!!</li>
            <li> The C serums are my favorite, especially this one because I have normal/dry skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who wants to see quick results.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the Dermo&#x27;s cost, so I shopped on-line, and purchased the Travel Pack from another seller, and am certain it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Just bought these little bottles, to try this product better to start with the smaller size, well I just used it today and it feels so good, especially after exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Oh, the very thought of spilling a jar always scared me.  </li>
            <li> I know the difference between the real one and the faked ones..</li>
            <li> I have tried using the imitations for a lower price-and they never seem to work as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I keep the unopened ones in the fridge until ready for use</li>
            <li> The samples were not old and were full and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product and order it regularly from different vendors.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smaller bottles because they are travel friendly and you&#x27;re not dishing out so much cash for a large container.  </li>
            <li> Have been to Europe and all over the US with these products as well as Mexico and Canada and all the Islands and many foreign countries ...........</li>
            <li> You are going to have a new skin!</li>
            <li> Since using Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, my skin has become more even, I break out less and my acne scars and brown spots have faded.</li>
            <li> Item arrived before my 2-day shipment, quality was there (no color) and I love paying a fraction of the price I typically pay for the 1oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve had success with that really reduces and prevents breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This work better than something away more expensive, recommend by doctor and it work well.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed the travel pack does not seem to be as potent as the regular bottles even thought they claim to have the same formula.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and helps overall skin improvement</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I do not keep this product in the fridge and it seems to work just fine storing at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of similar products since first trying the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> Being able to take 1 small vial at a time is convenient</li>
            <li> and you can pour the rest of it into your old bottle!</li>
            <li> I am a ginger and have to work hard to keep my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li> These ones are almost clear in color.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be a brownish color and was clear</li>
            <li> I feel this product was old, since it wasn&#x27;t the clear color it should have been.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the product is old--it is marked \\&quot;samples\\&quot; though it is marketed as \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford to buy it for real, in the big bottle, instead of samples.</li>
            <li> Of course I want to see fast results but like anything else, it&#x27;s a process and only time will tell.</li>
            <li> and I get complements on my skin frequently.</li>
            <li> The only product in the world that really works.</li>
            <li> When you apply the original ones they sting a little, these ones not at all.</li>
            <li> I have major sun damage.</li>
            <li> Major skin repair results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals for the last 15yrs and although I love Phloretin; you can always keep a little CE Ferulic for days when you have dry skin or after chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> so far no big difference for me.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Although CE Ferulic has a slightly peculiar scent, it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product previously from my dermatologist who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> This product stays fresher in the small vials and if you do have an accident, it is not like losing a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> but my sensitive skin letme down</li>
            <li> it could easily break and that&#x27;s an expensive loss.</li>
            <li> Then continued to open the other 5, and they were the same.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear with little effort on my part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for so long that believe me</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty much a necessity, but because the small individual bottles mean that you&#x27;re only opening up a small portion of the product at a time.</li>
            <li> I had one bottle left of the previous order, and I compared the color, texture, odor and feel when applied to my face, and it&#x27;s not giving me the same results.</li>
            <li> so I have no choice other than to buy the smaller bottles and keep them in the fridge to preserve their potency.   </li>
            <li> It is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t yellow or degrade like larger bottles.</li>
            <li> use it under retinol 1.0 and let it dry and then apply the retinol</li>
            <li> Large bottle of this product in a glass container &amp; not good for travel bc</li>
            <li> slightly pigmented-pale, oily, 20-something, acne prone, few wrinkles, sensitive</li>
            <li> Product arrived when expected and in condition expected.  </li>
            <li> so i was allowed to return this minus a restocking fee which i thought wasnice of this company</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife a few years back and spent twice the money on it.</li>
            <li> They calmed my fears and I began using this every other night.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, or sometimes every other day in problem areas.  </li>
            <li> Just bought a second round this week!</li>
            <li> They serum is different from the usual.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of CE Ferulic but none work like Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> This product does take a little getting used to, and I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference until I stopped using this product for a few months and then resumed use.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry skin in the winter and boosts sun protection year round.   </li>
            <li> Totally expensive, but you really get the results.</li>
            <li> I had a slight line between my brows and after using this there is no sign of it.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient for introducing you to a new product that is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I would give 0 stars if I could, but they only let me write a review if I put at least one start!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are lessened as are the uneven blotches on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and can see very little difference.  </li>
            <li> Small bottles decrease possibility of oxidation, and I can take them with me traveling.  </li>
            <li> No more oil feeling skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in these bottles...  </li>
            <li> This is expensive and never liked traveling with the larger sigle bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> I tried to return it, they said it was too late.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive and I expected a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful and does turn brown with the light.  </li>
            <li> The friend was visiting with us in the US and it was much less expensive in this country.</li>
            <li> I received my Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Travel Pack approximately two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind losing or breaking one small bottle, but a big $160 bottle would be devastating.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I travel about 65% of the time for my job-</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used this for a few years now and I really like the condition of my skin.  I have read that this is very good for your skin and asked my dermatologist about it which she said this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I love being able to purchase the sample size Skinceutical CE Ferulic.  The product came very quickly; I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife a few years back and spent twice the money on it. It was cumbersome to travel with a 2 oz bottle, so I thought I would try the travel size. She loves the product and travels everywhere with it. The seller delivered the product quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel this product was old, since it wasn&#x27;t the clear color it should have been.  However, I kept it anyway just because of the hassle of doing a return.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific bargain. I was concerned when I saw no expiration date on the box, so I contacted the company. They calmed my fears and I began using this every other night. The results are amazing. My wrinkles are lessened as are the uneven blotches on my face. The smell dissipates rapidly and is no big deal IMHO. The fact that I can actually see the amount of improvement that I have achieved has convinced me that this works wonders. Probably the best I&#x27;ve used and I can assure you I have a drawer full of high-end products that didn&#x27;t work in spite of their claims to improve the condition of my skin. Highly recommended for those who want results !!</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product so much.  Small bottles decrease possibility of oxidation, and I can take them with me traveling.  Don&#x27;t mind losing or breaking one small bottle, but a big $160 bottle would be devastating.</li>
            <li> This was perfect whoever the supplier was on this is a good one. The samples were not old and were full and fresh. Very happy with this purchase. CE is the best.</li>
            <li> Product arrived when expected and in condition expected.  This type of package of the product is perfect for travel purposes</li>
            <li> Although CE Ferulic has a slightly peculiar scent, it really does the job. I have noticed that my skin looks fresher and clearer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now since it was introduced to me at a day spa.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve had success with that really reduces and prevents breakouts.  I use it once a day, or sometimes every other day in problem areas.  I prefer the smaller bottles because they are travel friendly and you&#x27;re not dishing out so much cash for a large container.  The 6 bottle sampler has lasted me well over a year and I am coming back for more!  Excellent product!  Unlike other reviewers, I do not keep this product in the fridge and it seems to work just fine storing at room temperature. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years now. It keeps my skin clear with little effort on my part. Just put it sparingly on your face in the morning and forget it.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to using this serum, but there is no way. It smells so bad. Perhaps the product is old--it is marked \\&quot;samples\\&quot; though it is marketed as \\&quot;travel size.\\&quot;  Do yourself a favor and buy another product--</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother. Best deal around on the product that came highly reccomended by her dermotologist. Just bought a second round this week!</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  I am a ginger and have to work hard to keep my skin healthy.  I can go without make up with this product.</li>
            <li> CE Ferulic is a great product.  This is expensive and never liked traveling with the larger sigle bottle.  Oh, the very thought of spilling a jar always scared me.  This product stays fresher in the small vials and if you do have an accident, it is not like losing a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist had given me a sample of the CE Ferulic which I was extremely impressed with the results on my skin after 2 weeks. I couldn&#x27;t afford the Dermo&#x27;s cost, so I shopped on-line, and purchased the Travel Pack from another seller, and am certain it was the real deal.  I&#x27;ve been using this package now for 2 months and don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s genuine.  When I opened the first bottle, the product was &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;.  Then continued to open the other 5, and they were the same.  I had one bottle left of the previous order, and I compared the color, texture, odor and feel when applied to my face, and it&#x27;s not giving me the same results.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of similar products since first trying the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. and I feel that this on yielded the most desirable results It actually feels like its working once applied. It gave my skin a very nice glow.</li>
            <li> I received my Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Travel Pack approximately two weeks ago.  I needed something that I could carry with me. For maintain beautiful, glowing skin, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> More accurately, I don&#x27;t see any difference after a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m eliminating it from my skin routine since my pores have become clogged and skin congested. I&#x27;m trying a gel from Body Time for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revisit this sight in a month to update my review.</li>
            <li> The product I received does not look like anything like the original. What I bought is very clear and the original color is orange. The smell is very different and the packaging says that the sale is prohibited. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  my skin glows.  people take 10 years off my age.  when people ask what my skicare regimen is, this is it.  1 dropper full at bedtime is all you need.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go anywhere without my Skinceutical products and am so thankful for their travel size products. Have been to Europe and all over the US with these products as well as Mexico and Canada and all the Islands and many foreign countries ...........these are fantastic to travel with and helpful too...........I love them.  This is the best product I ever put on my face!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals for the last 15yrs and although I love Phloretin; you can always keep a little CE Ferulic for days when you have dry skin or after chemical peels.  It protects your skin completely and effectively.  I had a slight line between my brows and after using this there is no sign of it.  I&#x27;m not saying/believing that the aging process isn&#x27;t inevitable, this is just a little insurance policy in an effort to stay looking your best.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look better I would recommend this product. 9 more words are required so here they are</li>
            <li> but my sensitive skin letme down so i was allowed to return this minus a restocking fee which i thought wasnice of this company</li>
            <li> I use it for three years. I like it a  lot</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using Skinceutical CE Ferulic for many years. This is the first time I bought from this merchant. I bought 10 travel packs with 6 mini vials in each box because they were selling for a really good price. However when I got them, I found out why they were cheaper. They serum is different from the usual. The original has a light yellow tint to it. These ones are almost clear in color. When you apply the original ones they sting a little, these ones not at all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for so long that believe me I know the difference between the real one and the faked ones.. Don&#x27;t ever buy from this merchant. I suspect that they mixed with something else to. I have learned my lesson the hard way. Don&#x27;t trust this merchant.Will never buy from this merchant again. I would give 0 stars if I could, but they only let me write a review if I put at least one start! Real rip off !!!</li>
            <li> This protects your skin from sun damage, and it&#x27;s good to use after cleansing, under your moisturizer/sunscreen.  It gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Love the size for traveling.  Great idea!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product, however, when I ordered from Shop2Beauty, they sent me a rancid, brown oil that smells like bacon.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it, they said it was too late. I would not order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Find another seller to make sure you get a fresh product you can use.</li>
            <li> Of course an amazing product, have to use it to believe it! I am on third order!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I wish I could afford to buy it for real, in the big bottle, instead of samples.</li>
            <li> Just a newbee at this product. I have major sun damage. I have seen gradual progress in the lightening of sun spots and the smoothness of my sking.Of course I want to see fast results but like anything else, it&#x27;s a process and only time will tell. I love the travel pack! It is convenient for introducing you to a new product that is so expensive. For now, I will continue to purchase tthe travel size tubes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction and product.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I get complements on my skin frequently.</li>
            <li> This serums fabulous ...My skin looks freshers, cleaners  and  more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone over the age of 21.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years, she is eight years my senior and most people think she is younger than I. Maybe I should try it!!</li>
            <li> This work better than something away more expensive, recommend by doctor and it work well. No more oil feeling skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great for frequent travelers. Large bottle of this product in a glass container &amp; not good for travel bc it could easily break and that&#x27;s an expensive loss. Being able to take 1 small vial at a time is convenient</li>
            <li> This product was ordered for a Brazilian friend who uses the product in Brazil.  The friend was visiting with us in the US and it was much less expensive in this country.</li>
            <li> CE Ferulic is an integral part of my skin care regimen that I cannot go without. I have tried other brands of CE Ferulic but none work like Skinceuticals. CE Ferulic hydrates my skin, protects it from harmful free radicals and overall makes my skin look and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product but it is very expensive.  This is a cheaper way to go, and I love the easy travel containers.</li>
            <li> This seller says this is CE Ferulic, but I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic for years and know the smell, look, and feel, and this is not it.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in these bottles...  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I have used and reviewed skinceuticals CE Ferulic for years now. I have tried using the imitations for a lower price-and they never seem to work as well as the real thing. However, I have noticed the travel pack does not seem to be as potent as the regular bottles even thought they claim to have the same formula. Unfortunately I travel about 65% of the time for my job-so I have no choice other than to buy the smaller bottles and keep them in the fridge to preserve their potency.   Since using Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, my skin has become more even, I break out less and my acne scars and brown spots have faded. My wrinkles that were beginning to form ceased and some have disappeared.This product does take a little getting used to, and I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference until I stopped using this product for a few months and then resumed use. Four years later- I never go a day without it. It helps with dry skin in the winter and boosts sun protection year round.   I recommend this to everyone with any skin issue-but would suggest using the full sized bottle instead of the travel sizes and keeping it in the fridge.   skin type: slightly pigmented-pale, oily, 20-something, acne prone, few wrinkles, sensitive</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive and I expected a difference in my skin.  I have used it for a month and can see very little difference.  It smells awful and does turn brown with the light.  I keep it in a drawer away from all light.</li>
            <li> Just bought these little bottles, to try this product better to start with the smaller size, well I just used it today and it feels so good, especially after exfoliating my skin. I can see the nice and smooth texture of the skin after using this product, now I want to ask if anyone knows if I could use this product around my eye area??? because there&#x27;s products made for the entire face, meanwhile there&#x27;s another ones they are not recommended for that fragile area, could someone answer that question for me? Thanks!</li>
            <li> The only product in the world that really works. You are going to have a new skin! I strongly recommend CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> Totally expensive, but you really get the results. I travel a ton so i love the sample size. Don&#x27;t expect it to smell pretty. Just expect to be asked it you are pregnant over and over because of the glow it provides. Use it in the morning only.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product previously from my dermatologist who highly recommended it. I appreciate having the convenient travel size.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a glow when used daily in the evening&lt;br /&gt;I use it under retinol 1.0 and let it dry and then apply the retinol</li>
            <li> One of the best CE Ferulic Travel Packs ever.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself doesn&#x27;t smell too good - but it&lt;br /&gt;is excellent for your skin.</li>
            <li> Best skin protection that I&#x27;ve ever had! I highly recommend adding this to your repoire!! This is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I love my skin after using this!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and was it was good to see a package like this to take on vacation for sure</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel!!  The size works well when trying to minimize a carry on bag of skincare products. I will look to find them in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and a extremely pleased with my purchase of the travel pack. Item arrived before my 2-day shipment, quality was there (no color) and I love paying a fraction of the price I typically pay for the 1oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Major skin repair results.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants to see quick results.  My skin  looked younger and smoother in one week when I started using.  I have been using this serum for years and would not be without it.  It is worth every penny and helps overall skin improvement</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! easy to carry when you travel, easy to use, makes my skin feel and look more youthful.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals makes amazing, effective products. There&#x27;s no way to doubt it. The C serums are my favorite, especially this one because I have normal/dry skin. If you&#x27;re someone who has normal/oily then you might want to try the phloretin CF.&lt;br /&gt;I like to buy the travel sized packs not just because they&#x27;re cheaper than getting a full sized bottle, or because you can easily pack and travel with this serum that&#x27;s pretty much a necessity, but because the small individual bottles mean that you&#x27;re only opening up a small portion of the product at a time. This means that the bulk of the product you&#x27;re not using is being spared from potential oxidation. Exposure to light, air, and skin oils will gradual decrease the antioxidant power of the serum, which is the whole reason for using this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I can visible tell that this serum works. I have freckles and have had them all my life. However, when I look at pictures of myself I can tell during which summers I was using this product, and which I was not or wasn&#x27;t as strict with it. This serum will help to fade sunspots and freckles, reduce redness caused by sun damage, and it will make your sunscreen more effective at keeping uva and uvb rays from causing more harm to your skin. Use this product every morning underneath your sunscreen, which should be 30 or more.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this size for years and I absolutely love this product.  I have had no issue with the quality of the product (although I buy from different vendors).  It also always arrives quickly. This is a great seller.  I really liked how it was packaged.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell too pretty but it works great.  I love it! My skin looks great.  Really good product.</li>
            <li> I had been using this stuff recommended by a doctor. I heard about a product that was suposedly the same but cheaper. I didn&#x27;t work the same way so I quit using the stuff all tgether. My forehead then broke out so I ordered more. Now I am convinced it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> the catch is you can&#x27;t miss a day. My nose has been sunburned so many times and I think that this has helped. My skin looks and feels softer and the redness is reduced. The sample size is perfect. It is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t yellow or degrade like larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Every drop is a youthful adventure. My skin is better now than when I was 30. Buy the product now and see the results before June.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product and order it regularly from different vendors. The key here is freshness...I haven&#x27;t opened each vial but when I do I always check for color. The clearer, the better. I keep the unopened ones in the fridge until ready for use</li>
            <li> This is a great way to buy this product.  Best of both worlds--small for travel and you can pour the rest of it into your old bottle!</li>
            <li> start each day with this-really great</li>
            <li> Still using so I&#x27;ll see when I&#x27;m done if I like my skin any better...so far no big difference for me.</li>
            <li> The CE Ferulic serum was diluted.  It is supposed to be a brownish color and was clear so I believe it had been diluted.  I love this&lt;br /&gt;product but now realized I should buy it from a spa.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dermatologist.  Delivered promptly.  Handy size for daily use and travel.  I have shared one bottle with my daughter to see how it works for her.</li>
