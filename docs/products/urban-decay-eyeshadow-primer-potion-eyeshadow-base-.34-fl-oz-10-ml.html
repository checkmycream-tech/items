            <li>Great product and I will keep buying it</li>
            <li>and she said it was a great product.</li>
            <li>She looked great for some photos we took.</li>
            <li>If you want to take the time to dab the primer onto an eyeshadow brush and then apply it works great.</li>

            <li>Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!!</li>
            <li>Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!!</li>
            <li>Faced primer is also very popular, but I prefer this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tilted applicator comes in very handy for those of us that do not want to contort our hands and arms just to apply eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Did I mention it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love eye make-up, and this product is a great find!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it has changed my life when it comes to make-up!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most perfect product in the world....</li>
            <li>saying that it is an amazing product and that it does not fade, and with my oily skin I thought it would be perfect, but its not as amazing as its all cracked up to be.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and well worth the money :D</li>
            <li>makes shadows, liners, and mascara stay bright and un-smudged all day.</li>
            <li>the gold color was so pigmented it shown brightly through any eyeshadow</li>
            <li>A good buy</li>
            <li>For example, I walk 3 miles to and from work every day in a fairly humid climate, and when I take my eye makeup off at night, it still looks like I JUST put it on.</li>
            <li>I used it under my makeup for a wedding, and my eye makeup looked as good at 1am as it did at 1pm.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day your eye shadow will look almost as good as when you put it on that morning.  </li>
            <li>It is a good primer</li>
            <li>Keeps it all looking good through activity, even heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>the primer is so good.</li>
            <li>Its good.  </li>
            <li>than all that, it&#x27;s a good product, just a bit pricey for a girl like me.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to work this good through out the summer months.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I had a sample of this from sephora and I loved it then.</li>
            <li>, I was very pleased and service was good from this company.</li>
            <li>and I am always very happy with how true the color of the shadow turns out over this product.</li>
            <li>If money is not a problem, then it&#x27;s a great deal :)</li>
            <li>Based on many youtube beauty blog&#x27;s great review, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it works great, I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>It helps to make the eye shadow stick out more and keeps it in place until you take it off!</li>
            <li>I love EVERYTHING about this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>

            <li>I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li>This primer is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is seriously amazing now after I tried it</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutley amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to put under the lower lashes to prevent eyeliner from creasing as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that effective, the primer.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best though.</li>
            <li>Also perfect for ladies who go out clubbing the whole night too.     </li>
            <li>My daughter bought it and liked it</li>
            <li>so I got some and liked it.</li>
            <li>I tried this at a friends house and could not wait to order my own.</li>
            <li>My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way.</li>
            <li>My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>First, the product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to blend the eyeshadow together, so if your looking for a great primer for your eyeshadow, Oily skin or not, you need to try it, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!)</li>
            <li>They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!)</li>
            <li>As a Makeup Artist I knew this was going to be an amazing product already, as I have always loved Urban Decay - but the price from this seller was the best part!</li>
            <li>This works so good that my eyeshadows even show kinda true colors that they have never shown before applying this!</li>
            <li>I am now able to use even cheap eyeshadow with great results.</li>
            <li>Product went on very easy...</li>
            <li>Love it, love it!</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, and it genuinely does do a good job as a primer.</li>
            <li>I love love love it and would reccommend it to anyone who inquires about a good eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault, thinking 10ml/.34oz would be more</li>
            <li>I have many of their eye kits, and always get a primer potion deluxe sample with the kit.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best primer I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>my make up stays on  looks as fresh  just a great products</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>and of course higher end ones work great as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had heard about it through a friend and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Has to be put on very light...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, so having this product in your purse won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>You can use a VERY light hand on the fade-ier sections, or just a lighter color (which I feel works better.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great, if you have very fair skin, for covering up little vein lines or spots on your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>more clarity&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love using this product whenever i use eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Of course, it took a bit of practice for the eyeshadow, but after some time, I was able to figure that out too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE that also.</li>
            <li>: Put a layer of mascara on your top lashes before you apply the shawdow, if any shadow falls, it falls on your lashes, not your face.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It might have been better if they just put it in a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>I love makeup, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li>I love this primer.  </li>
            <li>If you have cheap eyeshadows that doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin well, use this!</li>
            <li>my video, I&#x27;ll tell you why I love the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, what it does for me and even show you the awesome applicator to apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this product exists.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this one blends in with most skin tones</li>
            <li>I love this primer and had to go to the hospital and had it on and it lasted for two days till my husband brought my makeup remover to me</li>
            <li>I use them interchangeably and have not found that one is better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li>Better than what I was using for my lids-- a face primer by Veil.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>You also have to depot it after some time to get all the product out because, although the shape is cute, the wand won&#x27;t reach it all.</li>
            <li>I love the way it sets my liner and shadow, PLUS</li>
            <li>Splurg on your primer, go cheep on eyeshadow... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>Still, though, for the price, you&#x27;d like to be able to get the most mileage from the product.</li>
            <li>After using it once, I have rekindled my love of eye makeup.</li>
            <li>There are many videos on YouTube on how to get most of the product out of the package.</li>
            <li>but then I decided to try it once more</li>
            <li>but this time I used a lot more, and it work</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my eye shadow stay in place, even in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this primer, but one thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I do love there powder foundation in fantasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a brush that comes off (like a lipgloss), and if the top breaks, it just dries up inside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just prefer to get more bang for my buck with Too Faced&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li>Looked kind of cheap to me</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, been using for years</li>
            <li>I got this primer relatively fast in great packaging.</li>
            <li>You will absolutely love this potion.</li>
            <li>Cheap, cheap pots of glitter eyeshadow for 4 bucks with this primer, and it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>wish I could figure out why so many people love this, but . . .</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this eye primer.  </li>
            <li>Urban Decay is the best I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>However, if it isn&#x27;t authentic, I don&#x27;t know how safe it is on my eye lids.</li>
            <li>this stops the watering, love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eyeshadow primers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Love the wand applicator.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay is a wonderful brand.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves Urban Decay eyeshadow and primer and finds that this works the best.  </li>
            <li>i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li>so I tried to heat it in the microwave to get the liquid flowing better.  </li>
            <li>I see now that it is not any better than the cheaper Elf product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using foundation powder under my shadow works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>But I guess that is the price you pay for the cute bottle.  </li>
            <li>this primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I am so glad now that I didn&#x27;t listen to her.  </li>
            <li>but it does work and it makes you eye makeup look better than before.</li>
            <li>This is suppose to be the top notch primer on the make up</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and held my eyeshadow all day!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product ♡♡</li>
            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looks much better @</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>You will love this product.</li>
            <li>Right now I am 7 hours into my day and my golds are just as bright and un-oily as at 7am this morning.</li>
            <li>I have been using this primer for about 8-9 months now and so far it has been a good one!</li>
            <li>I got a great deal on a kit, but mainly bought it to try this out.</li>
            <li>I loved this primer for the first year I used it.</li>
            <li>I loved it from first use.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good primer.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a good thing for me, but be aware of that</li>
            <li>It seems to keep my eye make-up in perfect condition all day long.</li>
            <li>This primer is one of the best for shadow to stay put all day long.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>the primer was brand new as stated and of great quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really very cool</li>
            <li>It was the best $18 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li>This was great eye primer my shadow last most of the day and no crease in my eye lids :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really looking for a good eye primer</li>
            <li>I bought this product on the advice of a friend and after the first time using it, I am officially in love!  </li>
            <li>i dont have any other words but perfect.</li>
            <li>Let me be honest, about 6 years ago, I first tried this product, and I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why people loved it so much.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily with the applicator and my eye shadow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, isn&#x27;t sticky, and gives the eye shadow</li>
            <li>fantastic, quick and great handling thanks</li>
            <li>Good make-up is wasted without a great primer, which is this.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>eye\\&quot; look, the colors blend easily and stay blended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>The primer dries clear and is really good for keeping make-up on if you&#x27;re going to be out of the house for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a great product and definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I can swipe both lids without re-dunking the applicator and that works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, easy to apply and must have for all ladies out there.</li>
            <li>The price might seem a bit steep for this little bottle but trust me, it&#x27;s the best investment.  </li>
            <li>This primer makes a huge difference in the length of time</li>
            <li>It went on so smooth and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>The primer goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how it really pulls out the pigment of the shadow.  </li>
            <li>This primer works great for my eyeshadow, especially the mineral eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the BOMB and honestly one of the best primers out there, but UDPP has to DUMBEST packaging possible - I plan to open it up and depot it.</li>
            <li>Just go light...</li>
            <li>The results will be smooth, streak-free,and crease free.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my eyes and it went on so smoothly</li>
            <li>It goes on globby and looks globby even if you try to smooth it out with your finger.  </li>
            <li>My eye shadow lasts all day with just a light coat of this in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product helps eye shadow glide on smoothly and stay on without creasing.  </li>
            <li>My eyeshadow is cheap stuff from the beauty supply.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t cheap for what it is.</li>
            <li>Fantastic primer.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control.</li>
            <li>Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works great and last.</li>
            <li>--my eye make up still looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m not using this for bright, super chic colors, I&#x27;ve used it with a pretty wide spectrum of looks and it&#x27;s been consistently great.</li>
            <li>I never used to use eyeshadow primer &amp; now I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s been my whole life !!!</li>
            <li>I know it is a very popular product, and I have to say that it definitely lives up to the hype!  </li>
            <li>The original UD eyeshadow primer potion is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you enough good things about this product - it&#x27;s an absolute must-have for women (and some adventurous men!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing $3 Hot Topic eyeshadows over it for testing right now and they look spectacular]</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when Sin came out.</li>
            <li>I am soooo excited about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>by the end of the day, my eyeshadow still looked fresh!</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money!</li>
            <li>so worth the money!</li>
            <li>My eyes look great, no creases, and make up lasts all night long.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow primer makes your eyeshadow look just as rich on your eyes as it is on the palette, and it makes it stay on ALL day.</li>
            <li>With the original product my eye shadow did not budge at all.</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a sample with a palette I bought.</li>
            <li>I love this product soooo much!</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>UD seems to be pretty top notch.</li>
            <li>Definitely try this out if you find a price you&#x27;re satisfied with!:)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>However, just like how the application took a bit of practice, trying to keep the product clean took a bit of practice as well.     </li>
            <li>It also makes the shadow go on smoothly and more intensely.</li>
            <li>But the unexpected benefit and the thing I love the most is that it prevents my eyeliner from smudging.</li>
            <li>It is very nice, and i think i will stick to it for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eye primer on the market!</li>
            <li>Purchased this as a gift for someone special.</li>
            <li>PLUS, it makes eyeshadow so much more vibrant!</li>
            <li>The colors of all my shadows are more true and intense</li>
            <li>amazing, completely does everything it says and</li>
            <li>If I pay as much as I&#x27;m willing to pay from such a store, I expect something great.</li>
            <li>Plus the packaging is way cute and the bottle it comes in seems very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full color.</li>
            <li>I do make up as a hobby for wedding, senior pictures, and sweet 16&#x27;s/15&#x27;s birthdays</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and most products do not work.</li>
            <li>I can get through my entire work day and my eye makeup still looks good.</li>
            <li>Primer will keep a thick layer of shadow in perfect place, never looses shimmer.</li>
            <li>I did not want to pay full price at a makeup store.</li>
            <li>This product really does keep your eye shadow from creasing, but you have to make sure you apply is under your foundation/base color.</li>
            <li>In the sweltering heat my lids get really oily and without this magical primer</li>
            <li>I am sure it lasts longer during winter when my oil gland don&#x27;t get activated as much.</li>
            <li>This seems like a really good product to make eye shadow last longer with out creasing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>Given as a present and the receiver said she loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure other reviews have touched up on this, and may be able to offer better insight.</li>
            <li>after using urban decay primer potion (which feel so creamy and smooth and lovely!)</li>
            <li>It also makes the color of eye shadow more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It promotes a more vibrant looking eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>It glides on and dries quickly</li>
            <li>Another example: last night I fell asleep with my makeup still on; when I woke up, my eye makeup was still flawless, even after applying it 24 hours earlier, and sleeping on it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty slick eyelids that would always make even the best eyeshadows just disappear in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>It makes eye shadows more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better hope that you don&#x27;t have any crow&#x27;s feet, because it will only make them look crepe-y and more intensified.</li>
            <li>My eyeliner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help.</li>
            <li>So shipping was extremely quick</li>
            <li>Arrived really quickly</li>
            <li>I love using lots of bright colors, and up until I found Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, I was never able to get eyeshadow colors as bright as it seems like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Is amazing, eyeshadows last all day long, consistency is light and smells good.</li>
            <li>Also makes the eyeshadow color more vibrant and pretty!</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re interested in cheap eyeshadow palettes you should look into Coastal Scents.)</li>
            <li>A year ago we moved to a very hot climate and my eye makeup was disappearing until I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from Sephora and the first time I tried it I was blown away.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this item and I am still very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This is my very first purchase from UD.</li>
            <li>set came in a cute little package and very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li>So, I live in Texas, have oily skin and LOVE powdered eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the half of what I utilized worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times on my eyeshadow and have been asked many times how it stays on for so long.    </li>
            <li>I guess that wasn&#x27;t wise since I do have dry skin.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow stayed on for 2 days if you want long lasting wear from your eyeshadow use this product best I ever used</li>
            <li>Helps eyeshadow to stay on very well, and is easy to work</li>
            <li>i never use eyeshadow without using this primer first!</li>
            <li>Do mascara FIRST!</li>
            <li>Get ready to fend off suitors!!</li>
            <li>Get ready to fend off suitors!!</li>
            <li>It helps the colors show up very vibrant and smooth.</li>
            <li>With a little primer beneath my eye as well as on my lids, it prevents that smearing and my eyeliner looks as great at the end of the day as it does five minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today and I will be wearing makeup more often mainly because of this item.</li>
            <li>But using it with browns, golds, black and other more neutral colors, it works great!</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants their eyeshadow to look great and stay on for a long time, I suggest you buy this!!!</li>
            <li>Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion is amazing.</li>
            <li>I actually found out about this product from a makeup tutorial on Youtube, and primer potion is amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky and you don&#x27;t need to much.</li>
            <li>amazing bonus is that the primer makes my shadow and liner last ALL DAY!  </li>
            <li>I applied my eye shadow and they didnt come out as bright as I expected them to</li>
            <li>really well [even cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I tried this one because it was reasonably priced and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Primer potion is truly an amazing eye primer by Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>Best kept secret in my kaboodle.</li>
            <li>I am indeed a fan, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>more.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money found my life time eye shadow primer</li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup looking fresh and perfect all day long; it looks like I just applied the makeup even at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and blend, and it makes my eyeshadow look vibrant and stay put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I honestly can never go back to doing my makeup without it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Professional Size this time :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li>, i attempted to make this worth for the eye shadow</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It works a lot vetter with Urban Decays own eye make up.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>There are better primers out there, even their other eyeshadow primers do a better job than this watery one.</li>
            <li>It really makes the color of the shadow more vibrant and crease proof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve tried so far and really makes your shadow last most of the day with limited creasing.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I turn right around and buy it again and again.  </li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a tube with the ability to just squeeze out the right amount.</li>
            <li>right in place.</li>
            <li>My makeup can last a full 14+ hours with this :)</li>
            <li>Silky smooth, no creasing, and your vibrant color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about the great reviews for this product--but it works great!  </li>
            <li>This potion keeps my shadow fresh like it was when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone 12+ hours with crease-free lids that looked as fresh as when I first applied my shadow.</li>
            <li>I use the original mainly for my eyeshadows, and I use Sin alone.    </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li>For that reason, I likely won&#x27;t repurchase this brand, but it definitely works great...</li>
            <li>consistency is nice, blends out and dries fast - almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and this helped tremendously with keeping my shadow where it should be.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was great, I definitely like the vintage bottle better then the new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is awesome, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>It also helps you use less of your makeup products, which in the long run, saves you money and keeps you looking great!</li>
            <li>It is sheer and very light...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter what eyeshadow brand you use this with, it will make any eyeshadow go on smoother, blend better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I love urban decay to began with!</li>
            <li>and still have so much more left.</li>
            <li>Only using three small dabs, it was the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a primer that actually worked!  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>When I first stated using the primer</li>
            <li>This is the first eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a thicker primer something along the lines of the Mac Paint Pots at first</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY oily!</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what you need it to</li>
            <li>My first issue is that it goes on oily.</li>
            <li>and this does absolutely everything it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>The top broke off the second week I got it</li>
            <li>Will never go out without priming with this first.</li>
            <li>it looks like it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>This product really does work!</li>
            <li>Maybe if I had an eye makeup remover, it would have been easier, hahaha!</li>
            <li>With this product it looks fresh until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>With this primer, it looks fresh and can be as intense as you want it to all day.  </li>
            <li>I use it everytime and it never fails.</li>
            <li>when I first read reviews for this, I knew about the genie bottle vs. tube styles, and knew this one was going to be the bottle,</li>
            <li>(I knew I wasn&#x27;t ever going to do that, but I was aware that was an option</li>
            <li>My daughter purchased this but, payed way to much at the mall!</li>
            <li>I love your Naked pallettes</li>
            <li>Put this product on first then apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li>If you want to look at the end of your day like you looked in the VERY beginning, buy this!</li>
            <li>Really that&#x27;s all I can say about this product!  </li>
            <li>I just make sure my lid is covered and rub off any extra.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :)</li>
            <li>Love potion #9 is how I feel about Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye primer</li>
            <li>I was suggested by another review to buy this product, and although I was hesitant based on the price, I can absolutely say that it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon helps to find the lowest price, and I&#x27;ve been able to find it for a decent price at my local makeup store.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed, eyeshadow stayed on all day without creasing and stayed just as vibrant as when I applied it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Generally, my eyeliner would smudge, lighten, and smear downward giving a bit of a light &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; throughout the day that I had to be aware of.</li>
            <li>ill order from u more often keep up the good work</li>
            <li>The Urban Decay primer comes in a cute bottle, but I feel like you don&#x27;t get as much product as you do with Too Faced.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product in both the Original (which is a translucent color with a matte finish) as well as the Sin (which is a very pretty neutral color in a shimmery finish).</li>
            <li>Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all</li>
            <li>I can be up and running for 16 hours straight and by the end of the day my eye shadow looks like it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought the tube version, and the first time I used it, the end of the tube burst and much of the product oozed out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty much out of it already.  </li>
            <li>but when i first tried i noticed that its very oily.</li>
            <li>I love having my eyeshadow stay on where I put it all day long</li>
            <li>This product is far superior to Mary Kay, Laura Mercier, and other eyeshadow primers in my experience.     </li>
            <li>but still you get it for free...and even if you want it by itself you can most likely get it for cheaper than how much this person wants....</li>
            <li>This stuff totally works and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, but have never had any type of reaction while using it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item authentic, a lil primer goes a long way or it will crease, brings out the color in eyeshadows n</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s super cute, it ends up leaving quite a bit of product in the bottle, which gets wasted.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent primer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don&#x27;t like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don&#x27;t like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it.</li>
            <li>This really delivers as promised.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and always had a problem keeping my Eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for sharing....</li>
            <li>It helped eye shadow and eye liner stay on the whole day without greasing and smear.</li>
            <li>The two things that I absolutely about this product: 1.</li>
            <li>how light and sheer it feels, and 2.</li>
            <li>For real, not one crease, smudge or flake.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>Now it stays put all day and for much of the evening.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this one with a bright green, yellow and blue shadows (not together though) and they stay on most of the day</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;re ready to apply makeup.    </li>
            <li>This potion doesn&#x27;t really work to prevent creasing with oily lids.</li>
            <li>The product is very pricey</li>
            <li>Also it really does stay on, so</li>
            <li>It makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this stuff keeps my eyeshadow from smearing, creasing, running or flaking.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the primer in \\&quot;sin\\&quot; this time around and do not like it as much.</li>
            <li>I think I paid too much for this for it to be in this condition.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I order this because it was cheap, and I wanted to try Urban Decay products.</li>
            <li>but i do think thats too much for the primer...</li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Girlfit from Makeupalley for the hint</li>
            <li>Helps blend colors smoothly and it came 4 days than it was suppose to overall</li>
            <li>I was really, truly amazed with this product.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really think it worked, so I just decided not to use the product.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I think that says a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I used to like the straight applicator they had, but you could never get all the product out of the container.</li>
            <li>You can use the wand once the tube gets emptier, but a newer tube will have too much product on it to wipe around.</li>
            <li>You can attempt to blend, but the colors won&#x27;t move around too much.</li>
            <li>You can attempt to blend, but the colors won&#x27;t move around too much.</li>
            <li>Really does make your shadow stay brighter for longer.</li>
            <li>I put a tiny smear of the potion on each lid then gently smooth it over my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really argue with all the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>My eye shadow still creases but it takes much longer for it to do so.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with knowing how much to put on or when to put it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone in search of a primer!</li>
            <li>But in my opinion, this product is worth the messy self-education... :)</li>
            <li>I finally tried the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the color more vibrant and it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does with any other primer, even the really cheap ones that come in the eyeshadow trio</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought afew other eye shadow primers and have had difficulty being able to blend, stay blended, or even work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this primer, my eyeshadow stays vibrant and lasts much, much longer.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants their shadow to stay well, not crease and look vibrant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another really great thing - because you need so little, each bottle will last you quite a long time, making the $25 price tag not nearly as painful.</li>
            <li>I am assured that I am getting the true color of my Urban Decay shadow without the under hues of my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The primer tube is a bit larger than a full sized tube of mascara, and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; is a stick with a sponge.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely try to leave the house with a full face done.</li>
            <li>I love it and will never use any other product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every single penny, and if you own expensive eyeshadows and don&#x27;t wear a good primer, then you are totally wasting money.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and keeps my eyeshadow from creasing.</li>
            <li>I can also apply less eyeshadow and get better results than before when I used to apply and apply and apply before I got the color intensity I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just for the older set.  </li>
            <li>so putting on a product that makes me older</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had it last through a humid day and when I got home, my makeup looked exactly as it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>I love Urban Decay -- especially their 24/7 eye pencils.  </li>
            <li>It keeps eyeshadow on and vibrant until I want to take it off at night.</li>
            <li>You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don&#x27;t want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes!</li>
            <li>an extra moisturizer!liner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help.</li>
            <li>You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don&#x27;t want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes!</li>
            <li>I could say \\&quot;bye, bye\\&quot; to a decent eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it normally sells for $18-$20 at most makeup stores which is a little more than I like to spend on a tiny tube of primer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for ALL women.</li>
            <li>My daughter would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A little bit pricey, but I have yet to find one that works better.</li>
            <li>You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it.</li>
            <li>You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it.</li>
            <li>It does make the colors a little more</li>
            <li>Absolutely no creasing of my eyeshadow and eyeshadow in general looks so much more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow Primer Potion to every girl, even if you don&#x27;t have trouble with your eyeshadow creasing, It&#x27;s great for making your eyeshadow last all day or night.</li>
            <li>normally, it&#x27;s all wiped off within 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>i love this product and i use it everyday...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>For the record, this works and prevents my lids from turning into a greasy pit by the end of a normal work day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many eye makeup primers, but this one actually does what it promises-crease-free, smudge-free, all day long until you take your makeup off with remover.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really worth the price, but it definitely make my eye liner go on a lot easier!</li>
            <li>I normally like to use just two colors a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; darker color, and a lighter \\&quot;highligter\\&quot; type of color.</li>
            <li>so I feel like normally my eye make-up melts off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several of these and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and covers well - makes a great base for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I had a super long work day</li>
            <li>I saw they came out with a new tube version though, which I&#x27;m looking forward to trying.  </li>
            <li>here(I live in Texas).</li>
            <li>I do not like this primer searching for a new one.</li>
            <li>Just gotta make sure that you really want the eyeshadow you put on your eyes because if you try to rub it...it&#x27;s hard to get off without using soap and water.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more solid and blend in my skin like my foundation.</li>
            <li>Not now, I apply Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion on first, and my Eyeshadow stays on all day and into the night..</li>
            <li>I used it the first day and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years, and I absolutely LOVE this product.    </li>
            <li>Primer Potion totally fixed that!</li>
            <li>The Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion is the first thing I put on my eyes every day.  </li>
            <li>Eyelids may constitute a small square footage of your epidermis, but they have oil glands, too; just try touching them at the end of the day and you might feel how greasy they can be.</li>
            <li>However, the other colors (Sin, Eden) do NOT work as well as the original.    </li>
            <li>, I first tried a tiny amount and that stuff creased in like an hour</li>
            <li>I always come back to this primer in between other primers, but I have never been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m sure countless other people)</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looks exactly the same at the end of the day as it did when I applied it.</li>
            <li>First of all the product came 2 weeks later than suggested, when i asked the company about it all I got was a copy of a shipping order and that it was out of their hands.</li>
            <li>this product makes your eyeshadow look freshly applied all day long.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This product makes your eyeshadow color pop a little more than normal and it helps it last all day.</li>
            <li>If you are in an environment where your eyeshadow has a tendency to fade throughout the day, this primer helps it to stick without clumping which ultimately allows you better coverage with a lot less usage.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many great things about Urban Decay, usually their stuff is too expensive for me...</li>
            <li>I love UD&#x27;s primer potion, the only problem I have is that it was starting to dry out after a while (over a year)</li>
            <li>I was just extremely excited to find it at half the cost of Ulta.</li>
            <li>It keeps my eyeshadow on all day and for the most part without creases-even after a hard workout.</li>
            <li>Teens love to have their hard work</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying i&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Urban Decay and this primer potion, but this particular bottle...i&#x27;m not sure if this is the REAL thing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it twice for special occasions that were long.</li>
            <li>(it dries clear)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a clear delineation between the edge of the primer and the edge of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is watch a few videos on youtube that describe how to properly cut up the package and save every last drop of this amazing primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about all day traveling on an airplane days, all day in the car days, early to work and</li>
            <li>It brings out colors well for a natural look.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a eye primer that will make your eyemakeup last through out the whole day and night, this would be the product for you.</li>
            <li>But overall it kept my eye makeup on throughout my whole occasion, without smudging or caking.</li>
            <li>It makes eyeshadow application much smoother and gives an all day lasting look.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product my shadow would fade into my skin by mid-day.</li>
            <li>As far as the product itself goes?</li>
            <li>Urban Decay didn&#x27;t name this potion for nothing, it really does it job.</li>
            <li>The potion sometimes makes my eyelids sting, and I do NOT have sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a review on here from someone who said that the product made her look like an old lady.</li>
            <li>It really makes the eyeshadow last longer and never smears</li>
            <li>I really just use tiny amount that I apply with the applicator on my lid and spread with the tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps your eye shadow and eye liner on your eye throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left inside the tube.</li>
            <li>An eyeshadow base it is, and an excellent one at that.</li>
            <li>Also,,, It took a little bit longer to remove my eye makeup, but soooooo worth it!</li>
            <li>and I am not sure if it is authentic Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>It will last a really long time and is definitely worth all of the money.</li>
            <li>I use nyx high definition primer and it cost me only 7 dollars vs this at almost $20.</li>
            <li>You will need to know how much to add and how long to wait before you apply your eyeshadow</li>
            <li>It dries fast and primes your eye lid well for eye shadow which then lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>The company responded to this by tilting the bunny foot so that it reaches the sides of the container, but since the container is not clear, there is no way to tell if you are really getting all the product.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit, and make sure to let it dry completely before applying eye shadow and liner.  </li>
            <li>In response to this, Urban Decay has changed the shape of the wand (currently bent, rather than straight).  </li>
            <li>: does what it is supposed to do, keeps my eyeshadow lasting for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: issues with the bottle, the price is pretty steep</li>
            <li>After years of having my eye makeup only last 3 or 4 hours before it smeared and creased, I had my doubts that a primer would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the most expensive makeup, so this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>I use no other brand of primer.</li>
            <li>This eye primer is decent, but my eye liner does crease a little still, but not as much as before.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth (not too thick, sticky, or dry, like the Bare Minerals shadow primers), and is basically invisible under all of my eyeshadows, even the nude/neutral colors.  </li>
            <li>I left it in too long (30 secs) and it melted the whole container.  </li>
            <li>The only way to get it completely off is to use eye makeup remover or some sort of oil-based solvent (like baby oil or lotion).</li>
            <li>do have to say that some ladies I have talked to have found it takes a little while to find the right amount that works for you.</li>
            <li>I apply a light coat in the morning, wait a few seconds for it to dry, then add eye shadow, and the shadow lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have to use much less eye shadow once this has been applied first and this product will save me a lot of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see the difference between this primer and any other brand.</li>
            <li>when you try to clean your eye makeup before going to bed, you have to rub it hard to make it come off.</li>
            <li>I did combine this with a product called model in a bottle and it made my make-up as a whole last all day going on 13hrs on a rainy humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied its not thick or heavy.</li>
            <li>If you are using it with brighter colors then I would suggest something a little more heavy duty like the Mac ones.</li>
            <li>I never was able to wear eyeshadow before because it would always rub off a few hours after putting it on but with this I wear eyeshadow everyday</li>
            <li>I have tried a few primers that are less expensive and more expensive, but by far, this is the BEST primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>this is a truly great product but the applicator broke after about 3 weeks really disappointed about the turn out of this product.</li>
            <li>I have used other lines and different types of eyeshadow primer and this is the one that really works.</li>
            <li>It is a small bottle but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you have oily eyelids like me, this will really tone down the oily so eyeshadow will stay put.</li>
            <li>Second of all i was sent a whole other product, the eyeshadow primer i was sent came in a gold bottle with a purple lid and was not white like this one is.</li>
            <li>This product clearly works for a lot of people, but if you have dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>:) I used to save it for special occasions because I was too afraid to run out of it, but I recently started wearing it everyday and cannot imagine how i didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>After about 4-5 hours I notice a little creasing, but its only noticable i you look really close.  </li>
            <li>The main reason is I feel, deep down in my most-frugal of hearts, that there has to be a lower cost alternative-</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, even with the extensive reviews I&#x27;d skimmed on multiple websites, I&#x27;d never caught the secret about removing the little plastic insert at the top of the bottle once you&#x27;re completely out of primer.</li>

            <li> This is a great product and one of the essentials when it comes to applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Works as great as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I was happy with it, so</li>
            <li> If I had used makeup remover it would have come off, but it just goes to show what a great product it is.  </li>
            <li> This was a great buy and now a must in my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, UDPP is great.  </li>

            <li> than that this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product that I have recommended to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> But it worked great in the beginning.</li>
            <li> but hey, so is the price of beauty lol.</li>

            <li> Great product and I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> and she said it was a great product.</li>
            <li> She looked great for some photos we took.</li>
            <li> If you want to take the time to dab the primer onto an eyeshadow brush and then apply it works great.</li>
            <li> its a great primer  </li>
            <li> but this is great product</li>

            <li> Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!!</li>
            <li> Faced primer is also very popular, but I prefer this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tilted applicator comes in very handy for those of us that do not want to contort our hands and arms just to apply eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Did I mention it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love eye make-up, and this product is a great find!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it has changed my life when it comes to make-up!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most perfect product in the world....</li>
            <li> saying that it is an amazing product and that it does not fade, and with my oily skin I thought it would be perfect, but its not as amazing as its all cracked up to be.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and well worth the money :D</li>
            <li> makes shadows, liners, and mascara stay bright and un-smudged all day.</li>
            <li> the gold color was so pigmented it shown brightly through any eyeshadow</li>
            <li> A good buy</li>
            <li> For example, I walk 3 miles to and from work every day in a fairly humid climate, and when I take my eye makeup off at night, it still looks like I JUST put it on.</li>
            <li> I used it under my makeup for a wedding, and my eye makeup looked as good at 1am as it did at 1pm.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day your eye shadow will look almost as good as when you put it on that morning.  </li>
            <li> It is a good primer</li>
            <li> Keeps it all looking good through activity, even heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> the primer is so good.</li>
            <li> Its good.  </li>
            <li> than all that, it&#x27;s a good product, just a bit pricey for a girl like me.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to work this good through out the summer months.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this from sephora and I loved it then.</li>
            <li> , I was very pleased and service was good from this company.</li>
            <li> and I am always very happy with how true the color of the shadow turns out over this product.</li>
            <li> If money is not a problem, then it&#x27;s a great deal :)</li>
            <li> Based on many youtube beauty blog&#x27;s great review, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works great, I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It helps to make the eye shadow stick out more and keeps it in place until you take it off!</li>
            <li> I love EVERYTHING about this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this primer!  </li>
            <li> I work in a hot enviroment and my shadow always looks great!</li>
            <li> I was wearing was a lot more noticeable!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li> This primer is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously amazing now after I tried it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutley amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to put under the lower lashes to prevent eyeliner from creasing as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that effective, the primer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best though.</li>
            <li> Also perfect for ladies who go out clubbing the whole night too.     </li>
            <li> My daughter bought it and liked it</li>
            <li> so I got some and liked it.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends house and could not wait to order my own.</li>
            <li> My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way.</li>
            <li> My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> First, the product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I also love how easy it is to blend the eyeshadow together, so if your looking for a great primer for your eyeshadow, Oily skin or not, you need to try it, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!)</li>
            <li> They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!)</li>
            <li> As a Makeup Artist I knew this was going to be an amazing product already, as I have always loved Urban Decay - but the price from this seller was the best part!</li>
            <li> This works so good that my eyeshadows even show kinda true colors that they have never shown before applying this!</li>
            <li> I am now able to use even cheap eyeshadow with great results.</li>
            <li> Product went on very easy...</li>
            <li> Love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, and it genuinely does do a good job as a primer.</li>
            <li> I love love love it and would reccommend it to anyone who inquires about a good eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my own fault, thinking 10ml/.34oz would be more</li>
            <li> I have many of their eye kits, and always get a primer potion deluxe sample with the kit.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best primer I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> my make up stays on  looks as fresh  just a great products</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> and of course higher end ones work great as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had heard about it through a friend and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Has to be put on very light...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight, so having this product in your purse won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> You can use a VERY light hand on the fade-ier sections, or just a lighter color (which I feel works better.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great, if you have very fair skin, for covering up little vein lines or spots on your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> more clarity&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love using this product whenever i use eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Of course, it took a bit of practice for the eyeshadow, but after some time, I was able to figure that out too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE that also.</li>
            <li> : Put a layer of mascara on your top lashes before you apply the shawdow, if any shadow falls, it falls on your lashes, not your face.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It might have been better if they just put it in a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I love makeup, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  </li>
            <li> If you have cheap eyeshadows that doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin well, use this!</li>
            <li> my video, I&#x27;ll tell you why I love the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, what it does for me and even show you the awesome applicator to apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this product exists.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this one blends in with most skin tones</li>
            <li> I love this primer and had to go to the hospital and had it on and it lasted for two days till my husband brought my makeup remover to me</li>
            <li> I use them interchangeably and have not found that one is better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li> Better than what I was using for my lids-- a face primer by Veil.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> You also have to depot it after some time to get all the product out because, although the shape is cute, the wand won&#x27;t reach it all.</li>
            <li> I love the way it sets my liner and shadow, PLUS</li>
            <li> Splurg on your primer, go cheep on eyeshadow... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Still, though, for the price, you&#x27;d like to be able to get the most mileage from the product.</li>
            <li> After using it once, I have rekindled my love of eye makeup.</li>
            <li> There are many videos on YouTube on how to get most of the product out of the package.</li>
            <li> but then I decided to try it once more</li>
            <li> but this time I used a lot more, and it work</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my eye shadow stay in place, even in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this primer, but one thing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I do love there powder foundation in fantasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a brush that comes off (like a lipgloss), and if the top breaks, it just dries up inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just prefer to get more bang for my buck with Too Faced&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> Looked kind of cheap to me</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, been using for years</li>
            <li> I got this primer relatively fast in great packaging.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely love this potion.</li>
            <li> Cheap, cheap pots of glitter eyeshadow for 4 bucks with this primer, and it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> wish I could figure out why so many people love this, but . . .</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this eye primer.  </li>
            <li> Urban Decay is the best I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> However, if it isn&#x27;t authentic, I don&#x27;t know how safe it is on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> this stops the watering, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeshadow primers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Love the wand applicator.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay is a wonderful brand.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Urban Decay eyeshadow and primer and finds that this works the best.  </li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> so I tried to heat it in the microwave to get the liquid flowing better.  </li>
            <li> I see now that it is not any better than the cheaper Elf product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using foundation powder under my shadow works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> But I guess that is the price you pay for the cute bottle.  </li>
            <li> this primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I am so glad now that I didn&#x27;t listen to her.  </li>
            <li> but it does work and it makes you eye makeup look better than before.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be the top notch primer on the make up</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and held my eyeshadow all day!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product ♡♡</li>
            <li> I love this primer.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow looks much better @</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Right now I am 7 hours into my day and my golds are just as bright and un-oily as at 7am this morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for about 8-9 months now and so far it has been a good one!</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on a kit, but mainly bought it to try this out.</li>
            <li> I loved this primer for the first year I used it.</li>
            <li> I loved it from first use.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good primer.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a good thing for me, but be aware of that</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my eye make-up in perfect condition all day long.</li>
            <li> This primer is one of the best for shadow to stay put all day long.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> the primer was brand new as stated and of great quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really very cool</li>
            <li> It was the best $18 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This was great eye primer my shadow last most of the day and no crease in my eye lids :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really looking for a good eye primer</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advice of a friend and after the first time using it, I am officially in love!  </li>
            <li> i dont have any other words but perfect.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest, about 6 years ago, I first tried this product, and I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why people loved it so much.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with the applicator and my eye shadow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, isn&#x27;t sticky, and gives the eye shadow</li>
            <li> fantastic, quick and great handling thanks</li>
            <li> Good make-up is wasted without a great primer, which is this.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> eye\\&quot; look, the colors blend easily and stay blended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> The primer dries clear and is really good for keeping make-up on if you&#x27;re going to be out of the house for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a great product and definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I can swipe both lids without re-dunking the applicator and that works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, easy to apply and must have for all ladies out there.</li>
            <li> The price might seem a bit steep for this little bottle but trust me, it&#x27;s the best investment.  </li>
            <li> This primer makes a huge difference in the length of time</li>
            <li> It went on so smooth and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> The primer goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how it really pulls out the pigment of the shadow.  </li>
            <li> This primer works great for my eyeshadow, especially the mineral eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB and honestly one of the best primers out there, but UDPP has to DUMBEST packaging possible - I plan to open it up and depot it.</li>
            <li> Just go light...</li>
            <li> The results will be smooth, streak-free,and crease free.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my eyes and it went on so smoothly</li>
            <li> It goes on globby and looks globby even if you try to smooth it out with your finger.  </li>
            <li> My eye shadow lasts all day with just a light coat of this in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product helps eye shadow glide on smoothly and stay on without creasing.  </li>
            <li> My eyeshadow is cheap stuff from the beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t cheap for what it is.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primer.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control.</li>
            <li> Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control.</li>
            <li> but this stuff works great and last.</li>
            <li> --my eye make up still looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m not using this for bright, super chic colors, I&#x27;ve used it with a pretty wide spectrum of looks and it&#x27;s been consistently great.</li>
            <li> I never used to use eyeshadow primer &amp; now I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s been my whole life !!!</li>
            <li> I know it is a very popular product, and I have to say that it definitely lives up to the hype!  </li>
            <li> The original UD eyeshadow primer potion is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you enough good things about this product - it&#x27;s an absolute must-have for women (and some adventurous men!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing $3 Hot Topic eyeshadows over it for testing right now and they look spectacular]</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when Sin came out.</li>
            <li> I am soooo excited about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> by the end of the day, my eyeshadow still looked fresh!</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the money!</li>
            <li> so worth the money!</li>
            <li> My eyes look great, no creases, and make up lasts all night long.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow primer makes your eyeshadow look just as rich on your eyes as it is on the palette, and it makes it stay on ALL day.</li>
            <li> With the original product my eye shadow did not budge at all.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a sample with a palette I bought.</li>
            <li> I love this product soooo much!</li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> UD seems to be pretty top notch.</li>
            <li> Definitely try this out if you find a price you&#x27;re satisfied with!:)</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> However, just like how the application took a bit of practice, trying to keep the product clean took a bit of practice as well.     </li>
            <li> It also makes the shadow go on smoothly and more intensely.</li>
            <li> But the unexpected benefit and the thing I love the most is that it prevents my eyeliner from smudging.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, and i think i will stick to it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eye primer on the market!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for someone special.</li>
            <li> PLUS, it makes eyeshadow so much more vibrant!</li>
            <li> The colors of all my shadows are more true and intense</li>
            <li> amazing, completely does everything it says and</li>
            <li> If I pay as much as I&#x27;m willing to pay from such a store, I expect something great.</li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is way cute and the bottle it comes in seems very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full color.</li>
            <li> I do make up as a hobby for wedding, senior pictures, and sweet 16&#x27;s/15&#x27;s birthdays</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and most products do not work.</li>
            <li> I can get through my entire work day and my eye makeup still looks good.</li>
            <li> Primer will keep a thick layer of shadow in perfect place, never looses shimmer.</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay full price at a makeup store.</li>
            <li> This product really does keep your eye shadow from creasing, but you have to make sure you apply is under your foundation/base color.</li>
            <li> In the sweltering heat my lids get really oily and without this magical primer</li>
            <li> I am sure it lasts longer during winter when my oil gland don&#x27;t get activated as much.</li>
            <li> This seems like a really good product to make eye shadow last longer with out creasing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> Given as a present and the receiver said she loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other reviews have touched up on this, and may be able to offer better insight.</li>
            <li> after using urban decay primer potion (which feel so creamy and smooth and lovely!)</li>
            <li> It also makes the color of eye shadow more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It promotes a more vibrant looking eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It glides on and dries quickly</li>
            <li> Another example: last night I fell asleep with my makeup still on; when I woke up, my eye makeup was still flawless, even after applying it 24 hours earlier, and sleeping on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty slick eyelids that would always make even the best eyeshadows just disappear in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> It makes eye shadows more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d better hope that you don&#x27;t have any crow&#x27;s feet, because it will only make them look crepe-y and more intensified.</li>
            <li> My eyeliner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help.</li>
            <li> So shipping was extremely quick</li>
            <li> Arrived really quickly</li>
            <li> I love using lots of bright colors, and up until I found Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, I was never able to get eyeshadow colors as bright as it seems like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Is amazing, eyeshadows last all day long, consistency is light and smells good.</li>
            <li> Also makes the eyeshadow color more vibrant and pretty!</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re interested in cheap eyeshadow palettes you should look into Coastal Scents.)</li>
            <li> A year ago we moved to a very hot climate and my eye makeup was disappearing until I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from Sephora and the first time I tried it I was blown away.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this item and I am still very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> This is my very first purchase from UD.</li>
            <li> set came in a cute little package and very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> So, I live in Texas, have oily skin and LOVE powdered eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the half of what I utilized worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times on my eyeshadow and have been asked many times how it stays on for so long.    </li>
            <li> I guess that wasn&#x27;t wise since I do have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow stayed on for 2 days if you want long lasting wear from your eyeshadow use this product best I ever used</li>
            <li> Helps eyeshadow to stay on very well, and is easy to work</li>
            <li> i never use eyeshadow without using this primer first!</li>
            <li> Do mascara FIRST!</li>
            <li> Get ready to fend off suitors!!</li>
            <li> Get ready to fend off suitors!!</li>
            <li> It helps the colors show up very vibrant and smooth.</li>
            <li> With a little primer beneath my eye as well as on my lids, it prevents that smearing and my eyeliner looks as great at the end of the day as it does five minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and I will be wearing makeup more often mainly because of this item.</li>
            <li> But using it with browns, golds, black and other more neutral colors, it works great!</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants their eyeshadow to look great and stay on for a long time, I suggest you buy this!!!</li>
            <li> Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion is amazing.</li>
            <li> I actually found out about this product from a makeup tutorial on Youtube, and primer potion is amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and silky and you don&#x27;t need to much.</li>
            <li> amazing bonus is that the primer makes my shadow and liner last ALL DAY!  </li>
            <li> I applied my eye shadow and they didnt come out as bright as I expected them to</li>
            <li> really well [even cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because it was reasonably priced and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Primer potion is truly an amazing eye primer by Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li> Best kept secret in my kaboodle.</li>
            <li> I am indeed a fan, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> more.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money found my life time eye shadow primer</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup looking fresh and perfect all day long; it looks like I just applied the makeup even at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and blend, and it makes my eyeshadow look vibrant and stay put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I honestly can never go back to doing my makeup without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Professional Size this time :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li> , i attempted to make this worth for the eye shadow</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works a lot vetter with Urban Decays own eye make up.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> There are better primers out there, even their other eyeshadow primers do a better job than this watery one.</li>
            <li> It really makes the color of the shadow more vibrant and crease proof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve tried so far and really makes your shadow last most of the day with limited creasing.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I turn right around and buy it again and again.  </li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a tube with the ability to just squeeze out the right amount.</li>
            <li> right in place.</li>
            <li> My makeup can last a full 14+ hours with this :)</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, no creasing, and your vibrant color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the great reviews for this product--but it works great!  </li>
            <li> This potion keeps my shadow fresh like it was when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 12+ hours with crease-free lids that looked as fresh as when I first applied my shadow.</li>
            <li> I use the original mainly for my eyeshadows, and I use Sin alone.    </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> For that reason, I likely won&#x27;t repurchase this brand, but it definitely works great...</li>
            <li> consistency is nice, blends out and dries fast - almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I have very oily lids and this helped tremendously with keeping my shadow where it should be.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was great, I definitely like the vintage bottle better then the new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is awesome, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> It also helps you use less of your makeup products, which in the long run, saves you money and keeps you looking great!</li>
            <li> It is sheer and very light...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what eyeshadow brand you use this with, it will make any eyeshadow go on smoother, blend better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I love urban decay to began with!</li>
            <li> and still have so much more left.</li>
            <li> Only using three small dabs, it was the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a primer that actually worked!  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> When I first stated using the primer</li>
            <li> This is the first eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a thicker primer something along the lines of the Mac Paint Pots at first</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY oily!</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what you need it to</li>
            <li> My first issue is that it goes on oily.</li>
            <li> and this does absolutely everything it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> The top broke off the second week I got it</li>
            <li> Will never go out without priming with this first.</li>
            <li> it looks like it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> This product really does work!</li>
            <li> Maybe if I had an eye makeup remover, it would have been easier, hahaha!</li>
            <li> With this product it looks fresh until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> With this primer, it looks fresh and can be as intense as you want it to all day.  </li>
            <li> I use it everytime and it never fails.</li>
            <li> when I first read reviews for this, I knew about the genie bottle vs. tube styles, and knew this one was going to be the bottle,</li>
            <li> (I knew I wasn&#x27;t ever going to do that, but I was aware that was an option</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this but, payed way to much at the mall!</li>
            <li> I love your Naked pallettes</li>
            <li> Put this product on first then apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li> If you want to look at the end of your day like you looked in the VERY beginning, buy this!</li>
            <li> Really that&#x27;s all I can say about this product!  </li>
            <li> I just make sure my lid is covered and rub off any extra.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :)</li>
            <li> Love potion #9 is how I feel about Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye primer</li>
            <li> I was suggested by another review to buy this product, and although I was hesitant based on the price, I can absolutely say that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon helps to find the lowest price, and I&#x27;ve been able to find it for a decent price at my local makeup store.</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed, eyeshadow stayed on all day without creasing and stayed just as vibrant as when I applied it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Generally, my eyeliner would smudge, lighten, and smear downward giving a bit of a light &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; throughout the day that I had to be aware of.</li>
            <li> ill order from u more often keep up the good work</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay primer comes in a cute bottle, but I feel like you don&#x27;t get as much product as you do with Too Faced.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product in both the Original (which is a translucent color with a matte finish) as well as the Sin (which is a very pretty neutral color in a shimmery finish).</li>
            <li> Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all</li>
            <li> I can be up and running for 16 hours straight and by the end of the day my eye shadow looks like it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought the tube version, and the first time I used it, the end of the tube burst and much of the product oozed out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty much out of it already.  </li>
            <li> but when i first tried i noticed that its very oily.</li>
            <li> I love having my eyeshadow stay on where I put it all day long</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to Mary Kay, Laura Mercier, and other eyeshadow primers in my experience.     </li>
            <li> but still you get it for free...and even if you want it by itself you can most likely get it for cheaper than how much this person wants....</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, but have never had any type of reaction while using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item authentic, a lil primer goes a long way or it will crease, brings out the color in eyeshadows n</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s super cute, it ends up leaving quite a bit of product in the bottle, which gets wasted.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent primer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don&#x27;t like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don&#x27;t like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it.</li>
            <li> This really delivers as promised.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and always had a problem keeping my Eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for sharing....</li>
            <li> It helped eye shadow and eye liner stay on the whole day without greasing and smear.</li>
            <li> The two things that I absolutely about this product: 1.</li>
            <li> how light and sheer it feels, and 2.</li>
            <li> For real, not one crease, smudge or flake.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> Now it stays put all day and for much of the evening.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this one with a bright green, yellow and blue shadows (not together though) and they stay on most of the day</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;re ready to apply makeup.    </li>
            <li> This potion doesn&#x27;t really work to prevent creasing with oily lids.</li>
            <li> The product is very pricey</li>
            <li> Also it really does stay on, so</li>
            <li> It makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this stuff keeps my eyeshadow from smearing, creasing, running or flaking.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the primer in \\&quot;sin\\&quot; this time around and do not like it as much.</li>
            <li> I think I paid too much for this for it to be in this condition.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I order this because it was cheap, and I wanted to try Urban Decay products.</li>
            <li> but i do think thats too much for the primer...</li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Girlfit from Makeupalley for the hint</li>
            <li> Helps blend colors smoothly and it came 4 days than it was suppose to overall</li>
            <li> I was really, truly amazed with this product.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really think it worked, so I just decided not to use the product.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I think that says a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I used to like the straight applicator they had, but you could never get all the product out of the container.</li>
            <li> You can use the wand once the tube gets emptier, but a newer tube will have too much product on it to wipe around.</li>
            <li> You can attempt to blend, but the colors won&#x27;t move around too much.</li>
            <li> You can attempt to blend, but the colors won&#x27;t move around too much.</li>
            <li> Really does make your shadow stay brighter for longer.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny smear of the potion on each lid then gently smooth it over my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really argue with all the reviews here.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> My eye shadow still creases but it takes much longer for it to do so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with knowing how much to put on or when to put it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone in search of a primer!</li>
            <li> But in my opinion, this product is worth the messy self-education... :)</li>
            <li> I finally tried the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the color more vibrant and it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does with any other primer, even the really cheap ones that come in the eyeshadow trio</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought afew other eye shadow primers and have had difficulty being able to blend, stay blended, or even work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With this primer, my eyeshadow stays vibrant and lasts much, much longer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants their shadow to stay well, not crease and look vibrant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another really great thing - because you need so little, each bottle will last you quite a long time, making the $25 price tag not nearly as painful.</li>
            <li> I am assured that I am getting the true color of my Urban Decay shadow without the under hues of my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The primer tube is a bit larger than a full sized tube of mascara, and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; is a stick with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely try to leave the house with a full face done.</li>
            <li> I love it and will never use any other product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every single penny, and if you own expensive eyeshadows and don&#x27;t wear a good primer, then you are totally wasting money.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and keeps my eyeshadow from creasing.</li>
            <li> I can also apply less eyeshadow and get better results than before when I used to apply and apply and apply before I got the color intensity I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just for the older set.  </li>
            <li> so putting on a product that makes me older</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had it last through a humid day and when I got home, my makeup looked exactly as it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> I love Urban Decay -- especially their 24/7 eye pencils.  </li>
            <li> It keeps eyeshadow on and vibrant until I want to take it off at night.</li>
            <li> You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don&#x27;t want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes!</li>
            <li> an extra moisturizer!liner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help.</li>
            <li> You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don&#x27;t want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes!</li>
            <li> I could say \\&quot;bye, bye\\&quot; to a decent eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it normally sells for $18-$20 at most makeup stores which is a little more than I like to spend on a tiny tube of primer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for any age.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for ALL women.</li>
            <li> My daughter would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey, but I have yet to find one that works better.</li>
            <li> You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it.</li>
            <li> You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it.</li>
            <li> It does make the colors a little more</li>
            <li> Absolutely no creasing of my eyeshadow and eyeshadow in general looks so much more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow Primer Potion to every girl, even if you don&#x27;t have trouble with your eyeshadow creasing, It&#x27;s great for making your eyeshadow last all day or night.</li>
            <li> normally, it&#x27;s all wiped off within 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i use it everyday...</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> For the record, this works and prevents my lids from turning into a greasy pit by the end of a normal work day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye makeup primers, but this one actually does what it promises-crease-free, smudge-free, all day long until you take your makeup off with remover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really worth the price, but it definitely make my eye liner go on a lot easier!</li>
            <li> I normally like to use just two colors a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; darker color, and a lighter \\&quot;highligter\\&quot; type of color.</li>
            <li> so I feel like normally my eye make-up melts off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and covers well - makes a great base for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I had a super long work day</li>
            <li> I saw they came out with a new tube version though, which I&#x27;m looking forward to trying.  </li>
            <li> here(I live in Texas).</li>
            <li> I do not like this primer searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> Just gotta make sure that you really want the eyeshadow you put on your eyes because if you try to rub it...it&#x27;s hard to get off without using soap and water.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more solid and blend in my skin like my foundation.</li>
            <li> Not now, I apply Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion on first, and my Eyeshadow stays on all day and into the night..</li>
            <li> I used it the first day and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years, and I absolutely LOVE this product.    </li>
            <li> Primer Potion totally fixed that!</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion is the first thing I put on my eyes every day.  </li>
            <li> Eyelids may constitute a small square footage of your epidermis, but they have oil glands, too; just try touching them at the end of the day and you might feel how greasy they can be.</li>
            <li> However, the other colors (Sin, Eden) do NOT work as well as the original.    </li>
            <li> , I first tried a tiny amount and that stuff creased in like an hour</li>
            <li> I always come back to this primer in between other primers, but I have never been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m sure countless other people)</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow looks exactly the same at the end of the day as it did when I applied it.</li>
            <li> First of all the product came 2 weeks later than suggested, when i asked the company about it all I got was a copy of a shipping order and that it was out of their hands.</li>
            <li> this product makes your eyeshadow look freshly applied all day long.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This product makes your eyeshadow color pop a little more than normal and it helps it last all day.</li>
            <li> If you are in an environment where your eyeshadow has a tendency to fade throughout the day, this primer helps it to stick without clumping which ultimately allows you better coverage with a lot less usage.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many great things about Urban Decay, usually their stuff is too expensive for me...</li>
            <li> I love UD&#x27;s primer potion, the only problem I have is that it was starting to dry out after a while (over a year)</li>
            <li> I was just extremely excited to find it at half the cost of Ulta.</li>
            <li> It keeps my eyeshadow on all day and for the most part without creases-even after a hard workout.</li>
            <li> Teens love to have their hard work</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Urban Decay and this primer potion, but this particular bottle...i&#x27;m not sure if this is the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it twice for special occasions that were long.</li>
            <li> (it dries clear)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a clear delineation between the edge of the primer and the edge of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is watch a few videos on youtube that describe how to properly cut up the package and save every last drop of this amazing primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about all day traveling on an airplane days, all day in the car days, early to work and</li>
            <li> It brings out colors well for a natural look.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a eye primer that will make your eyemakeup last through out the whole day and night, this would be the product for you.</li>
            <li> But overall it kept my eye makeup on throughout my whole occasion, without smudging or caking.</li>
            <li> It makes eyeshadow application much smoother and gives an all day lasting look.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product my shadow would fade into my skin by mid-day.</li>
            <li> As far as the product itself goes?</li>
            <li> Urban Decay didn&#x27;t name this potion for nothing, it really does it job.</li>
            <li> The potion sometimes makes my eyelids sting, and I do NOT have sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a review on here from someone who said that the product made her look like an old lady.</li>
            <li> It really makes the eyeshadow last longer and never smears</li>
            <li> I really just use tiny amount that I apply with the applicator on my lid and spread with the tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps your eye shadow and eye liner on your eye throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left inside the tube.</li>
            <li> An eyeshadow base it is, and an excellent one at that.</li>
            <li> Also,,, It took a little bit longer to remove my eye makeup, but soooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is authentic Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> It will last a really long time and is definitely worth all of the money.</li>
            <li> I use nyx high definition primer and it cost me only 7 dollars vs this at almost $20.</li>
            <li> You will need to know how much to add and how long to wait before you apply your eyeshadow</li>
            <li> It dries fast and primes your eye lid well for eye shadow which then lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> The company responded to this by tilting the bunny foot so that it reaches the sides of the container, but since the container is not clear, there is no way to tell if you are really getting all the product.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit, and make sure to let it dry completely before applying eye shadow and liner.  </li>
            <li> In response to this, Urban Decay has changed the shape of the wand (currently bent, rather than straight).  </li>
            <li> : does what it is supposed to do, keeps my eyeshadow lasting for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: issues with the bottle, the price is pretty steep</li>
            <li> After years of having my eye makeup only last 3 or 4 hours before it smeared and creased, I had my doubts that a primer would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the most expensive makeup, so this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> I use no other brand of primer.</li>
            <li> This eye primer is decent, but my eye liner does crease a little still, but not as much as before.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth (not too thick, sticky, or dry, like the Bare Minerals shadow primers), and is basically invisible under all of my eyeshadows, even the nude/neutral colors.  </li>
            <li> I left it in too long (30 secs) and it melted the whole container.  </li>
            <li> The only way to get it completely off is to use eye makeup remover or some sort of oil-based solvent (like baby oil or lotion).</li>
            <li> do have to say that some ladies I have talked to have found it takes a little while to find the right amount that works for you.</li>
            <li> I apply a light coat in the morning, wait a few seconds for it to dry, then add eye shadow, and the shadow lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have to use much less eye shadow once this has been applied first and this product will save me a lot of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see the difference between this primer and any other brand.</li>
            <li> when you try to clean your eye makeup before going to bed, you have to rub it hard to make it come off.</li>
            <li> I did combine this with a product called model in a bottle and it made my make-up as a whole last all day going on 13hrs on a rainy humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied its not thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> If you are using it with brighter colors then I would suggest something a little more heavy duty like the Mac ones.</li>
            <li> I never was able to wear eyeshadow before because it would always rub off a few hours after putting it on but with this I wear eyeshadow everyday</li>
            <li> I have tried a few primers that are less expensive and more expensive, but by far, this is the BEST primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> this is a truly great product but the applicator broke after about 3 weeks really disappointed about the turn out of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other lines and different types of eyeshadow primer and this is the one that really works.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you have oily eyelids like me, this will really tone down the oily so eyeshadow will stay put.</li>
            <li> Second of all i was sent a whole other product, the eyeshadow primer i was sent came in a gold bottle with a purple lid and was not white like this one is.</li>
            <li> This product clearly works for a lot of people, but if you have dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> :) I used to save it for special occasions because I was too afraid to run out of it, but I recently started wearing it everyday and cannot imagine how i didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> After about 4-5 hours I notice a little creasing, but its only noticable i you look really close.  </li>
            <li> The main reason is I feel, deep down in my most-frugal of hearts, that there has to be a lower cost alternative-</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, even with the extensive reviews I&#x27;d skimmed on multiple websites, I&#x27;d never caught the secret about removing the little plastic insert at the top of the bottle once you&#x27;re completely out of primer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the primer all the time, usually for times when I know I have a long day or will be somewhere where it is hot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the primer all the time, usually for times when I know I have a long day or will be somewhere where it is hot</li>
            <li> last the entire day long too.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with Urban Decay&#x27;s primer is that I don&#x27;t think one bottle lasts nearly as long as the Too Faced tube does.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers found their makeup difficult to remove, but I used an eye makeup remover on cotton swabs, and it came off very easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on super thick!</li>
            <li> Helps eyeshadow last all day long.  </li>
            <li> I can go for hours without having to reapply and I believe that this primer helped it last as long as it did.</li>
            <li> I use make-up remover (vaseline works, too) and those round cotton pads for this since I normally have waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I use make-up remover (vaseline works, too) and those round cotton pads for this since I normally have waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> You have to put on a really small amount, smooth it out, let it dry for a few seconds, and THEN keep on going with your eyeshadow/eyeliner, etc.</li>
            <li> So far Urban Decay seems to be a little</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it will be hard to rub the eye makeup off later.</li>
            <li> Thought that it was drying and difficult to spread easily.  </li>
            <li> This product did not live up to that standard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about new products at first, but I have to say this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I did buy the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; size which is a squeeze tube but am bummed to find out that much of the product is wasted due to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way that with this primer, you dont have to coat on as much eyeshadow as you would without it.  </li>
            <li> It is too hard to see how much shadow you have on a sponge-y thing.</li>
            <li> It is too hard to see how much shadow you have on a sponge-y thing.</li>
            <li> A must have for long wearing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I have worn this primer on long days and my eyeshadow HAS NOT CREASED.  </li>
            <li> , so it lasts a long time for me.</li>
            <li> And a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does do the trick of keeping the makeup on, just not as long as I was expecting it to.</li>
            <li> I had been hesitating for a long time on buying this item</li>
            <li> I always wondered why my eccentric eyeshadows never really truly &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; the color i was applying.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyeshadows/eye makeup stay in place for a long time without smudging or caking.</li>
            <li> I need the Bobbi Brown long wear eyeshadow to keep my eyeliner on.  </li>
            <li> I also do not think that it works as well or lasts as long.</li>
            <li> It keeps your eye shadow from creasing, it stays on for a long time (even while I&#x27;m sleeping).  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow does not crease, stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Granted this tube is not very convenient in terms of getting out every last drop.  </li>
            <li> No need for a long review-</li>
            <li> Keeps my colors on all day long.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t let that minor detail sway your purchase.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t deny that it forms a good base for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Over all seems like a good product I just hate the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the Paul Dorf Lid Primer I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The key is to know how long to let it sit after smoothing the primer on my lids - for me it took only a few seconds.    </li>
            <li> I had read other reviewers write about similar experiences but hoped it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see myself going back to other</li>
            <li> The potion does not prime properly, the way other eye primers do.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it is worth it!  </li>
            <li> Now I will buy other Urban decay products.</li>
            <li> The only other eye primer that I have tried that seemed to work is Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> You apply some of this pinkish stuff over your eyelid and even up to your eyebrows, let it dry</li>
            <li> in case you have dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but my eyes are watery/oily.</li>
            <li> Word of caution however, this primer tends to dry eye lids a bit.</li>
            <li> But can dry the skin dry for centuries!</li>
            <li> A third \\&quot;medium\\&quot; color makes the process easier to fade from dark to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A third \\&quot;medium\\&quot; color makes the process easier to fade from dark to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until I used this product, I generally needed to reapply my eye shadow mid-day, and even then it would be sunk into the creases in my eyelids in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I finally broke down...</li>
            <li> Thumbs Down Urban Decay for this primer.</li>
            <li> I only need a little, so this container has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a high end makeup buyer by any means.</li>
            <li> if not a drugstore brand, then some other product that can double as a primer (though one should hesitate to put untested things on or near the delicate skin around the eyes).    </li>
            <li> Let it DRY!</li>
            <li> It works just the same at half the price.</li>
            <li> when I put the applicator back in the bottle half the product rubs off on the lip of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very few products in the beauty world live up to their claims, and this does hands down.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, and it works all day.</li>
            <li> But to warn you, only use a little dab on each eye.</li>
            <li> It was little watery and too white.</li>
            <li> then the fact that a little bit of the primer was on the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The shape of everything is a little awkward to me, could be better.</li>
            <li> It was as if the makeup I used after application was going over extreme wrinkled, dry</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers complain, this didn&#x27;t dry out or crack my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really hard for me to find a primer that actually works for my Italian oily eyelids</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which isn&#x27;t really even a complaint, is the brush.</li>
            <li> The only thing that may have been a drawback was how messy the bottle can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this is relatively rare, but I was upset that I lost some of this expensive product.</li>
            <li> Now...a few caveats: I would not necessarily insist this to be</li>
            <li> So, be careful with the eye shadow and eye liner if it is shiny or sparkly</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected and won&#x27;t reorder.  </li>
            <li> It is too thin a layer and does absolutely nothing to improve eye makeup application or extend the wearability of eye makeup.    </li>
            <li> I always had trouble with my eyeshadow lasting, creasing, ending up all over my face.</li>
            <li> I never really used primer until I bought Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> have noticed that it is harder to blend when using this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and expected to recieve it the 28th sept. -</li>
            <li> Does not last all day on my somewhat oily skin, but that&#x27;s not a huge surprise.</li>
            <li> The wand is kind of annoying</li>
            <li> Kind of wasteful and annoying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen positive reviews on YouTube, but I didn&#x27;t know if it would be that dramatic - since I&#x27;m &amp;#34;past my prime&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> However trust me this small tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Odd application but works well to keep eye shadows on for long wear.</li>
            <li> This is an above average product though it is a little drying.</li>
            <li> ( a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> remember ladies a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So, I set it aside, and I tried other products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily eyelids, so no matter what, make-up always sort of melt off of them after about 3 or 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Before I found this one, I&#x27;ve always gotten creases with every other primer.</li>
            <li> I tried some other eyeshadow primers and they didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover the imperfections (like veins) on my lids like other primers do.  </li>
            <li> But for anyone who wears foundation, you&#x27;ve got to be so careful with this stuff that it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> I took off a star due to the dryness due to the dryness I do experience after using it consecutively.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon, I had random purple flakes on my face from it.</li>
            <li> which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other eyeshadow primers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything wrond with it other</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews</li>
            <li> I bought fairly expensive eye shadow a couple weeks ago and was stunned as to how much it took to replicate its brightness and boldness when applied to my eyelids!</li>
            <li> I definitly let it dry for a few minites (work on my eyebrows) then apply eye shawdow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a million times and got several comments from people saying I looked like I was giving them an angry look because my eye shadow was much more dramatic than usual.</li>
            <li> Colors are vivid and the shadow stays put, but the product was irritating my eye lids and drying them out.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying the shadow, because you can make it too dark!  </li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Very little of this stuff goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Looks cheap, leaks, product dries around the screw cuff, ugly colored bottle, tacky design...</li>
            <li> only thing negative thing I will mention about UDPP</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype or the money.</li>
            <li> The quality itself is below average.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that you can&#x27;t get all of the primer out of the tube with the wand, I would have preferred a squeeze tube.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You should probably use a base with the primer to make the colors pop more.</li>
            <li> I went to work out yesterday, which was alternating running around a track and up and down bleachers for an hour.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to tone it down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems a bit watered down compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> does not add any bulk or weigh down your eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> Holds liquid or powder eyeshadow down.</li>
            <li> I even had a hard time taking it off one night, I had put it under some dark, smoky shadow and a little darkness still clung to my eyelids the next day.  </li>
            <li> also appreciate the fact that it neutralizes any odd coloring in my eyelids before I apply my shadow.  </li>
            <li> Every now and then, I notice a bit of shadow aggregating in the crease, but the amount is much less than what I find it</li>
            <li> It keeps my black eyeliner where it belongs.  </li>
            <li> I tried a less costly product, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s De-crease</li>
            <li> We all know that this is not true.</li>
            <li> I mean, yes it does work, but not for as long as I feel like it should.  </li>
            <li> I mean, take less than you usually do, you aren&#x27;t getting any extra off with a brush or a tissue.</li>
            <li> I mean, take less than you usually do, you aren&#x27;t getting any extra off with a brush or a tissue.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday regardless of whether I wear eyeshadow because it makes my eyelids look less oily</li>
            <li> Although it is a little pricy for eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> but I find them fading a little in brightness.</li>
            <li> while others use a little.</li>
            <li> Now, I use just a little bit of UD</li>
            <li> buying one at Macy&#x27;s, I did a little comparison</li>
            <li> It seems that spongy applicator is a little gloppy for me and I always end up smearing it around correctly with my finger anyway.</li>
            <li> I probably wasted half of it because it just dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> I had read about the whole cutting the tube and depotting</li>
            <li> It makes my eyeshadow stay on, as I use Coastal Scents which is heavily pigmented but lacks staying-power.</li>
            <li> It truly was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> said that it dried out their eyelids, but those people probably don&#x27;t need to be using it anyway because it&#x27;s made for oily skin...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you need brand names or like to waste your money...</li>
            <li> never used eyeshadow primers before so my eyeshadow/eyeliner would always fade off or run after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and it saved a LOT of otherwise wasted product).</li>
            <li> It isint heavy or oily and doesnt cake up.</li>
            <li> The paint on the bottle, however, started to chip off after a few months.</li>
            <li> And in the summer this base is absolutely indispensable.  </li>
            <li> I tried it numerous times and it makes my eye shadow crease even worse than before.  </li>
            <li> and I got it in less than a week!</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t wiping that black speck away with this primer!</li>
            <li> I wear heavy, very black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> usually I put nothing under my eyeshadow and after a few hours it clumps in the creases of my eyelids...</li>
            <li> It is a little bit hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> All of my eye shadow was a small little line by the end of the day, not anymore!</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount on the lower lash line and it keeps my pencil eyeliner from running.  </li>
            <li> That being said, when you use it, even though its a small bottle, you don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> In the past four years of using this product, I have not once had this problem.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it was expensive for a product that is the size of your mascara bottle.</li>
            <li> Sorry Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> (I usually do foundation while I wait the minute</li>
            <li> With the wand, I usually aim for the crease of my eye and blend the still-wet primer around with my fingertip.</li>
            <li> No more oily eyeshadow in the crease of my eyes.</li>
            <li> usually wear the \\&quot;smokey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just too lazy to take it off before I go to Zumba/the gym).</li>
            <li> This can make application very messy.</li>
            <li> Making it worse, my eyes will burn due to the lid oils running into my eyes.</li>
            <li> My only negative - which keeps it from being five stars - is that I find the bent applicator difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin has changed some and my lids went from dry and flakey to oily.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and its always been hard to keep eyeshadow on</li>
            <li> then out late days.  </li>
            <li> but that was the least of my worries.</li>
            <li> The jar it comes in is an awkward shape, and the bunny foot applicator can not possibly get to all the product.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not that girl at the gym, at least)</li>
            <li> But what you have to be careful of is that your eyeshadow covers the ENTIRE primer base.</li>
            <li> like at least 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s anything negative to say about this product, it&#x27;s the size.</li>
            <li> if your tired of your eye shadow running and looking like its not even there half way through the day then you need this!</li>
            <li> only thing I dislike is the lame bottle!</li>
            <li> No more, this is a must!  </li>
            <li> Between the heat, skin and fact that powdered eyeliner won&#x27;t stay in place for crap, I normally just skip it all together.</li>
            <li> Usually towards the end of the day, my eye makeup accumulates in the crease which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually I tried rubbing all of the paint off from the middle, but now it looks ugly.</li>
            <li> I solved the problem by applying clear nail polish along the base.</li>
            <li> For years I stuck with very very neutral tones, so that when it would crease, it wouldn&#x27;t be so horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle for an expensive price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy into makeup</li>
            <li> Very disappointing overall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fault the product for this, I mean it is DESIGNED to grab your shadow afterall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of makeup, but for some reason had never heard of eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> I should say that I have very oily skin (hence the nasty eye crease line), but this helps with that.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I have not experienced any cracking or creasing with the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I tend to be out and about for 16 hours straight some days and by the end of the day my eye shadow looks terrible if it&#x27;s still on at all.</li>
            <li> Just a thin layer of it underneath my eye shadow</li>
            <li> This is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing I hate about it is the applicator.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is made of really thin, brittle plastic... not ideal for this product.</li>
            <li> So...I saw the bad reviews on this product and thought \\&quot;OMG I&#x27;M GOING TO WASTE MY MONEY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Every time I put this on my eyeshadow creases like crazy also my shadow disappear I have to reapply not good at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this stuff when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> expensive as it was</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped it one day and it cracked.</li>
            <li> I cannot reward such awful packaging with my money.</li>
            <li> But this makes that fading-to-light blending process difficult.</li>
            <li> Instead of cutting the tube, use a pin or thin tweezers to pop the insert at the applicator opening out, and you can get the rest of the product out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong here, but this brand just didnt work, the packaging was horrible!</li>
            <li> But for some reason I decided to buy it anyway because I had been using Revlon creme eye shadow as a primer/base and that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> and I was mad and wanted to return this $20 bottle of mistake,</li>
            <li> I heard bad things about eye shadow primer from a friend of mine and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this item</li>
            <li> it really frustrated me and so after so research i purchased this primer.</li>
            <li> I got so sick of it</li>
            <li> Its awkward and annoying, and that is why I took away a star (yes its that annoying and</li>
            <li> was I so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Plus, no applicator to get dirty!</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> Stupid package.</li>
            <li> but maybe that was because I didnt use a base.</li>
            <li> From this base, I can walk all day made ​​up, nothing adjusting.</li>
            <li> Instead it was a GOLD base</li>
            <li> I hated it, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> shadow on my eyelids very bad stay, roll over about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Get this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will never order makeup online again.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I no longer have to worry about my eyeliner and shadow forming a nasty line in the crease of my eye about an hour after applying it!</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> and I avoided wearing eye makeup because it would crease and look awful.  </li>
            <li> However, the packaging is AWFUL!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I decided to buy this after reading a beauty review of best eyeshadow primers. This really delivers as promised. I apply a light coat in the morning, wait a few seconds for it to dry, then add eye shadow, and the shadow lasts all day. Great! The one .34 ounce tube lasted me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what eyeshadow brand you use this with, it will make any eyeshadow go on smoother, blend better and last longer. This is by far my favorite eye primer on the market!</li>
            <li> I like this that lasts long&lt;br /&gt;And makes eye shadow more clarity&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really very cool&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and always had a problem keeping my Eyeshadow on. Not now, I apply Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion on first, and my Eyeshadow stays on all day and into the night..I will never go with out it again..I also love how easy it is to blend the eyeshadow together, so if your looking for a great primer for your eyeshadow, Oily skin or not, you need to try it, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Works as described and last a while.</li>
            <li> I love urban decay to began with! all of their products are really good quality and work! hence the price but it is so worth it! if your tired of your eye shadow running and looking like its not even there half way through the day then you need this! It helps to make the eye shadow stick out more and keeps it in place until you take it off! great buy and by the way I&#x27;ve had mine for 9 moths! and still have so much more left. you only need to apply a tiny dab! remember ladies a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with eye shadow. No matter what brand of shadow I would use, it would always crease. For years I stuck with very very neutral tones, so that when it would crease, it wouldn&#x27;t be so horrible. One day I made an impulse purchase at Ulta, and this was one of the things that came in my kit. I didn&#x27;t even know something like this existed. I used it the first day and haven&#x27;t looked back. I will admit, there are some days that I forget to put it on, and I regret it later in the day. I can now wear different colors without worrying about a crease. It only takes a little bit, and it works all day. Great product.</li>
            <li> Received the product today.  The delivery was fast.  It went on so smooth and feels like silk. I would recomend this to all. Thanks for sharing....Kat</li>
            <li> I love using this product whenever i use eyeshadow. Even if i don&#x27;t use any eyeshadow i would use it for my eyeliner. It helped eye shadow and eye liner stay on the whole day without greasing and smear. It also makes the color of eye shadow more vibrant. Although it is a little pricy for eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> This product is everything that they say it is. I love it. It helps the colors show up very vibrant and smooth. It also helps with fallout because it sticks the shadow to your skin. This is a great product and one of the essentials when it comes to applying makeup. It does not crease your eyeshadow and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  Thought that it was drying and difficult to spread easily.  When I use eyeshadow, I like to use my finger to blend it - not so with this product.</li>
            <li> A must have for long wearing eyeshadow. Works as great as advertised.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the Paul Dorf Lid Primer I had used in the past.  Underwhelming.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest, about 6 years ago, I first tried this product, and I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why people loved it so much. The primer (and eyeshadow) was just not going on the way I wanted it. So, I set it aside, and I tried other products. After a year of no luck, I decided to give it another shot. I sat in front of my mirror for a bit; after a few trial and errors, I figured out my problem - I was using way too much AND putting the eyeshadow too soon. Only using three small dabs, it was the perfect amount. Of course, it took a bit of practice for the eyeshadow, but after some time, I was able to figure that out too. The key is to know how long to let it sit after smoothing the primer on my lids - for me it took only a few seconds.    The two things that I absolutely about this product: 1. how light and sheer it feels, and 2. the staying power! I&#x27;ll use it in the morning, and at the end of the evening, my eyeshadow is STILL there.    I&#x27;ve been complimented so many times on my eyeshadow and have been asked many times how it stays on for so long.    So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years, and I absolutely LOVE this product.    I was so excited when Sin came out. I absolutely LOVE that also. I use the original mainly for my eyeshadows, and I use Sin alone.    The only thing that may have been a drawback was how messy the bottle can get. Some of the product can spill out on the side, etc. However, just like how the application took a bit of practice, trying to keep the product clean took a bit of practice as well.     But in my opinion, this product is worth the messy self-education... :)</li>
            <li> I love EVERYTHING about this product! Number one thing being that it WORKS! Plus the packaging is way cute and the bottle it comes in seems very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the \\&quot;smokey eye\\&quot; for over a year now and ALWAYS have the creases within an hour and eyeshawdow where it shouldn&#x27;t be, especially when I wear metalics.&lt;br /&gt;I use  the applicator to apply the primer but use my finger to blend, that works best for me, plus I don&#x27;t mind getting makeup on my hands. I definitly let it dry for a few minites (work on my eyebrows) then apply eye shawdow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Put a layer of mascara on your top lashes before you apply the shawdow, if any shadow falls, it falls on your lashes, not your face. Works for me anyway....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, last night before I went to bed, I started my night time facial routine and could not believe my eyes!  My makeup looked as if I just applied it, my eye shadow was absolutely perfect! For real, not one crease, smudge or flake.  I am soooo excited about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: When I close my eyes to kiss I don&#x27;t have to worry about my eye shawdow looking all greasy and whack!  XOXO  Also,,, It took a little bit longer to remove my eye makeup, but soooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I never apply eyeshadow without it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes all my eyeshadows stay put and not vanish into my crease AND makes the color richer to boot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this primer before and I was happy with it, so this is my second one.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a primer that actually worked!  This product does exactly what it says.  My eyeshadow has not creased once since I have used it.  I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This primer is AMAZING.  It truly, truly works.  The price might seem a bit steep for this little bottle but trust me, it&#x27;s the best investment.  I have worn this primer on long days and my eyeshadow HAS NOT CREASED.  I repeat!  Has NOT creased!  I&#x27;m talking about all day traveling on an airplane days, all day in the car days, early to work and then out late days.  This stuff stays put.  I even had a hard time taking it off one night, I had put it under some dark, smoky shadow and a little darkness still clung to my eyelids the next day.  If I had used makeup remover it would have come off, but it just goes to show what a great product it is.  It&#x27;s also great, if you have very fair skin, for covering up little vein lines or spots on your eyelid.  Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of makeup, but for some reason had never heard of eyeshadow base. Thank goodness I have! I love using lots of bright colors, and up until I found Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, I was never able to get eyeshadow colors as bright as it seems like they are supposed to be. This stuff totally works and is really easy to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product works really well. It keeps my eyeshadow on all day and for the most part without creases-even after a hard workout. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I love it. It goes on easily with the applicator and my eye shadow looks great all day - no creases!!</li>
            <li> I love eye make-up, and this product is a great find! Before, by midday my shadow and liner would smear or rub off, or just be all collected in the crease of my lid. Now it stays put all day and for much of the evening. I adore this primer!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for myself while snooping around on Sephora&#x27;s website a while back. I got a great deal on a kit, but mainly bought it to try this out. I have oily olive skin that refuses to hold any shadow... Primer Potion totally fixed that! Right now I am 7 hours into my day and my golds are just as bright and un-oily as at 7am this morning. Incredible :) I used to save it for special occasions because I was too afraid to run out of it, but I recently started wearing it everyday and cannot imagine how i didn&#x27;t before. My only complaint, which isn&#x27;t really even a complaint, is the brush. I dab it on my lids with the wand and then have to tap it onto my eyelids evenly using my fingers. It might have been better if they just put it in a squeeze tube. Oh well, great primer!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent primer. A little bit pricey, but I have yet to find one that works better. The shape of everything is a little awkward to me, could be better. Does not last all day on my somewhat oily skin, but that&#x27;s not a huge surprise. Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and keeps my eyeshadow from creasing. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love makeup, hair, and nails. This product is a MUST! It promotes a more vibrant looking eyeshadow. I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> When I first stated using the primer it helped my oily eyelids stay matte all day but after 2 months it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  I have oily skin so my eyeshadow would fade and crease.  When I tried this primer it was like the best the beauty buy I ever purchased.  The primer goes on smoothly and lightly.  Your shadow will last all day without fading or creasing.  The color of your eyeshadow will be enhanced as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a primer and a concealer. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I no longer have to worry about my eyeliner and shadow forming a nasty line in the crease of my eye about an hour after applying it! I should say that I have very oily skin (hence the nasty eye crease line), but this helps with that. This was a great buy and now a must in my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! It saves me time and money!  My eyeshadow no longer fades through out the day so I don&#x27;t have to carry my eyeshadow for touch ups.  I can also apply less eyeshadow and get better results than before when I used to apply and apply and apply before I got the color intensity I wanted.  The colors of all my shadows are more true and intense which is amazing. I also use a small amount on the lower lash line and it keeps my pencil eyeliner from running.  This is a great product and well worth the money :D</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. This potion keeps my shadow fresh like it was when I first put it on. Best kept secret in my kaboodle.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s a must-have before you apply eyeshadow on!  If you have cheap eyeshadows that doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin well, use this! It helps!!!!!   Also makes the eyeshadow color more vibrant and pretty!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moMFMBTOFUY6MY]]In my video, I&#x27;ll tell you why I love the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, what it does for me and even show you the awesome applicator to apply it.</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s suppose to, prevents creasing, but it&#x27;s sparkly.  This is the first eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion is amazing. It makes my eyeshadow stay on, as I use Coastal Scents which is heavily pigmented but lacks staying-power. (If you&#x27;re interested in cheap eyeshadow palettes you should look into Coastal Scents.) With this primer, my eyeshadow stays vibrant and lasts much, much longer. I am indeed a fan, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the money. That being said, when you use it, even though its a small bottle, you don&#x27;t use a lot. I also don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow daily but rather weekly (sometimes several times a week), so it lasts a long time for me. I&#x27;m so glad this product exists.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing, completely does everything it says and more.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money found my life time eye shadow primer</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for about 8-9 months now and so far it has been a good one! I was expecting a thicker primer something along the lines of the Mac Paint Pots at first but this primer is a lot lighter. It glides on and dries quickly and this one blends in with most skin tones that I have used it on so no primer lines on the eye lids. It brings out colors well for a natural look. If you are using it with brighter colors then I would suggest something a little more heavy duty like the Mac ones. I have used this one with a bright green, yellow and blue shadows (not together though) and they stay on most of the day but I find them fading a little in brightness. But using it with browns, golds, black and other more neutral colors, it works great!</li>
            <li> I actually found out about this product from a makeup tutorial on Youtube, and primer potion is amazing. It keeps my makeup looking fresh and perfect all day long; it looks like I just applied the makeup even at the end of a long day. After discovering this product, I have never looked back; it&#x27;s a must have for my beauty bag! It also helps you use less of your makeup products, which in the long run, saves you money and keeps you looking great!</li>
            <li> A good buy and it helps with making your makeup go on easier.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this primer and had to go to the hospital and had it on and it lasted for two days till my husband brought my makeup remover to me, I was very pleased and service was good from this company.</li>
            <li> I had some doubts, but I put this product on around 12:00 noon, followed by my reg eyeshadow. by the end of the day, my eyeshadow still looked fresh! I was impressed and amazed. normally, it&#x27;s all wiped off within 2 hrs. unbelievable. Get this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and before I started using eyeshadow primer, after a couple of hours my makeup would disappear into my crease.  By the end of the night it would look like I had no eye makeup on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, UDPP is great.  I know it is a very popular product, and I have to say that it definitely lives up to the hype!  I would definitely recommend UDPP - I have not had any problems with creasing or my makeup \\&quot;disappearing.\\&quot;  In my opinion, UDPP and Too Faced Shadow Insurace are equivalent.  I use them interchangeably and have not found that one is better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative thing I will mention about UDPP (that I have heard from others) is that once you have used the majority of the product, the packaging can lead to some distress when it comes to getting the remaining product out.  In response to this, Urban Decay has changed the shape of the wand (currently bent, rather than straight).  I don&#x27;t know whether this has solved the problem...I imagine that it would help, but again, I haven&#x27;t reached the end of my bottle, so I haven&#x27;t encountered this situation yet.  Just something to keep in mind.  I&#x27;m sure other reviews have touched up on this, and may be able to offer better insight.</li>
            <li> A year ago we moved to a very hot climate and my eye makeup was disappearing until I bought this product.  This lasts all day and night.  Eye shadow doesn&#x27;t fade.  It looks like I just put it on all day.</li>
            <li> I had several people tell me about this product. I suffer from oily lids and am constanly asking people what they use as a primer. I had one from Avon and well it lasts for about 3-5 hours. This stuff..........all freaking day!!!!!!! It was the best $18 I&#x27;ve ever spent. No creases or oily eyelids since. Just gotta make sure that you really want the eyeshadow you put on your eyes because if you try to rub it...it&#x27;s hard to get off without using soap and water. It&#x27;s also nice to put under the lower lashes to prevent eyeliner from creasing as well.</li>
            <li> So, I live in Texas, have oily skin and LOVE powdered eyeliner. Between the heat, skin and fact that powdered eyeliner won&#x27;t stay in place for crap, I normally just skip it all together. I deided to try this stuff, and I am so impressed. I went to work out yesterday, which was alternating running around a track and up and down bleachers for an hour. I got home home and still had perfectly winged eyeliner. Now I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li> Better than what I was using for my lids-- a face primer by Veil. This eye primer is decent, but my eye liner does crease a little still, but not as much as before. Just gotta do a lil touch up 3-4 hours later. It&#x27;s easy to apply, isn&#x27;t sticky, and gives the eye shadow it&#x27;s full color.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it! Helps eyeshadow last all day long.  I only need a little, so this container has lasted a long time. I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> Of your eye shadow!  Amazing how it really pulls out the pigment of the shadow.  Be careful when applying the shadow, because you can make it too dark!  It&#x27;s that effective, the primer.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth. Helps my eyeshadow and mascara stay on longer and makes the color pop. I gave it 3 stars, because personally I think its overpriced. :/</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, and it genuinely does do a good job as a primer. Colors are vivid and the shadow stays put, but the product was irritating my eye lids and drying them out. I had read other reviewers write about similar experiences but hoped it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me. I guess that wasn&#x27;t wise since I do have dry skin. This product clearly works for a lot of people, but if you have dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This primer works great for my eyeshadow, especially the mineral eyeshadows. I can go for hours without having to reapply and I believe that this primer helped it last as long as it did. It goes on smooth and silky and you don&#x27;t need to much. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is with the price and the packaging. The price is pretty steep for the small bottle you get. You also have to depot it after some time to get all the product out because, although the shape is cute, the wand won&#x27;t reach it all. Recently I heard from someone that they are changing the primer so it will be in a squeezable container, which will vastly improve the product. The bottle also had some leak issues. Along the bottom, the primer would ooze out. I&#x27;ve heard that this is relatively rare, but I was upset that I lost some of this expensive product. I solved the problem by applying clear nail polish along the base. I will buy this product again unless I can find another primer that works just as well and for a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: does what it is supposed to do, keeps my eyeshadow lasting for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: issues with the bottle, the price is pretty steep</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion is the first thing I put on my eyes every day.  I love the way it sets my liner and shadow, PLUS I brush it onto my eyelashes and get thicker, sexier lashes when I put my mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the fact that it neutralizes any odd coloring in my eyelids before I apply my shadow.  I am assured that I am getting the true color of my Urban Decay shadow without the under hues of my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing bonus is that the primer makes my shadow and liner last ALL DAY!  I have never had a primer do the job that this does.  I am on my fourth tube, and my daughters are both on their second.  It&#x27;s not just for the older set.  Teens love to have their hard work last the entire day long too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong here, but this brand just didnt work, the packaging was horrible! It truly was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i use it everyday... the service from you all was fantastic, quick and great handling thanks ill order from u more often keep up the good work</li>
            <li> This product is seriously amazing now after I tried it I can&#x27;t go a day without using it especially for school</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB and honestly one of the best primers out there, but UDPP has to DUMBEST packaging possible - I plan to open it up and depot it. I did buy the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; size which is a squeeze tube but am bummed to find out that much of the product is wasted due to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that some ladies I have talked to have found it takes a little while to find the right amount that works for you. I use a lot . . . while others use a little. I dab dab it to blend it and then let it set for about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Product went on very easy...Has to be put on very light...I noticed if it didn&#x27;t it made my eye&#x27;s droopy...I&#x27;m 35 so putting on a product that makes me older isn&#x27;t something I like.  I have 3 Urban Decay primers...Love them all!!  Just go light...Splurg on your primer, go cheep on eyeshadow... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wear low-end eyeshadows, and they melt before I can even get out the door for work, but this stuff helps keep my shadows on longer.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!  Makes my eye shadow last all day-through sweating, classes, parties, whatever-on my oily skin.  Well worth the money, and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> the primer was brand new as stated and of great quality. The primer last well together with the eye shadow..</li>
            <li> i never use eyeshadow without using this primer first! i touch my eyes a lot and before i discovered primer, my eyeshadow would always fade and rub off halfway through the day. it really frustrated me and so after so research i purchased this primer. i am so happy i did! my eyeshadow stays on all day now, even though i touch my eye area a ton throughout the day. it&#x27;s such a great product and definitely worth the money!! i would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Best primer ever! I do make up as a hobby for wedding, senior pictures, and sweet 16&#x27;s/15&#x27;s birthdays and I am always very happy with how true the color of the shadow turns out over this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this stuff when I ordered it. I have very oily skin and most products do not work. This one though, has kept my eyeshadow in place, all day. I can get through my entire work day and my eye makeup still looks good. I will be buying more of this. And a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY oily! I use this every day and I have not experienced any cracking or creasing with the eyeshadows. I use wal mart and MAC products. It definitely makes the colors pop. I do advise to get this product. I am African American and the color does blend well. I apply  with the brush and use my finger to blot it evenly over my eye.</li>
            <li> Eyelids may constitute a small square footage of your epidermis, but they have oil glands, too; just try touching them at the end of the day and you might feel how greasy they can be. And if you are female who wears eyeshadow, you&#x27;ll find that (a) your eyeshadow color fades, (b) your eyeshadow clumps unattractively in the creases, or both.  That&#x27;s where this eyeshadow primer by Urban Decay comes into play.  You apply some of this pinkish stuff over your eyelid and even up to your eyebrows, let it dry (it dries clear) and then you&#x27;re ready to apply makeup.    For the record, this works and prevents my lids from turning into a greasy pit by the end of a normal work day.  Every now and then, I notice a bit of shadow aggregating in the crease, but the amount is much less than what I find it I do not use the primer.  So yes, this works.    Now...a few caveats: I would not necessarily insist this to be a makeup toolbox \\&quot;must have.\\&quot;  The main reason is I feel, deep down in my most-frugal of hearts, that there has to be a lower cost alternative- if not a drugstore brand, then some other product that can double as a primer (though one should hesitate to put untested things on or near the delicate skin around the eyes).    The second caveat is a flaw in the package design.  The primer tube is a bit larger than a full sized tube of mascara, and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; is a stick with a sponge.  Without being too graphic, you can plunge all you want in the tube but the wand could not reach the product clinging to the walls.  In fact, if you cut the tube open, you would see just how much product is wasted.  Now, the powers that be at Urban Decay have redesigned the wand so it is bent at an angle- yay!- so that might help things a bit.  Still, though, for the price, you&#x27;d like to be able to get the most mileage from the product.</li>
            <li> It does do the trick of keeping the makeup on, just not as long as I was expecting it to.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily eyelids, so no matter what, make-up always sort of melt off of them after about 3 or 4 hours. It would gather in the crease and I would end up with a gross line. I hated it, so I decided to give this a try. I can honestly say that it has changed my life when it comes to make-up! Unless I&#x27;m working out and sweating a lot, this product practically eliminates the melt away and the line. My eye shadow stays put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some said that it dried out their eyelids, but those people probably don&#x27;t need to be using it anyway because it&#x27;s made for oily skin... I have super sensitive skin, but have never had any type of reaction while using it. A very little bit goes a long way too. I can swipe both lids without re-dunking the applicator and that works just fine for me. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advice of a friend and after the first time using it, I am officially in love!  Absolutely no creasing of my eyeshadow and eyeshadow in general looks so much more vibrant.  It last all day and I will never go without this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Urban Decay Primer Potion for my eye make up for about 3 years now. It does the job flawlessly. I was just extremely excited to find it at half the cost of Ulta.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most perfect product in the world.... it&#x27;s the best, it helps to shadows to shine.... I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype or the money. There are better primers out there, even their other eyeshadow primers do a better job than this watery one.</li>
            <li> I tend to be out and about for 16 hours straight some days and by the end of the day my eye shadow looks terrible if it&#x27;s still on at all. I got a free sample of this from Sephora and the first time I tried it I was blown away. My eye shadow stayed in place all day and didn&#x27;t fade at all. This stuff does exactly what you need it to but there are a couple of drawbacks you should prepare yourself for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My eye shadow goes on a lot darker/stronger than it did before I started using this and stays that way all day. I put on this primer then put on eye shadow I&#x27;ve used a million times and got several comments from people saying I looked like I was giving them an angry look because my eye shadow was much more dramatic than usual. Be prepared to tone it down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a little bit hard to wash off. I shower at night and remove my make up in there, but with this stuff I have to wipe several times with tissues after I get out to get all of the eyeshadow off. So be prepared for that and don&#x27;t end up like me waking up the next morning with eye shadow panda eyes because I didn&#x27;t look in the mirror to see it was still all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this stuff is great. I can be up and running for 16 hours straight and by the end of the day my eye shadow looks like it did when I first put it on. No creasing or fading at all!</li>
            <li> This product works well to hold eye make up on all day, but if your eyelids are wrinkly, the eye make up will magnify the wrinkles. So, be careful with the eye shadow and eye liner if it is shiny or sparkly, this product ail show all the imperfections on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the money! I never was able to wear eyeshadow before because it would always rub off a few hours after putting it on but with this I wear eyeshadow everyday and it&#x27;s stays on the entire day. I love it and will never use any other product!</li>
            <li> I had been hesitating for a long time on buying this item and I finally broke down...so worth the money! I tried it for the first time today and I will be wearing makeup more often mainly because of this item. I want to get the Sin color next!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  My eyeshadow never creases and it lasts well into the night and the next morning (you know ... for those times you *GASP* forget to wash your face before bed?).</li>
            <li> After years of having my eye makeup only last 3 or 4 hours before it smeared and creased, I had my doubts that a primer would make much of a difference. After using it once, I have rekindled my love of eye makeup. My shadow lasts all day, until I take it off with eye makeup remover (water doesn&#x27;t even faze it). This is definitely a great product that I have recommended to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The original UD eyeshadow primer potion is fantastic. I have very oily skin, and without this primer within a few hours my eyeshadow is creased and running off my face. Making it worse, my eyes will burn due to the lid oils running into my eyes. In the past four years of using this product, I have not once had this problem. This product is far superior to Mary Kay, Laura Mercier, and other eyeshadow primers in my experience.     However, the other colors (Sin, Eden) do NOT work as well as the original.    The only flaw with this product is the packaging. There are many videos on YouTube on how to get most of the product out of the package. Stupid package. I bought the tube version, and the first time I used it, the end of the tube burst and much of the product oozed out. Fortunately I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer that I have ever used. Before I found this one, I&#x27;ve always gotten creases with every other primer. I&#x27;ve even had it last through a humid day and when I got home, my makeup looked exactly as it did when I first applied it. I love love love it and would reccommend it to anyone who inquires about a good eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you enough good things about this product - it&#x27;s an absolute must-have for women (and some adventurous men!). For example, I walk 3 miles to and from work every day in a fairly humid climate, and when I take my eye makeup off at night, it still looks like I JUST put it on. Another example: last night I fell asleep with my makeup still on; when I woke up, my eye makeup was still flawless, even after applying it 24 hours earlier, and sleeping on it! I think that the problems that some people are having is that they are GLOPPING it on their eyelids. You have to put on a really small amount, smooth it out, let it dry for a few seconds, and THEN keep on going with your eyeshadow/eyeliner, etc. That&#x27;s another really great thing - because you need so little, each bottle will last you quite a long time, making the $25 price tag not nearly as painful.</li>
            <li> Works well but it works differently with each person for example, I first tried a tiny amount and that stuff creased in like an hour and I was mad and wanted to return this $20 bottle of mistake, but then I decided to try it once more but this time I used a lot more, and it work superbly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the lame bottle! Its awkward and annoying, and that is why I took away a star (yes its that annoying and plus I am a guy so it looks to girly).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I listened to some of the reviews on this product.  Not at all what I expected and won&#x27;t reorder.  Useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen positive reviews on YouTube, but I didn&#x27;t know if it would be that dramatic - since I&#x27;m &amp;#34;past my prime&amp;#34;.  I love the way it makes my eye shadow stay in place, even in the summer heat.  Highly recommend for any age.</li>
            <li> This primer would run in the eyes after getting all your makeup on.  I am  56 yo and have tried many,many primers.  This one does not even come close to Too Faced.</li>
            <li> I wear heavy, very black eyeliner.  I got so sick of it ending up in my crease.  I tried some other eyeshadow primers and they didn&#x27;t help at all.  This stuff is awesome.  It keeps my black eyeliner where it belongs.  It dries totally invisible.  Love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I loved this primer for the first year I used it. Unfortunately, my skin has changed some and my lids went from dry and flakey to oily. This potion doesn&#x27;t really work to prevent creasing with oily lids. But it worked great in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this primer, but one thing. It goes on super thick! I have to not use the wand and rub it on with my finger instead..</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants their eyeshadow to look great and stay on for a long time, I suggest you buy this!!! I work in a hot enviroment and my shadow always looks great! No creasing either which is a big plus!!! Makes the color of your shadow show up really good as well!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you need me to say this, but LOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT. I&#x27;ve always had pretty slick eyelids that would always make even the best eyeshadows just disappear in a matter of minutes. Not with this primer! It works and makes colors richer and last longer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does as the product claims, lasts all day and makes eyeshadows pop. I&#x27;ve always been looking for a product that would not have my makeup come off within 2-3 hours of the day. My makeup can last a full 14+ hours with this :)</li>
            <li> OK. So after hearing all the reviews and watching all the videos about this primer I was convinced to try it. OMG! was I so disappointed. I am not a high end makeup buyer by any means. I prefer mac paint pots over this product. My first issue is that it goes on oily. I have oily skin and eyelids. I will never try this again. Thumbs Down Urban Decay for this primer. I do love there powder foundation in fantasy.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I realized why my eyeshadow was not stayinh on.&lt;br /&gt;After being turned on to this Primer I don&#x27;t worry avbout checking my make-up&lt;br /&gt;during the day.</li>
            <li> I like urban decay but I really don&#x27;t see the difference between this primer and any other brand. I use nyx high definition primer and it cost me only 7 dollars vs this at almost $20. It works just the same at half the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you need brand names or like to waste your money...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye makeup primers, but this one actually does what it promises-crease-free, smudge-free, all day long until you take your makeup off with remover.  You only need to use a little bit, and make sure to let it dry completely before applying eye shadow and liner.  The results will be smooth, streak-free,and crease free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really hard for me to find a primer that actually works for my Italian oily eyelids and this does absolutely everything it&#x27;s supposed to! I will never switch to another brand ever again!</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this, I don&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t cover the imperfections (like veins) on my lids like other primers do.  It doesn&#x27;t make the color more vibrant and it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does with any other primer, even the really cheap ones that come in the eyeshadow trio</li>
            <li> The top broke off the second week I got it and there&#x27;s no way to return it.  It&#x27;s like a brush that comes off (like a lipgloss), and if the top breaks, it just dries up inside.</li>
            <li> I finally tried the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, and I really liked it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and blend, and it makes my eyeshadow look vibrant and stay put throughout the day. The only issue I have with Urban Decay&#x27;s primer is that I don&#x27;t think one bottle lasts nearly as long as the Too Faced tube does. The Urban Decay primer comes in a cute bottle, but I feel like you don&#x27;t get as much product as you do with Too Faced. For that reason, I likely won&#x27;t repurchase this brand, but it definitely works great...I&#x27;d just prefer to get more bang for my buck with Too Faced&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I never used eyeshadow primers before so my eyeshadow/eyeliner would always fade off or run after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;But after using urban decay primer potion (which feel so creamy and smooth and lovely!) my eyeshadow and liner lasted way longer.&lt;br /&gt;Application became easier and the purple eyeshadow look I was wearing was a lot more noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 12+ hours with crease-free lids that looked as fresh as when I first applied my shadow. Will never go out without priming with this first. Primer will keep a thick layer of shadow in perfect place, never looses shimmer. It even makes your eyeshadows brighter and truer in color.</li>
            <li> So...I saw the bad reviews on this product and thought \\&quot;OMG I&#x27;M GOING TO WASTE MY MONEY\\&quot;. But for some reason I decided to buy it anyway because I had been using Revlon creme eye shadow as a primer/base and that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. The product is very pricey but hey, so is the price of beauty lol. Shipping was fast, the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best though. Looked kind of cheap to me but that was the least of my worries. I needed to try it and see if it worked! I applied it to my eyes and it went on so smoothly, it was like velvet. I applied my eye shadow and they didnt come out as bright as I expected them to but maybe that was because I didnt use a base. You should probably use a base with the primer to make the colors pop more. I have been wearing this eye make up for 10 hours and counting and I have not gotten a crease. There is no \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; look and it looks like it did when I first applied it. URBAN DECAY PRIMER POTION IS THE BUSINESS!!!! I LOVE IT AND IT WORKS ON MY OILY SKIN. BOTTOM LINE: GET IT NOW!</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!! Once you use this primer you&#x27;ll be hooked! I apply this under my eyeshadow and I&#x27;m not kidding when I say my eyeshadow looks perfect until I wash my face. I can go to sleep with my makeup on and wake up and its still perfect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. A friend of mine recommended it to me and its great. My eyes look great, no creases, and make up lasts all night long. Best primer ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer for $24 which is automatically a ripoff.  I have only used it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m pretty much out of it already.  The quality itself is below average.  I have read a lot of reviews saying that it is an amazing product and that it does not fade, and with my oily skin I thought it would be perfect, but its not as amazing as its all cracked up to be.  I mean, yes it does work, but not for as long as I feel like it should.  Mine will last for about five hours before it starts to fade away, and when it does start to fade it becomes all blotchy.  Save your money and get a different primer.</li>
            <li> I always wondered why my eccentric eyeshadows never really truly &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; the color i was applying. this did the job.  Just a thin layer of it underneath my eye shadow and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back and I&#x27;ve only used it twice for special occasions that were long. I heard of this product through Michelle Phan on youtube and I wanted to try it. This product really does work! It lasts for a long time. It makes your eyeshadows/eye makeup stay in place for a long time without smudging or caking. It goes on before you put on your eyeshadow. But to warn you, only use a little dab on each eye. If you use too much, it will be hard to rub the eye makeup off later. If you&#x27;re looking for a eye primer that will make your eyemakeup last through out the whole day and night, this would be the product for you. Also perfect for ladies who go out clubbing the whole night too.     The only downside is that it was expensive for a product that is the size of your mascara bottle. Also it really does stay on, so when you try to clean your eye makeup before going to bed, you have to rub it hard to make it come off. That hurted. Maybe if I had an eye makeup remover, it would have been easier, hahaha! But overall it kept my eye makeup on throughout my whole occasion, without smudging or caking.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow primer makes your eyeshadow look just as rich on your eyes as it is on the palette, and it makes it stay on ALL day. I literally have washed my face and scrubbed my eyes with a towel, and my eyeshadow is still on. The only way to get it completely off is to use eye makeup remover or some sort of oil-based solvent (like baby oil or lotion). I honestly can never go back to doing my makeup without it. It makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The best eyeshadow primer that has been created. Love it, been using for years</li>
            <li> Never used eyeshadow primer before and thought I&#x27;d give this a try, being a fan of Urban Decay product and all. Was not disappointed, eyeshadow stayed on all day without creasing and stayed just as vibrant as when I applied it, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is just perfect. It makes eyeshadow application much smoother and gives an all day lasting look.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product my shadow would fade into my skin by mid-day. With this product it looks fresh until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> I used Bobbi Brown longwear eyeshadow, its excellent. the only thing that has ever stayed on my eyelids.  But on days that I don&#x27;t want to wear a shadow, just an eyeliner and mascara I was at a loss.  I need the Bobbi Brown long wear eyeshadow to keep my eyeliner on.  I thought I would give this a try.  It goes on globby and looks globby even if you try to smooth it out with your finger.  Horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> I had used the sample size of this product before. I did not want to pay full price at a makeup store. Amazon&#x27;s listed price is 20% lower. My eye shadow lasts all day with just a light coat of this in the morning.</li>
            <li> this is a truly great product but the applicator broke after about 3 weeks really disappointed about the turn out of this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this stuff keeps my eyeshadow from smearing, creasing, running or flaking.  I used it under my makeup for a wedding, and my eye makeup looked as good at 1am as it did at 1pm.  It goes on very smooth (not too thick, sticky, or dry, like the Bare Minerals shadow primers), and is basically invisible under all of my eyeshadows, even the nude/neutral colors.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this primer relatively fast in great packaging. As far as the product itself goes? It goes on great, colors blend really well [even cheap ones. I&#x27;m wearing $3 Hot Topic eyeshadows over it for testing right now and they look spectacular] and of course higher end ones work great as well.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is nice, blends out and dries fast - almost instantly. The only downfall is I thought the bottle would be a litttttttle bit bigger but that&#x27;s my own fault, thinking 10ml/.34oz would be more but it&#x27;s still quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again and I can&#x27;t see myself going back to other primers.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a way to make your eye shadow last all day, look no further than Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion.  This product helps eye shadow glide on smoothly and stay on without creasing.  By the end of the day your eye shadow will look almost as good as when you put it on that morning.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the packaging.  Even though it&#x27;s super cute, it ends up leaving quite a bit of product in the bottle, which gets wasted.  I saw they came out with a new tube version though, which I&#x27;m looking forward to trying.  Definitely recommend this product in both the Original (which is a translucent color with a matte finish) as well as the Sin (which is a very pretty neutral color in a shimmery finish).</li>
            <li> shadow on my eyelids very bad stay, roll over about 20 minutes. From this base, I can walk all day made ​​up, nothing adjusting. But can dry the skin dry for centuries! keep in mind ..</li>
            <li> Almost too good! I apply the primer in the morning and my eye makeup lasts all day. You definitely need make-up remover to remove the remainder of the makeup/primer at night.    Update 1/2/15 - I purchased the primer in \\&quot;sin\\&quot; this time around and do not like it as much. Urban decay changed the packaging so it comes in a squeeze tube now so you must apply with your fingers. This can make application very messy. I also do not think that it works as well or lasts as long. With the original product my eye shadow did not budge at all. Now, my eye shadow may disappear by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Awesome primer! I just it around my eyebrows because I use powder to fill them in and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you are in an environment where your eyeshadow has a tendency to fade throughout the day, this primer helps it to stick without clumping which ultimately allows you better coverage with a lot less usage.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely love this potion. Urban Decay didn&#x27;t name this potion for nothing, it really does it job. Goes on smooth, easy to apply and must have for all ladies out there.</li>
            <li> I love Urban Decay -- especially their 24/7 eye pencils.  I have many of their eye kits, and always get a primer potion deluxe sample with the kit. I have like five of these floating around in the various shades.     I do not like this primer at all, and here&#x27;s why:    1) The jar it comes in is an awkward shape, and the bunny foot applicator can not possibly get to all the product. The company responded to this by tilting the bunny foot so that it reaches the sides of the container, but since the container is not clear, there is no way to tell if you are really getting all the product. If you cut open the container, or microwave and pour out contents (YouTube has instructions on both), you can see a lot of unused product remaining.     2) The potion sometimes makes my eyelids sting, and I do NOT have sensitive skin.     3) The potion does not prime properly, the way other eye primers do. It is too thin a layer and does absolutely nothing to improve eye makeup application or extend the wearability of eye makeup.    I always come back to this primer in between other primers, but I have never been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a sample with a palette I bought. I loved it from first use. It keeps eyeshadow on and vibrant until I want to take it off at night. It really makes the color of the shadow more vibrant and crease proof. I have very oily lids and this helped tremendously with keeping my shadow where it should be. I recommend this to anyone who wants their shadow to stay well, not crease and look vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeshadow primer! When I run out, I turn right around and buy it again and again.  I use no other brand of primer.</li>
            <li> Never reapply eye shadow during the day.  This stuff is great.  Keeps my eyeliner in place and my eye shadow on all day.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this urban decay eyeshadow primer potion yesterday 8/30/11 it arrived with a quickness today 8/31/11. I was so excited! I&#x27;m confussed as to why is it without packaging? it has tiny scratches to it...and whn I opened it. it looks as if it were used??? I think I paid too much for this for it to be in this condition.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for someone special. Her thoughts on the primer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This is my GO-TO primer!  It keeps your eye shadow from creasing, it stays on for a long time (even while I&#x27;m sleeping).  It makes eye shadows more vibrant.  It&#x27;s just the business, I&#x27;ll never wear shadow without this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t get all of the primer out of the tube with the wand, I would have preferred a squeeze tube.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have greasy eyelids anymore.  All of my eye shadow was a small little line by the end of the day, not anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Mixed with NYX Eyeshadow primer- ur eyeshadow wont crease or move for that matter.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eyeshadow base after reading such great reviews and I have to say it lived up to the hype. The only reason I am not giving this a five star rating is that after dropping it in the bathroom sink once the bottom edge chipped and part of it broke off exposing the primer. This bottle is made of really thin, brittle plastic... not ideal for this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging isnt the best but hey, the product is wonderful! It makes your eyeshadow pop and creasing almost never occurs. Definetly a great purchase!</li>
            <li> i dont have any other words but perfect. works like a dream. my make up last all day. its great.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow is cheap stuff from the beauty supply.  It fades and goes away.  With this primer, it looks fresh and can be as intense as you want it to all day.  People were jealous at the wedding I went to because I had this beautiful turquoise eyeshadow with my turquoise dress.  Cheap, cheap pots of glitter eyeshadow for 4 bucks with this primer, and it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this on Amazon, but from Sephora. If I pay as much as I&#x27;m willing to pay from such a store, I expect something great. This product did not live up to that standard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a review on here from someone who said that the product made her look like an old lady. This was my experience too! In fact, I wish I had thought of it in that way. Like her, this stuff made my eyeshadow look cracked and cakey. It was as if the makeup I used after application was going over extreme wrinkled, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expensive as it was, I threw this in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could figure out why so many people love this, but . . . just no!</li>
            <li> Its perfect it truly is the best primer out there, eyeshadow stays for hours and it looks beautifulyour eyeshadow will not smear.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item authentic, a lil primer goes a long way or it will crease, brings out the color in eyeshadows n stays on till u wash it off! Very happy!</li>
            <li> best eye product out there you can buy!  and got the item in 3 days! can&#x27;t beat that at all!</li>
            <li> I was happy when i got this in the mail but when i first tried i noticed that its very oily.</li>
            <li> makes the eye shadow pop! works excellent, so beautifull... the purple paint peel off, now mine is white.</li>
            <li> This works so good that my eyeshadows even show kinda true colors that they have never shown before applying this! The primer itself has a nude color so will not effect the look at all. RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> This eye primer works wonderful. My daughter bought it and liked it so I got some and liked it. It seemed the perfect stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I have very oily skin and I avoided wearing eye makeup because it would crease and look awful.  Now, I use just a little bit of UD and it&#x27;s great!  It is expensive, but it is worth it!  I tried a less costly product, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s De-crease and it didn&#x27;t hold up for 8 hours.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love this eye primer.  It helps keep my eye make up on all day.  I only wish the container would last longer!</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely matter, but it came with no packaging and unsealed. It could be a half-used tube for all I know. I am hestitant to use it since it wasn&#x27;t sealed. I was very disappointed and will never order makeup online again.</li>
            <li> I order this because it was cheap, and I wanted to try Urban Decay products. Now I will buy other Urban decay products.This is a pretty good primer.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends house and could not wait to order my own. It really makes the eyeshadow last longer and never smears</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I always had trouble with my eyeshadow lasting, creasing, ending up all over my face. I always assumed it was crappy eyeshadow but its because my lids are too oily. This stuff is perfect! I use it everytime and it never fails. I wish they came in much larger tubes. I ordered the Professional Size this time :)</li>
            <li> I love this product soooo much! worth every penny! Went to sleep with makeup on woke up and it looked like I had just done my makeup. My friend has the same product in Eden. She went swimming and her  makeup still looked great! It didn&#x27;t smear or anything!</li>
            <li> Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion is a legend, and rightfully so.  No, it&#x27;s not overrated.  It&#x27;s worth every single penny, and if you own expensive eyeshadows and don&#x27;t wear a good primer, then you are totally wasting money.  Good make-up is wasted without a great primer, which is this.  It makes your eyeshadows go on well and POP, and STAY ON.  Urban Decay is the best I have ever tried.  Too Faced primer is also very popular, but I prefer this one.  I would recommend trying to get the newer version of this though - the one in the tube.  The wand is kind of annoying and I feel like it&#x27;s wasteful.  Beisdes that, this is a must-have in your make-up collection.</li>
            <li> nothing personal against this person trying to make a dollar....but i do think thats too much for the primer...it comes with the naked urban decay eye shadow set granted you pay 50 dollars but still you get it for free...and even if you want it by itself you can most likely get it for cheaper than how much this person wants....so if you guys have any brains what so ever i wouldnt buy it from this person they&#x27;re just trying to rip you off</li>
            <li> Best primer ive ever used. doesnt crease or stay tacky. makes shadows, liners, and mascara stay bright and un-smudged all day. i use it all over my eye without irritation. obv. try not to get it IN your eye. lol UD seems to be pretty top notch. woth the extra $$$</li>
            <li> It worked really well. Unfortunately, I dropped it one day and it cracked. I probably wasted half of it because it just dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Upon buying one at Macy&#x27;s, I did a little comparison and I am not sure if it is authentic Urban Decay. Nonetheless, the half of what I utilized worked great. However, if it isn&#x27;t authentic, I don&#x27;t know how safe it is on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this item and I am still very satisfied with it.  The primer dries clear and is really good for keeping make-up on if you&#x27;re going to be out of the house for most of the day.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy into makeup (I&#x27;m not that girl at the gym, at least) but I definitely try to leave the house with a full face done. So while I&#x27;m not using this for bright, super chic colors, I&#x27;ve used it with a pretty wide spectrum of looks and it&#x27;s been consistently great. I can see how people think it dries their eyelids out, that&#x27;s a good thing for me, but be aware of that in case you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**ALSO when I first read reviews for this, I knew about the genie bottle vs. tube styles, and knew this one was going to be the bottle, aaand I had read about the whole cutting the tube and depotting (I knew I wasn&#x27;t ever going to do that, but I was aware that was an option and it saved a LOT of otherwise wasted product). Oddly enough, even with the extensive reviews I&#x27;d skimmed on multiple websites, I&#x27;d never caught the secret about removing the little plastic insert at the top of the bottle once you&#x27;re completely out of primer. Instead of cutting the tube, use a pin or thin tweezers to pop the insert at the applicator opening out, and you can get the rest of the product out! The insert is used to remove the excess product from the wand, the way lip glosses do the same thing so it doesn&#x27;t all come out in globs at once. Thanks to Girlfit from Makeupalley for the hint (and I&#x27;m sure countless other people)</li>
            <li> After a 12 hour day my shadow still looks like I just put it on. It isint heavy or oily and doesnt cake up. Great product and I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> My fiance asked me to order this and she said it was a great product. She looked great for some photos we took.</li>
            <li> ordered this along with eye shadows, the liner works perfectly to keep the shadow in place, my eyes would water if I didn&#x27;t use any primer,  this stops the watering, love it</li>
            <li> It is a good primer but I don&#x27;t like the application stick, it gets on my eyelashes and makes them look blonde! If you want to take the time to dab the primer onto an eyeshadow brush and then apply it works great.</li>
            <li> This was great eye primer my shadow last most of the day and no crease in my eye lids :)</li>
            <li> I used this product before. It is very nice, and i think i will stick to it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The best eye shadow primer I have ever used. The eye shadow does not crease, stays on all day long. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow stayed on for 2 days if you want long lasting wear from your eyeshadow use this product best I ever used</li>
            <li> I avoided this stuff for years because  I thought it was all hype and overly-promoted on YouTube... and I was right. I won&#x27;t deny that it forms a good base for eyeshadow. But what you have to be careful of is that your eyeshadow covers the ENTIRE primer base. The texture of the primer is such that it dries into a solid like a facial masque or Halloween latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can FEEL that it&#x27;s there. You can SEE that it&#x27;s there. You&#x27;d better hope that you don&#x27;t have any crow&#x27;s feet, because it will only make them look crepe-y and more intensified. It magnifies the color of your foundation at the edges of your eyes in the same way it magnifies the color of your eyeshadow. You&#x27;ll see a clear delineation between the edge of the primer and the edge of your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the word &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; is a misnomer for this product. An eyeshadow base it is, and an excellent one at that. But for anyone who wears foundation, you&#x27;ve got to be so careful with this stuff that it&#x27;s really not worth it. I prefer just using and setting a BB cream on my eyelids. My eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go anywhere when I use a BB cream. This is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really worth the price, but it definitely make my eye liner go on a lot easier!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Urban Decay and this primer potion, but this particular bottle...i&#x27;m not sure if this is the REAL thing. It seems a bit watered down compared to what I&#x27;m used to. However, it does keep the eyeshadow on all day which is the purpose but I still don&#x27;t like the fact that I may have spent damn near 20.00 on a knock off.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer i have ever used on my eyes i! it  keeps the shadow on all day. Helps blend colors smoothly and it came 4 days than it was suppose to overall i love this product and will repurchase and recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeshadow primers.  I tried this one because it was reasonably priced and available on Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It is by far the best primer I&#x27;ve tried.  No creases after 10 hours of wear - awesome!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. It goes on easily and covers well - makes a great base for eye shadow. My only negative - which keeps it from being five stars - is that I find the bent applicator difficult to use. I would prefer a tube with the ability to just squeeze out the right amount.</li>
            <li> Living in the tropics and participating in an outdoor sport does a number on a girl&#x27;s eye makeup, and I needed something to prevent the shadow creases.  This is it.  I am always skeptical about new products at first, but I have to say this one does not disappoint.  I did learn that it works best if I wait up to 5 min. before applying my shadow - but no longer than that.  Also, I wear contact lenses and have had no problems in that respect.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I was really, truly amazed with this product.  I have dry skin, but my eyes are watery/oily. So within about an hour my makeup is running and creasing.  But with this primer (which I have read is one of the best) my makeup stays on all day. After about 4-5 hours I notice a little creasing, but its only noticable i you look really close.  PLUS, it makes eyeshadow so much more vibrant! I found out the hard way that with this primer, you dont have to coat on as much eyeshadow as you would without it.  I highly recommend this product for ALL women. It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never really used primer until I bought Mary Kay. But I didn&#x27;t really think it worked, so I just decided not to use the product. However, recently I have been following a makeup artist who uses this product and so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And it was suppose to take a while to ship and I got it in less than a week! Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Smith</li>
            <li> This keeps my eye shadow try to color this is a must when applying eye shadows! love it! My daughter purchased this but, payed way to much at the mall!</li>
            <li> I had read reviews about this primer in a magazine and I think it lives up to its reputation.  It seems to keep my eye make-up in perfect condition all day long.</li>
            <li> I wanted an eyeshadow primer and this one is great! Easy to apply and it makes your eyeshadow stay. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best eyeshadow primer I have ever tried. As a makeup artist I think that says a whole lot. I consider primers a necessity.</li>
            <li> This is an above average product though it is a little drying. It does do what it&#x27;s suppsed to... However, the packaging is AWFUL! Looks cheap, leaks, product dries around the screw cuff, ugly colored bottle, tacky design... I&#x27;m sticking to Nars primer from now on. I cannot reward such awful packaging with my money. This product isn&#x27;t cheap for what it is. Sorry Urban Decay. I love your Naked pallettes but I will not be buying this primer anymore.</li>
            <li> A product that delivers.  This is the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Tried others and none worked.  Love the wand applicator.</li>
            <li> This made a wonderful stocking stuffer. This primer will keep your eyeshadow on all day and night. This is the only primer I have found that does this. Urban Decay is a wonderful brand.</li>
            <li> This primer is one of the best for shadow to stay put all day long. It is sheer and very light... does not add any bulk or weigh down your eyes at all.  I took off a star due to the dryness due to the dryness I do experience after using it consecutively.</li>
            <li> I thank my teen daughter for introducing me to a terrific eye shadow primer.  Keeps it all looking good through activity, even heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primer.  My eye shadow stays all day without a worry.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Urban Decay eyeshadow and primer and finds that this works the best.  My daughter would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> its a great primer  it keeps my  eye shadow  my make up stays on  looks as fresh  just a great products</li>
            <li> You will need to know how much to add and how long to wait before you apply your eyeshadow but this is great product</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the great reviews for this product--but it works great!  I love having my eyeshadow stay on where I put it all day long and it doesn&#x27;t fade!  I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> First, the product is AMAZING!! I don&#x27;t know how what&#x27;s in it, but it WORKS! You just put it on your eyelids BEFORE your shadow, like a basecoat, then apply your shadow...and BOOM! it lasts for a looooooong time. like at least 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that it is harder to blend when using this. I normally like to use just two colors a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; darker color, and a lighter \\&quot;highligter\\&quot; type of color. And I like to sort of blend/fade the darker one sort of in an ombre type way. But this makes that fading-to-light blending process difficult. You can use a VERY light hand on the fade-ier sections, or just a lighter color (which I feel works better.) I don&#x27;t fault the product for this, I mean it is DESIGNED to grab your shadow afterall! It is just in my application method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer the same [[ASIN:B004S9TYH4 Urban Decay Primer that comes in a tube.]] It seems that spongy applicator is a little gloppy for me and I always end up smearing it around correctly with my finger anyway. Plus, no applicator to get dirty! I used to like the straight applicator they had, but you could never get all the product out of the container. The newer angled one here helps that, but I always bang it on my eyelashes or get a clump at the tip which ends up on my eyelid (which needs to be smeared with my finger!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do mascara FIRST! If you blink or sneeze and get a spot of mascara on your primed eyelids, you have to start ALL over...you aren&#x27;t wiping that black speck away with this primer! Let it DRY! (I usually do foundation while I wait the minute or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the primer. With the wand, I usually aim for the crease of my eye and blend the still-wet primer around with my fingertip. You can use the wand once the tube gets emptier, but a newer tube will have too much product on it to wipe around. Put it anywhere you put shadow (I go all the way to eyebrow.) TIP: I have indeed tried this stuff on the lower lid. My eyeliner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help. My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way. It still fades/smears. It doesn&#x27;t work well to cover blemishes, either (I have tried that, too!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!! I mean, take less than you usually do, you aren&#x27;t getting any extra off with a brush or a tissue. You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don&#x27;t want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes! If you are using those sponge-tip applicators that often come with eyeshadow, STOP!! Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control. It is too hard to see how much shadow you have on a sponge-y thing. They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!) I start with the darker color and add highlighting (like under your brow) last. You can attempt to blend, but the colors won&#x27;t move around too much. You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it. A third \\&quot;medium\\&quot; color makes the process easier to fade from dark to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Get ready to fend off suitors!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Removal: I use make-up remover (vaseline works, too) and those round cotton pads for this since I normally have waterproof mascara. I don&#x27;t use the primer all the time, usually for times when I know I have a long day or will be somewhere where it is hot (it works there too!!!)  I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don&#x27;t like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it. And I figure that oily eye-makeup remover is like an extra moisturizer!liner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help. My experience hasn&#x27;t been too effective this way. It still fades/smears. It doesn&#x27;t work well to cover blemishes, either (I have tried that, too!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!!

            <li> This is a really great product! It enables you to wear your eyeshadow all day without having to re apply!</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the brushes were as displayed in the picture on the website.  i recommend it for all make up lovers. the primer is so good. it helps the eye shadow to last longer on the eye.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product and it did not disappoint. Really does make your shadow stay brighter for longer.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this.  Its good.  Odd application but works well to keep eye shadows on for long wear. Prevents creasing of shades</li>
            <li> I used to have to fix my eye liner all the time because it would melt and smear all around my eye but this primer keeps all my eye make up in tact.</li>
            <li> It is a primer before I apply eyeshadow. It was little watery and too white. I expected it to be more solid and blend in my skin like my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product. All eye shadows claim they won&#x27;t crease on you. We all know that this is not true. Put this product on first then apply eye shadow. All day my shadow does not crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. It should be applied after your moisturizer to ensure that all make-up stays in place. This product really does keep your eye shadow from creasing, but you have to make sure you apply is under your foundation/base color. The paint on the bottle, however, started to chip off after a few months. Pretty soon, I had random purple flakes on my face from it. Eventually I tried rubbing all of the paint off from the middle, but now it looks ugly.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve tried so far and really makes your shadow last most of the day with limited creasing. Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other eyeshadow primers. The only downside is that it normally sells for $18-$20 at most makeup stores which is a little more than I like to spend on a tiny tube of primer. Luckily Amazon helps to find the lowest price, and I&#x27;ve been able to find it for a decent price at my local makeup store. Definitely try this out if you find a price you&#x27;re satisfied with!:)</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with my eyeshadow creasing. I have the double whammy: Asian eyes and oily skin. No eyeshadow has ever lasted through the day without creasing. This Primer Potion works miracles for me. My eyeshadow looks exactly the same at the end of the day as it did when I applied it. It&#x27;s amazing! It also makes the shadow go on smoothly and more intensely. I am now able to use even cheap eyeshadow with great results. I put a tiny smear of the potion on each lid then gently smooth it over my skin. Then I let it sit for a minute or two (while I fill in my brows) before applying eyeshadow. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, you should. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love UD&#x27;s primer potion, the only problem I have is that it was starting to dry out after a while (over a year) so I tried to heat it in the microwave to get the liquid flowing better.  I left it in too long (30 secs) and it melted the whole container.  That was totally my fault so I haven&#x27;t docked any stars for it, just a warning for those who try this method.  Use 2 or 3 secs at a time and check it after each one.</li>
            <li> Helps eyeshadow to stay on very well, and is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to stalwart makeup users.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really argue with all the reviews here.  Primer potion is truly an amazing eye primer by Urban Decay.  It is definitely a must in every girl&#x27;s cosmetic bag.  Word of caution however, this primer tends to dry eye lids a bit. So in the winter I always use eye cream before applying the primer.  And in the summer this base is absolutely indispensable.  In the sweltering heat my lids get really oily and without this magical primer I could say \\&quot;bye, bye\\&quot; to a decent eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say that it&#x27;s a lot of money to spend for primer. However trust me this small tube will last a very long time. Very little of this stuff goes a long way.  I really just use tiny amount that I apply with the applicator on my lid and spread with the tip of my finger.  Granted this tube is not very convenient in terms of getting out every last drop.  However to remedy this all you need to do is watch a few videos on youtube that describe how to properly cut up the package and save every last drop of this amazing primer. 100% recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First of all the product came 2 weeks later than suggested, when i asked the company about it all I got was a copy of a shipping order and that it was out of their hands. Second of all i was sent a whole other product, the eyeshadow primer i was sent came in a gold bottle with a purple lid and was not white like this one is. Instead it was a GOLD base, i attempted to make this worth for the eye shadow i was doing for a pageant but the gold color was so pigmented it shown brightly through any eyeshadow then would not come off even with makeup wipes. Very disappointing overall. I would have sent the product back but i had to use it, the product arrived the DAY BEFORE the pageant! I will not be ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and expected to recieve it the 28th sept. - Oct 5th and it was at my door on 26th of sept! So shipping was extremely quick here(I live in Texas). I&#x27;ve used the product once already and it did as decribed, helped make up stay in place longer. If there&#x27;s anything negative to say about this product, it&#x27;s the size. It&#x27;s a small bottle for an expensive price. I hope it lasts a while. It&#x27;s very light weight, so having this product in your purse won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than all that, it&#x27;s a good product, just a bit pricey for a girl like me. If money is not a problem, then it&#x27;s a great deal :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. Arrived really quickly and she swears by this! A little pricey but worth every penny. She does make up and she recommends this all the time for clients.</li>
            <li> I thought this primer would be the best that I have used because of price and reviews. I see now that it is not any better than the cheaper Elf product. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product makes your eyeshadow color pop a little more than normal and it helps it last all day. I have used other lines and different types of eyeshadow primer and this is the one that really works. I have very oily skin so I feel like normally my eye make-up melts off and this is a product that keeps that from happening.  No more oily eyeshadow in the crease of my eyes. this product makes your eyeshadow look freshly applied all day long. I did combine this with a product called model in a bottle and it made my make-up as a whole last all day going on 13hrs on a rainy humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied its not thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> This is my very first purchase from UD. Based on many youtube beauty blog&#x27;s great review, I decided to give it a try. I am asian and have almond shape eyes and crease that folds in. Usually towards the end of the day, my eye makeup accumulates in the crease which is frustrating. But after using this primer potion, my eye make up stayed on and does not crease until 8 hours during summer. I am sure it lasts longer during winter when my oil gland don&#x27;t get activated as much. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin this product probably won&#x27;t work for you.  I tried it numerous times and it makes my eye shadow crease even worse than before.  I&#x27;ve found that using foundation powder under my shadow works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  My eye shadow still creases but it takes much longer for it to do so.</li>
            <li> This primer makes a huge difference in the length of time my eyeshadow stays put! It also helps in eliminating eyeshadow creases that tend to show during the day.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to extend the wear of their eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This seems like a really good product to make eye shadow last longer with out creasing.  It does make the colors a little more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a lot of people on YouTube using it so I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hate about it is the applicator.  It doesn&#x27;t pull out a lot of product so I have to dip it lots of times.  when I put the applicator back in the bottle half the product rubs off on the lip of the bottle.  Kind of wasteful and annoying.  But I guess that is the price you pay for the cute bottle.  Over all seems like a good product I just hate the applicator.  I guess it was at least worth trying.it out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything wrond with it other then the fact that a little bit of the primer was on the outside of the bottle. Other than that, it was great, I definitely like the vintage bottle better then the new one.</li>
            <li> My primer came in the estimated time set came in a cute little package and very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> No need for a long review- this primer is fantastic! Well worth the money. Even to an eye primer virgin like me, using this stuff was a breeze. It just adds that extra level of finish to your makeup routine. If you want to look at the end of your day like you looked in the VERY beginning, buy this! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in my make up bag. Keeps eye shadow on until the next day!</li>
            <li> This keeps my eyeshadow on for hours even through sweating and oily eye lids.</li>
            <li> WOW! Really that&#x27;s all I can say about this product!  I am in love with it!  I heard bad things about eye shadow primer from a friend of mine and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this item but I am so glad now that I didn&#x27;t listen to her.  Did I mention it&#x27;s amazing!  I&#x27;m hooked for life!  Prior to using this product, I would have the eyelid shadow crease by the time lunch rolled around every day, but not anymore!  There isn&#x27;t even a tiny bit of shadow out of place by the time my 12 hour day is over.  It&#x27;s seriously amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in other reviews I haven&#x27;t had any issues with knowing how much to put on or when to put it on.  I just make sure my lid is covered and rub off any extra.  It&#x27;s really very simple!  I will be stocking up!</li>
            <li> As a Makeup Artist I knew this was going to be an amazing product already, as I have always loved Urban Decay - but the price from this seller was the best part! Definitely a lot cheaper than the department store. I will definitely be buying from this seller again. :)</li>
            <li> Love potion #9 is how I feel about Urban Decay&#x27;s Eye primer potion.&lt;br /&gt;No matter the quality of the eyeshadow I purchase I always end up with a crease an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I can wear any brand of eyeshadow for 8 hours and it looks just like it did 8 hours ago.( a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear the \\&quot;smokey eye\\&quot; look, the colors blend easily and stay blended.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought afew other eye shadow primers and have had difficulty being able to blend, stay blended, or even work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow Primer Potion to every girl, even if you don&#x27;t have trouble with your eyeshadow creasing, It&#x27;s great for making your eyeshadow last all day or night.</li>
            <li> Is amazing, eyeshadows last all day long, consistency is light and smells good. I definitely will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I just received my order this week so I&#x27;ve only used the primer twice. I only wore eyeliner one of those times. The only other eye primer that I have tried that seemed to work is Mary Kay. So far Urban Decay seems to be a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for the last couple of days and I have had no creasing from morning until night when I take it off! I have oily skin and oily eyelids so I have always had creasing. I&#x27;m loving this product so far. I hope it continues to work this good through out the summer months.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. I had heard about it through a friend and thought it was too good to be true. but it does work and it makes you eye makeup look better than before. It works a lot vetter with Urban Decays own eye make up. But the choice is yours. I loved this product and will buy more when I run out. It is a small bottle but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be the top notch primer on the make up market NOPE!  Every time I put this on my eyeshadow creases like crazy also my shadow disappear I have to reapply not good at all I do not like this primer searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> This stuff works....usually I put nothing under my eyeshadow and after a few hours it clumps in the creases of my eyelids...but with this stuff it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really looking for a good eye primer so your eyeshadow won&#x27;t crease... This is it!!  I tried it and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few primers that are less expensive and more expensive, but by far, this is the BEST primer I have ever used.  My eyeshadow looks like it did when I put it on at 8am at 8pm.  Just amazing!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought fairly expensive eye shadow a couple weeks ago and was stunned as to how much it took to replicate its brightness and boldness when applied to my eyelids! I was suggested by another review to buy this product, and although I was hesitant based on the price, I can absolutely say that it is worth it. I have to use much less eye shadow once this has been applied first and this product will save me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tilted applicator comes in very handy for those of us that do not want to contort our hands and arms just to apply eyeshadow primer. I recommend this to others looking to extend the life of their eyeshadow supply.</li>
            <li> If you want your eyeshadow to stay on, try this product!  It is so awesome and my eyeshadow stays on all day!  I will be a forever customer.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many great things about Urban Decay, usually their stuff is too expensive for me... But I decided to give in and purchase this primer and it is everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be. It went on smoothly and held my eyeshadow all day! Best primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Until I used this product, I generally needed to reapply my eye shadow mid-day, and even then it would be sunk into the creases in my eyelids in just a few hours. I used to use Chanel eyeshadow primer, thinking how could this not be the best, given its pedigree and price?? Well, I just chucked the Chanel after discovering this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing--my eyeshadow stays in place all day! Other reviewers found their makeup difficult to remove, but I used an eye makeup remover on cotton swabs, and it came off very easily. I cannot recommend this highly enough!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this. I used to have problems with my eyeshadow creasing mid-day, and now it never does. Once I even wore my eyeshadow to bed with this underneath and it hadn&#x27;t moved or creased overnight! If you have oily eyelids like me, this will really tone down the oily so eyeshadow will stay put. I use this everyday regardless of whether I wear eyeshadow because it makes my eyelids look less oily and I like the color of this primer against my skin tone. Unlike other reviewers complain, this didn&#x27;t dry out or crack my skin. Although don&#x27;t take this bottle with you anywhere-- it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I never used to use eyeshadow primer &amp; now I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s been my whole life !!! This product is absolutley amazing. Keeps my colors on all day long. Does not look creasy or clumpy. LOVE this product ♡♡</li>
            <li> I love this primer. I&#x27;ve bought several of these and they are well worth the price. It really keeps your eye shadow and eye liner on your eye throughout the entire day. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone in search of a primer!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works great, I recommend to anyone.I have oily lids and its always been hard to keep eyeshadow on but this stuff works great and last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have found &amp; tried this product &amp; am happy with the results.  My eyeshadow looks much better @ end of day when I use this product as compared to when I do not...</li>
            <li> I adore this product. I had never used primer before, but read a review about it and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. It makes my eye shadow last longer, prevents the gathering I used to get at the crease of my eye, even made it last through me wearing my makeup to Zumba or the gym and getting all sweaty (No, I don&#x27;t dress up to work out. I&#x27;m just too lazy to take it off before I go to Zumba/the gym). But the unexpected benefit and the thing I love the most is that it prevents my eyeliner from smudging. Generally, my eyeliner would smudge, lighten, and smear downward giving a bit of a light &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; throughout the day that I had to be aware of. I was constantly wiping the smeared spot off from my lower eyelids. With a little primer beneath my eye as well as on my lids, it prevents that smearing and my eyeliner looks as great at the end of the day as it does five minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! For years I battled with my oily eyelids &amp; shadow creasing, disappearing.  No more, this is a must!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, no creasing, and your vibrant color lasts all day. The only thing I&#x27;d suggest to UD would be to use a different style container. There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left inside the tube. But don&#x27;t let that minor detail sway your purchase. You will love this product.</li>
            <li> This product delivers! I had a super long work day and I put it on at 5am in the morning and came home at 11pm--my eye make up still looked fantastic. Very few products in the beauty world live up to their claims, and this does hands down. Worth every penny. I also use it sometimes without eye makeup to help with my oily eyelids. Sometimes by 6pm or so, my eyes sting a bit from my oily lids and this definitely helps with that.</li>
            <li> Given as a present and the receiver said she loved it</li>
            <li> And when I woke up in the morning my eyeshadow was still on.  Over 24 hours of no creasing and no fading!</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and this stuff works wonders! Holds liquid or powder eyeshadow down. Even helps my gel eyeliner to stay on.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It dries fast and primes your eye lid well for eye shadow which then lasts all day long. Really great product!</li>
            <li> soon i buy&lt;br /&gt;e x c e l l e n t deal&lt;br /&gt;t h a n k&lt;br /&gt;y o u</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this from sephora and I loved it then. Still works great. Remember a little goes a long way. It will last a really long time and is definitely worth all of the money. I like to go out and dance and get sweaty and this keeps eyeshadow right in place. I don&#x27;t use the most expensive makeup, so this stuff really helps.</li>
