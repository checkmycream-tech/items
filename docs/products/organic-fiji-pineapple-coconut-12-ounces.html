            <li>I float the bottle in the warm bath water for a minute</li>

            <li>By now my hands have splits and cracks but not this year,my hands and body is very smooth</li>
            <li>My favorite skin care product ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I put it in my beard to keep it looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I found a suntan lotion with a pina colada scent.  </li>
            <li>and they love it as well.  </li>
            <li>and then I lather up my hair and body and just soak and relax to some good Smooth Jazz, as the aroma of pure organic coconut fills my senses.</li>
            <li>and i love that i can use it on the full body--including hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product if you are actually looking for the oil.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is a fantastic hair treatment.  </li>
            <li>I started attacking my severely dry skin  over a month  ago, my results  are excellent, thanks  to Figi  products.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall good moisturizer, I recommend.</li>
            <li>I plan on using the product in as a full body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love coconut and was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li>Smells great + keeps my skin smooth and moisturized during harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>love the fact that the main ingredient isnt water.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the refreshing pina colada scent and unlike regular lotions, there are no concerns about &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li>I love the pineapple scent in particular because I smell a bit like a pina colada which is not a problem for me at all.  </li>
            <li>I  can&#x27;t state enough praise about his amazing product.</li>
            <li>Love this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And to top it all off, the natural fragrance will lighten any mood.</li>
            <li>If the bottle is stored in a cool temperature it will become solid so to use it as more of an oil/lotion</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and the smell lasts on your body all day long.</li>
            <li>So if your bottle has solidified, just soak it in a sink of warm water or store the bottle near a heating vent or other warm area such as near a light (but not tooo close!)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  3/4 done with my first  bottle and</li>
            <li>I use the Figi body  scrub first then rub  this into my skin after towel drying.  </li>
            <li>The coconut oil, pineapple  oil together smells fresh and plushand  is really long-lasting.</li>
            <li>and getting caught in the rain!&amp;#34; Yep that that&#x27;s what popped into my head at first sniff.</li>
            <li>I love regular coconut oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>Just a tip/trick give it a try ;)</li>
            <li>but sadly I never found a replacement, until now.  </li>
            <li>Still a great product, just a little surprised when the bottle was first opened.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more, this is my favorite moisturizer all year long!</li>
            <li>Thanks to this nectar of the Gods, my whole Being is smiling!</li>
            <li>Tough to get a happy medium.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>We put it in the tub with her to warm it up and then use a small amount from head to toe.</li>
            <li>Goes from a solid to a liquid quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizerizing and its aromas bring you to a mental paradise.</li>
            <li>scrub to two other  people because they fell in love with the fragrance and  praised my dry skin care improvement.</li>
            <li>your skin feel so soft  </li>
            <li>must have for folks that want all natural moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>In spring and summer, I believe it is a natural sunscreen (up to a point), now I don&#x27;t use sunscreen products with toxic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m satiated, I complete my bath and my skin retains the soft glow and scent of coconut until my next bath.</li>
            <li>Though Organic Fiji doesn&#x27;t market it as such, since this contains coconut oil, it contains a limited amount of natural sun block properties.. not as a block per se, but somehow the coconut oil seems to keep me from getting a sunburn as fast in all the areas it has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its the only thing that keeps my skin soft</li>
            <li>I bought it for the fragrance though, nice smell for summer, doesn&#x27;t linger, disappears after a few minutes, at least on me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always been a fan of coconut oil for the skin but I love this product! It makes you skin really soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Oh, the Miracles of the Coconut! Thanks to this nectar of the Gods, my whole Being is smiling! I float the bottle in the warm bath water for a minute and then I lather up my hair and body and just soak and relax to some good Smooth Jazz, as the aroma of pure organic coconut fills my senses. When I&#x27;m satiated, I complete my bath and my skin retains the soft glow and scent of coconut until my next bath. I love all the Fiji lotions for in between bath touch ups!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! My favorite skin care product ever. It&#x27;s super moisturizerizing and its aromas bring you to a mental paradise. Also this product always arrives faster than expected!</li>
            <li> Good find. Love this product</li>
            <li> The merchant I used previously used discontinued selling the product. I was really excited to find it on Amazon. If you like coconut oil and love the pineapple-coconut fragrance, this is a must have skin care staple!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my body was drying out from the heat in the house and the cold weather.A friend had been using this product for awhile and told me to try it,well I have to say this is the best moisturizer I have ever used.By now my hands have splits and cracks but not this year,my hands and body is very smooth so please don&#x27;t stop producing this product,I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I really love this pineapple and coconut oil! It smells delicious and it my skin and hair is very healthy and glowing because of this fantastic item! I will definitely recommend it to anyone that can comprehend!</li>
            <li> I  can&#x27;t state enough praise about his amazing product. I&#x27;m  3/4 done with my first  bottle and my  2nd bottle  awaits  in my cupboard. I use the Figi body  scrub first then rub  this into my skin after towel drying.  I started attacking my severely dry skin  over a month  ago, my results  are excellent, thanks  to Figi  products.  The coconut oil, pineapple  oil together smells fresh and plushand  is really long-lasting. People  do ask  me why  did I smell like an island by the ocean. I have  given the Figi  body scrub to two other  people because they fell in love with the fragrance and  praised my dry skin care improvement. This  is a forever  staple  for  my skin  care.</li>
            <li> Best smelling and consistency I have tried yet.</li>
            <li> Goes from a solid to a liquid quickly. Tough to get a happy medium. Wouldve liked a more lotion consistency</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so very good! unfortunately i bought this for my father who was in the hospice at the time! i came back and one of the nurses had took it out of the room, We never did get it back! so that tells you its some good stuff! i bought 3 more since then! i love it! moisturizes so well!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil for so many reasons, I use it for shaving, moisturizing, in shower and out! Coconut oil has many benefits and this is a great product!</li>
            <li> We use this on our baby every night after her bath. We put it in the tub with her to warm it up and then use a small amount from head to toe. She smells really nice and her skin, scalp and hair look great! We love this product.</li>
            <li> and getting caught in the rain!&amp;#34; Yep that that&#x27;s what popped into my head at first sniff. Haha. And now that song is stuck in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jokes aside, this smells really good, moisturizes well and can be used for hair, body and face. It&#x27;s basically just coconut oil, the virgin kind with a pineapple fragrance. I love regular coconut oil for my hair. But this seems a bit different because it absorbs so well in the skin. I bought it for the fragrance though, nice smell for summer, doesn&#x27;t linger, disappears after a few minutes, at least on me. Overall good moisturizer, I recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells totally divine. I plan on using the product in as a full body moisturizer. Totally love this oil!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells AMAZING and the smell lasts on your body all day long. If the bottle is stored in a cool temperature it will become solid so to use it as more of an oil/lotion I just bring it into the shower and keep it on the floor of the tub while I shower, and by the time I get out it is an oil and I put it all over my body as soon as I get out. Just a tip/trick give it a try ;) Since using it my skin feels softer and healthier. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this as a Moisturizer from head to toe.  Smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Make your skin feel so soft  Takes all the dryness away.  Will be ordering&lt;br /&gt;more.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this rather than the lotion.  It&#x27;s a great product if you are actually looking for the oil.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times for my heels and for a hair treatment.</li>
            <li> This is Coconut oil!  Marketed when I bought it as Moisturizer. Still a great product, just a little surprised when the bottle was first opened.  Amazon has since changed the product title.  If oil only is what you are looking for 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells great + keeps my skin smooth and moisturized during harsh winter months. It does not make my skin breakout. I Def recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really delightful. I use after showering at the gym and everyone tells I smell great - &amp;#34;like a spa.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think it is great, I use it every day...I am going to recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is the real deal and it is awesome. I use it on my skin and I put it in my beard to keep it looking and feeling healthy. It&#x27;s smooth, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky/oily residue after you use it. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this natural moisturizer. I use it after a hydrating cream for a deep conditioner. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. I was really disappointed with this.  I love coconut and was really looking forward to this. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> love the fact that the main ingredient isnt water. and i love that i can use it on the full body--including hair. must have for folks that want all natural moisturizing. this is real great stuff here.</li>
            <li> smells so good. Makes my skin so soft. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I found a suntan lotion with a pina colada scent.  I loved the lotion&#x27;s scent but sadly I never found a replacement, until now.  The Organic Fiji Pineapple Coconut Oil is a heavenly massage oil, tanning oil and much more - from cooking to hair treatment!  I absolutely love the refreshing pina colada scent and unlike regular lotions, there are no concerns about &amp;#34;what am I putting on my skin?!&amp;#34;  Though Organic Fiji doesn&#x27;t market it as such, since this contains coconut oil, it contains a limited amount of natural sun block properties.. not as a block per se, but somehow the coconut oil seems to keep me from getting a sunburn as fast in all the areas it has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the coconut oil, when the bottle is kept at standard room temperature or cooler it will definitely solidify. Once the bottle is about 78F it will again return to a liquid state. So if your bottle has solidified, just soak it in a sink of warm water or store the bottle near a heating vent or other warm area such as near a light (but not tooo close!)  I will definitely be ordering more, this is my favorite moisturizer all year long!</li>
            <li> This stuff is divine.  Its the only thing that keeps my skin soft and I feel like it has helped during my recent weight loss with keeping my skin supple.  I love the pineapple scent in particular because I smell a bit like a pina colada which is not a problem for me at all.  I&#x27;ve gotten several of my friends to try it and they love it as well.  I also used after being in the sun and it helped take the sting out of a slight sunburn.</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer for my skin three times per week, and it helps me through the winter in a very dry climate.  In spring and summer, I believe it is a natural sunscreen (up to a point), now I don&#x27;t use sunscreen products with toxic chemicals.  Also, this is a fantastic hair treatment.  And to top it all off, the natural fragrance will lighten any mood.</li>
