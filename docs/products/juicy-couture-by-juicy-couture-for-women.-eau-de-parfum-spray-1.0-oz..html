            <li> This silvery, heavy plastic-feeling \\&quot;travel container\\&quot; is an awkwardly shaped container that is hard to press.  </li>

            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger</li>
            <li> I already had some of this &amp; knew how good it smelled. It arrived quickly &amp; did what it was suppose to do: Make me smell like a dream!</li>
            <li> great pricing! and it came so fast! i ordered it yesterday and had it within 24 hours (they&#x27;re located not too far from me in the same state, but STILL!). thank you Beauty Central!</li>
            <li> While my item was delivered on time, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that it looked different than what the seller had pictured.  I don&#x27;t know if Juicy has changed it&#x27;s packaging or the bottle it&#x27;s now in is different than what it used to be,  but it looked completely different and it&#x27;s hard to depress the button to release the perfume. So, I&#x27;m not sure what I received is exactly what I thought I had ordered.  The perfume does smell very good though.</li>
            <li> The product that i got my gf really is wonderful i didnt know what kind she likes so i got her this by geussing. And she loved it thankyou</li>
            <li> This silvery, heavy plastic-feeling \\&quot;travel container\\&quot; is an awkwardly shaped container that is hard to press.  I have to pump the top several times to get a tiny bit of product out.  It feels like there&#x27;s nothing in the container and is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t spray the best but I will make it work besides that It came on time and the price was awesome</li>
            <li> I got this prduct on time, proper;y packaged, and for a great price! I will definetly be buying more perfume from this seller!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it! Fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> It was what i expected to enjoy</li>
            <li> Got here fast! The smell is very classically floral. Can be strong, but lovely if it works well with your chemistry. All in all it&#x27;s a new favorite of mine, for sure. Great for spring ;)</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I got this product; would definetly do business with this company again.  Good job and great price</li>
            <li> Already like this scent and bought it for my six daughters!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I always buy the perfume instead of the eau de toilette because it takes fewer sprays and is therefore economical.  This perfume is a floral yet it has a spicy note too.  Juicy Couture fragrances are created by one of only two female French perfumers in the world.  This is the original fragrance and I like it the best.  It&#x27;s sexy but not too sweet.  I usually only wear French perfume and I really liked this when I tried it in the store.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle now.  I get many compliments when I wear it, and that is the ultimate test.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and packaging.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sexy smell I hope my product is the real deal bc if so wow beautifullllll smell and product presentation.</li>
