            <li>It is nice, a bit flowery though.  </li>
            <li>I find most of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s fragrances to be wonderful and affordable, but with True Love, she hit it out of the ballpark.</li>
            <li>TRUE LOVE by ELIZABETH ARDEN is describable as a beautiful and feminine scent.</li>
            <li>im soooooooo glad i was able to find one of my favorites for a good price</li>
            <li>Most fragrances just don&#x27;t smell nice on my skin, &amp; this is 1 of them....</li>
            <li>The price here was better than at a popular fragrance web site.</li>
            <li>Love the sweet smell, and the name.&lt;br /&gt;It will make a good gift to my friends.</li>
            <li>and I love it for every day.  </li>

            <li>What more can I say than buy this for your lady</li>
            <li>you both will love it, may even rekindle the flame.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for many years,and consider it &amp;#34;my signature&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments...</li>
            <li>I love it, and so does my spouse :-)</li>
            <li>Have had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>using this for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, i have been wearing it for years</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Its light and flowery!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>On some women this is just another scent, but on my wife it is provocative and sexy... alluring and sensual.</li>
            <li>An Elizabeth Arden fragrance, the scent is intricately sophisticated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a fragrance of it&#x27;s caliber and more.</li>
            <li>I found true love!</li>
            <li>I have been using True Love for many years now.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure to say this is not the REAL True Love by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too strong</li>
            <li>I liked the smell from the bottle and when it&#x27;s first sprayed but the fragrance was gone within minutes and never could even get a hint of it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing True Love for years</li>
            <li>This perfume has the name True Love</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, and I love the price and how quick I got it.  </li>
            <li>This spray is a light and refreshing aroma and the price is a super bargain.</li>
            <li>and I tend to go back to it even after I&#x27;ve used newer scents just because it truly is a lovely and sweet kind of smell that has a kind of light spice ending note.</li>
            <li>this is such a great fine to have found it on yours.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packaged nicely.   </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, and I get lots of complements whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li>It has a very subtle,soft floral fragrance, which is perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good for a couple of hours and then the scent dies like most fragrances, but it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to find, but I was happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feminine and TRUST me ladies, most men love this scent.</li>
            <li>If you need to buy a gift for somebody special buy this perfume.</li>
            <li>i had a bottle of this years ago and loved it but found it was 50 to 100 bucks in stores.i know why the price is low...</li>
            <li>Just what i expected, excellent present for a lady :)</li>
            <li>I love the soft, sensual, and sweet smelling fragrance!</li>
            <li>Although I tend to be drawn to bolder scents,  TRUE LOVE by Elizabeth Arden is one of the BEST kept secret&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>This cologne has a great scent, light enough to where it&#x27;s not over powering, but strong enough to where it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Lots to be happy about - little to complain about.  </li>
            <li>I first found this fragrance in the early 90&#x27;s, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, True Love is timeless and ageless.</li>
            <li>Soft and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Treat yourself at this price, you can&#x27;t lose, and once you do, you&#x27;ll be back for more \\&quot;True Love\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this Fragrance,True Love.it has a very feminine&amp; soft scent,not too cloying.</li>
            <li>, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume for the first time about 15 years ago</li>
            <li>At first it smells a bit funky but after it dries it smells wonderful, just like an extremely expensive one i used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>really liked it due to the benefits</li>
            <li>Large size bottle.</li>
            <li>I wear this scent about twice a week, it is a very nice scent for older women, that smells classy and not cheap.</li>
            <li>Romantic, feminine, demure but not overly-subtle, this is the kind of fragrance for the woman whose public persona is classic and elegant, but privately things can get pretty wild!</li>
            <li>Got it fast.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>and i got it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>This scent stays with you the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I do not have to put it on twice a day.</li>
            <li>I always love this perfume, the name is so romantic and the scent is soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>but other website wanted more.</li>
            <li>I bought it when I was younger,&amp; had it for special occasions, now I can buy it&amp; use it every day..</li>
            <li>I know different skin types hold scent differently, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again when there are so many others out there.</li>
            <li>It is very feminine, worthy of Elizabeth Arden, I didn&#x27;t think the scent lasted very long on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not positive that it isn&#x27;t a knock off, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it does smell exactly like the True Love she ran out of.</li>
            <li>I have no negative rate in this article</li>
            <li>This is my new fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus the price here on Amazon is unbeatable, I&#x27;ve always purchased mine at the mall for $30 more (and now they are really hard to find anywhere else).</li>
            <li>There was a time when you could only buy this at the finer stores at very high prices.</li>
            <li>Rather than the perfume wearing you this one compliments your natural scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is crisp and clean, has a lasting presence but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother, she only uses this particular brand and specifically asked me to bring this for her.</li>
            <li>To be able to order it here at this price is unbelievable, and it is not a cheap imposter, it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>Previous reviews were right about not seeing the Arden name anywhere on this product.</li>
            <li>Also if you are like me and most perfumes sour once you&#x27;ve applied it, this one won&#x27;t let you down!</li>
            <li>, large bottle for so little a price.</li>
            <li>It also drives men crazy and they truly do fall in love with it!</li>
            <li>so please just put a little on not too much</li>

            <li> so please just put a little on not too much</li>
            <li> I first in countered this perfume when I was a teen and have been wearing it for at least 18 year&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I always read the negative reviews first</li>
            <li> i have waited and waited for a price like this such a long time.</li>
            <li> Needs to be on the skin for about 1/2 an hour to really appreciate, and then, personal skin types and chemistry will yield subtle variations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , the fragrance stay in your skin all day, very suave and delicate</li>
            <li> I even apply it after a long stressful day to unwind.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I like that I can find my fav. perfume still. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and I always get compliments. You don&#x27;t need a lot. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not knowing how it smelled. I liked the smell from the bottle and when it&#x27;s first sprayed but the fragrance was gone within minutes and never could even get a hint of it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great Size! Great price! Recommended it!😊</li>
            <li> I have been wearing True Love for years and I love it for every day.  It has a very subtle,soft floral fragrance, which is perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a great scent, light enough to where it&#x27;s not over powering, but strong enough to where it lasts all day. I loved that I could order this on amazon, since I can&#x27;t find this fragrance anywhere. I would definitely recommend ordering this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden items are excellent quality.  This spray is a light and refreshing aroma and the price is a super bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, she only uses this particular brand and specifically asked me to bring this for her. She loves it!</li>
            <li> TRUE LOVE by ELIZABETH ARDEN is describable as a beautiful and feminine scent. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for the first time about 15 years ago and I tend to go back to it even after I&#x27;ve used newer scents just because it truly is a lovely and sweet kind of smell that has a kind of light spice ending note. The fragrance has a staying power and is not overwhelming. Plus the price here on Amazon is unbeatable, I&#x27;ve always purchased mine at the mall for $30 more (and now they are really hard to find anywhere else).</li>
            <li> My mom has loved this perfume for years.  It is kind of hard to find, but I was happy to see it on Amazon.  Fast shipping and packaged nicely.   Thank you!</li>
            <li> Got it fast. Love the smell. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Most fragrances just don&#x27;t smell nice on my skin, &amp; this is 1 of them....</li>
            <li> excellent very pleasant fragrance its smell</li>
            <li> What more can I say than buy this for your lady you both will love it, may even rekindle the flame.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years. It is great</li>
            <li> I love this Fragrance,True Love.it has a very feminine&amp; soft scent,not too cloying. I have been wearing it for many years,and consider it &amp;#34;my signature&amp;#34; fragrance. The price here was better than at a popular fragrance web site. Happy~</li>
            <li> Love Elizabeth Arden!  Great prices and it comes to your front door so you don&#x27;t have to go out to get it.</li>
            <li> Crappiest smell I&#x27;ve ever smelled.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like putrid water.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely won&#x27;t waste $$$ again.</li>
            <li> excellent recommending</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments... This is my new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Really soft and feminine as expected. Last all day as well.</li>
            <li> At first it smells a bit funky but after it dries it smells wonderful, just like an extremely expensive one i used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found true love! I love it, and so does my spouse :-) Its some kind of aphrodisiac that draws him in.  Its not over powering, and its scent gets softer throughout the day. It has staying power that you&#x27;ll simply know that you&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;True Love&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love it! Not too heavy of a scent but people still notice you are wearing it. Have had so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Lots to be happy about - little to complain about.  Spray works well. Scent isn&#x27;t too strong. Large size bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of other recommendations about the scent lasting.  although I like the scent a lot.  It is very feminine, worthy of Elizabeth Arden, I didn&#x27;t think the scent lasted very long on me.  I know different skin types hold scent differently, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again when there are so many others out there.</li>
            <li> i have waited and waited for a price like this such a long time. i buy this product over 2 years ago. but other website wanted more. this is such a great fine to have found it on yours. thank you.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY. GREAT VALUE. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. WILL ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I always love this perfume, the name is so romantic and the scent is soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Everything was just wonderful, the price and product was both great.</li>
            <li> Although I tend to be drawn to bolder scents,  TRUE LOVE by Elizabeth Arden is one of the BEST kept secret&#x27;s! I first in countered this perfume when I was a teen and have been wearing it for at least 18 year&#x27;s. It&#x27;s still my #1 scent to wear. I even apply it after a long stressful day to unwind.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s soft and feminine and TRUST me ladies, most men love this scent. Rather than the perfume wearing you this one compliments your natural scent. Also if you are like me and most perfumes sour once you&#x27;ve applied it, this one won&#x27;t let you down!</li>
            <li> Smell good but it&#x27;s too strong so please just put a little on not too much</li>
            <li> inexpensive playful experiance meant for everyday usage.</li>
            <li> Buy The fragance its not for The all day! Smell for a short time..... Its a wather de toill very simple...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, i have been wearing it for years and I get so many compliments. Its light and flowery!</li>
            <li> I first found this fragrance in the early 90&#x27;s, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, True Love is timeless and ageless. There was a time when you could only buy this at the finer stores at very high prices. To be able to order it here at this price is unbelievable, and it is not a cheap imposter, it&#x27;s the real deal! I find most of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s fragrances to be wonderful and affordable, but with True Love, she hit it out of the ballpark. The fragrance is crisp and clean, has a lasting presence but is not overwhelming. TRY IT! Treat yourself at this price, you can&#x27;t lose, and once you do, you&#x27;ll be back for more \\&quot;True Love\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Soft and elegant.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it due to the benefits are incredible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the price is too low. Perfect !</li>
            <li> im soooooooo glad i was able to find one of my favorites for a good price and i got it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> i had a bottle of this years ago and loved it but found it was 50 to 100 bucks in stores.i know why the price is low...it smells like a watered down version.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware. This perfume has the name True Love but I am pretty sure to say this is not the REAL True Love by Elizabeth Arden. This perfume has a harsh chemical smell and no where on the box does it say Elizabeth Arden.  There is certainly nothing wrong with &amp;#34;Knock Off&amp;#34; Perfumes--they just need to be labeled as such!!  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> nunca habia comprado usado este perfume lo compre y el aroma es excelente se queda en el cuerpo, es fresco lo recomiendo para ocasiones informales</li>
            <li> On some women this is just another scent, but on my wife it is provocative and sexy... alluring and sensual. Easily the most wonderful fragrance she wears and I never tire of if. Needs to be on the skin for about 1/2 an hour to really appreciate, and then, personal skin types and chemistry will yield subtle variations.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it by the gallon if it were sold that way...!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, and I love the price and how quick I got it.  I&#x27;m not positive that it isn&#x27;t a knock off, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it does smell exactly like the True Love she ran out of.</li>
            <li> A mi señora madre le encanto el perfume lo usa para todo le encanta el olor q deja en la ropa</li>
            <li> perfume delicado floral sem agredir o ofato e sua duração na pele dura bastante  recomendo o produto pois ele não é caro e o perfume tem cheiro de perfume caro.Amei este perfume e comprei dois e dei um para minha mãe e ela amou tambem e o usa todos os dias sem ficar enjoativo</li>
            <li> I have been using True Love for many years now. I love the soft, sensual, and sweet smelling fragrance! It doesn&#x27;t smell good for a couple of hours and then the scent dies like most fragrances, but it lasts all day long. It also drives men crazy and they truly do fall in love with it!</li>
            <li> It is a descent price. But this fragrance just doesn&#x27;t suit me well. I was a little disappointed the first time I tried it. I may not purchase this kind again.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden is a well-known brand. And this perfume is great to wear at night. If you need to buy a gift for somebody special buy this perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful!  It is not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, and I get lots of complements whenever I wear it.  The scent is light and lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This was knock off brand</li>
            <li> I bought it when I was younger,&amp; had it for special occasions, now I can buy it&amp; use it every day..</li>
            <li> Romantic, feminine, demure but not overly-subtle, this is the kind of fragrance for the woman whose public persona is classic and elegant, but privately things can get pretty wild! An Elizabeth Arden fragrance, the scent is intricately sophisticated. It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a fragrance of it&#x27;s caliber and more. This is a fragrance MUST buy!</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Content with the conditions in which I get this merchandise, despite having a problem with the Hugo Boss that came without the plastic protector I have no negative rate in this article, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I wear this scent about twice a week, it is a very nice scent for older women, that smells classy and not cheap. This scent stays with you the whole day.  I really like that I do not have to put it on twice a day.</li>
            <li> I always read the negative reviews first but I thought this is an Elizabeth Arden product how bad could it be, let&#x27;s just say this is a mixture of bug spay and light flowers. Previous reviews were right about not seeing the Arden name anywhere on this product. This has to be a marketing ploy to sell this so buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Just what i expected, excellent present for a lady :)</li>
            <li> nice smell and I receive a lot of compliments, the fragrance stay in your skin all day, very suave and delicate</li>
            <li> It is nice, a bit flowery though.  Bought it on a whim.  Works for everyday.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as I expected</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, large bottle for so little a price. Love the sweet smell, and the name.&lt;br /&gt;It will make a good gift to my friends.</li>
