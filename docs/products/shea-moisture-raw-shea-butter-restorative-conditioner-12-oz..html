            <li>Love, love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Well this is it! :)</li>
            <li>I love this Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Ok let me preface this by saying I have 4a-4b hair.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re left fumbling around to find a routine that this works best for.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li>I have used all of these products, but the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I find this product works better as a leave in conditioner versus rinsing out.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>I used some Curl and Shine Milk on top just to make it bearable</li>
            <li>My hair felt moisturized and healthy but the smell never truly dissipated.</li>
            <li>okay on to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better price at Target.</li>
            <li>omg I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This stuff works just OK as moisturizing my damp hair as a leave in.</li>
            <li>One more product for the graveyard.tion of hair.</li>
            <li>They need to invest in a better bottle.</li>
            <li>Ok, whatevs I think.  </li>
            <li>Love this one, love the Coconut line,</li>
            <li>My hair is more luxurious than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to try more Shea Moisture products at our house.</li>
            <li>I mostly wear my hair in twists or weaves</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product bi-weekly!.. , after trying so many products...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually better off washing with the shampoo and skipping this conditioner altogether.</li>
            <li>hair is thicker and growing much more in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I really really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the shea butter shampoo</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many sulfate free conditioner&#x27;s and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it in my hair and my kids as well.  </li>
            <li>I also love that they are so affordable, though you would not guess it from the price being listed here.</li>
            <li>and God bless :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE that there is no build up.</li>
            <li>but i just love how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok.</li>
            <li>It may not have slip to many curlies with type 4 hair (if you&#x27;re in to hair typing)</li>
            <li>and I have been fairly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and light and coats and cling to my hair, root to tip.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Its very strong, almost like perfume , strong perfum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about these products :)</li>
            <li>We were glad to see that this product was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li>I was instantly hooked, it smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li>This is the best product we have ever tried and is 1/3 the price of other salon products we&#x27;ve tried(if</li>
            <li>this product works well on my hair and the price is great too, id definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and both of my kids have lovely kinky curls, and it is great to use daily on my son&#x27;s curls, which tend to be drier.  </li>
            <li>Way too strong scent.</li>
            <li>I needed this to be a strong conditioner</li>
            <li>The scent is nauseating and strong.  </li>
            <li>As a leave in, this works just as good as Giovanni direct leave in which I love.</li>
            <li>Its smell is nice, but it is also pretty strong when a lot is used.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist can&#x27;t get over how full and healthy my hair has been since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I leave in my hair for 5 mins and it works fine</li>
            <li>With the very first application, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It leaves perfectly defined curls that are soft to the touch with a bit of sheen, and doesn&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin/scalp at all.</li>
            <li>I just spritz lightly with an aloe vera juice/water based mixture before I leave for work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners from many different product lines over the years, and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and protein free and packs a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li>This product is available at Walgreens for 9.99, though.</li>
            <li>And they are CRUELTY FREE, which is also important to me.</li>
            <li>I used it as a deep moisturizer and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li>my hair is 4a with some patches of 4b if that is relevant to the convo...  </li>
            <li>I use it like a daily moisturizer and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>They often have buy one, get one free deals.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works great for my hair to  detangle and add lasting softness</li>
            <li>Background:&lt;br /&gt;Completely chemical free since 4/10/09&lt;br /&gt;APL, S-curls that coil at the ends</li>
            <li>Gives great moisture, especially when you have your hair color treated like mine.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and it smells really good like vanilla cake frosting.  </li>
            <li>(the relaxed ends looked silky and great but the roots and new growth--not so much)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>$3 Suave Naturals Conditioner has more moisture and higher quality.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is smooth and sweet smelling when I remember to put it in her hair.</li>
            <li>I fell in love after the first use and I will be using the products for now on.....</li>
            <li>I fell in love with shea moisture after the first wash.</li>
            <li>so when they came out with the conditioner, I got excited....</li>
            <li>but boy was it dry and  fly away at the roots  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Oh, I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a full sized version of this</li>
            <li>it or not i continue to purchase this because i love the ingredients and product line so much</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, seriously, doesn&#x27;t leave residues and the hair look super natural and curly, my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li>dos not make my hair crunch... nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture Organic Curl enhancing smoothie (mouth full)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>In general, I have found that Shea Moisture products are really great once you figure out how to use them on your particular hair.</li>
            <li>This restorative conditioner is awesome as far as detangling my new growth which is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>Mild scent (even after 1 week).     </li>
            <li>I get better slip with the same moister with my suave humectant conditioner and the price is cut in more than half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review in my life, but I love this product so much that I think it&#x27;s worth writing about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I kind of expected more.  </li>
            <li>Get a new bottle, if has a sweet, lovely smell.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and smells great without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li>I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave-in and my hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li>(BTW - I never never rub with the towel, only pat - helps avoid frizz.)I cannot believe my hair is shiny again, and looks healthy after just ONE USE of these products!</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling shiny, healthy, and manageable!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine, not a lot of shine</li>
            <li>They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It would be good for those with very dry hair, but leaves my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY DETANGLED!!!!!</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair moisturized and soft, so that is its redeeming qualities.  </li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the price or time.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try to brush through it (from bottom to top) as much as I could no matter how much it messed up my hair.</li>
            <li>(I use a full pump since I have so much hair) and I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>Also, it is NOT pricey--you can buy it at Target or Walgreens for $9.99, and I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Ever since I went natural about a month ago, it&#x27;s been an interesting journey in regards to my hair routine.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and moisturized it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>and I love that it cleans my hair without stripping it and is also very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick which is very good</li>
            <li>right now</li>
            <li>I then conditioned with this product and it appeared to do the trick right away</li>
            <li>So as I added to my hair, it went on smooth with a decent amount of slip.</li>
            <li>This and the deep treatment masque (which is great as a deep conditioner, not just leave-in) are permanent staples in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I went back and bought 5 more of these</li>
            <li>I first used this as a rinse out conditioner and the results was so-so.  </li>
            <li>One squirt is enough for my hair hair, any more</li>
            <li>This is a no fail style for me during the week.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I tried in the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li>you do choose to buy this product, please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than$9.99!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is great for extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li>the conditioner pictured here is white in color, as are most of the bottles in Target where I purchase this.</li>
            <li>AND I STILL COULDN&#x27;T BRUSH THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!</li>
            <li>Well it remained soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is frizz free, silky and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, the first day I used it</li>
            <li>I recommend squirting it into your hand and rubbing it around first</li>
            <li>Love it as a leave in after wash and condition especially seal with oil and use with my flexi rod set and my hair stays shiny and moisturized for days!</li>
            <li>His curls stay healthy using this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, I could tell it was really moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I first saw the Shea Moisture products in Target.</li>
            <li>first, I was one of those curlies who thought that this conditioner is only better as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>use this in many different ways.</li>
            <li>And as I&#x27;m new to natural, my top priority at the moment is to keep it moist</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is more natural than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target thinking it couldn&#x27;t be much good because it was inexpensive, I&#x27;ve spent so much money on high priced conditioners over the years</li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing on my coarse naturally curly 4a,b,c,z  hair.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and I will definitely purchase more when I am done with this bottle.</li>
            <li>The most important feature i look for in a conditioner is its slip because i have thick 4a natural hair and when wash days come around I want to get all the shedding hair and tangles out easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine, Caucasian, healthy, low-porosity hair and usually products with a lot of oils in them</li>
            <li>Love using this on my long hair!</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I LOVE this line it saved my hair from dry brittle days, and i pray this company never discontinue or change their ingredients.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture should also think about making it into a bigger value size because I run through it easily</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, long hair (just below my bust) and this product smells wonderful in my hair.</li>
            <li>So...as of right now the only main products that I&#x27;m enjoying are Design Essentials - the Natural line and Trader Joe Products.</li>
            <li>I have naturally kinky hair and after being natural for 1 year, I am finding products to fit into my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>As the winter months progress, I dont really shampoo as often (therefore not using the Shea Butter Shampoo).</li>
            <li>For me, it doesn&#x27;t have much slip to detangle, so I use it as my leave-in.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>so moisture is much needed, along with the shampoo</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my hair moisturized</li>
            <li>and my curls are really defined.  </li>
            <li>So amazon can shove it for that high price I&#x27;m going to walgreen!</li>
            <li>So I figured maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for not only African American Hair!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Shae Moisture.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s is even thicker and can be really frizzy.</li>
            <li>After taking out my weaves this summer, I had very coarse hair, unmanageable hair and couldn&#x27;t figure out what product to use to get in smooth again......  </li>
            <li>It really does nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>Imagine a person who has used way too much perfume.</li>
            <li>It has curls that are S shaped and grows in straight but curls on the ends.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer it on her hair.</li>
            <li>As soom as I put in in my hair curls started to pop up that I had never seen before because of the dryness(this product does not create curls) and my hair felt very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In a bid to pull the ol&#x27; \\&quot;i can get my own green food\\</li>
            <li>There are no parabens, no silicones, and plenty of natural oils to help nurse hair back to health or maintain a healthy hair care regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still dry (which is the nature of most people&#x27;s natural black hair), but it&#x27;s growing and getting better!</li>
            <li>I have read on other reviews that it works better as a leave in so</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitate but after a few uses I fell completely in love.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand a lot and have been using the body wash for this particular collection for around a year now.</li>
            <li>and i could feel it less coarse and more smooth than before......</li>
            <li>When I take them down at the end of the week to shampoo, etc, my hair still feels nice and soft...</li>
            <li>I use the baby shampoo for myself rather than the regular shampoo as I have very fine, fragile hair</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product when I dyed my hair with the Shea Moisture Hair Color System and my hair was so soft and my curls were SO defined.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product during my transition period (of going natural)</li>
            <li>love the fact that this conditioner only boasts natural ingredients, is sulfate free, and has argon oil in it among other things.</li>
            <li>When I first went natural</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is a multi-use conditioner, i.e. it can be used as a rinse-out, as a mild deep conditioner, and as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li>I love most of the Shea Moisture products that I have tried, but I was not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>for over 5 years, always with super dryness as my only concern.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product but in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Once again with the Curl and Style Milk, coconut oil was high up on the ingredients list.    </li>
            <li>I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; frizzy, highly porous hair that has begun thinning.</li>
            <li>My other store bought conditioners just had too many chemicals in them that didn&#x27;t make my hair shine or feel as soft as it should.</li>
            <li>I apply the product to soaking wet hair and smooth it in.</li>
            <li>The next time I used this, I used it on damp hair that was fresh from a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Took a while to arrive, but when it finally did, it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Whenever my hair gets frizzy from humidity or sweat, I use this as a leave-in conditioner on dry hair, and my hair becomes soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>use it only as a leave in and it detangles my hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>I thought the shampoo and conditioner would be just as great, but it was a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I use other products.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the thickness of the conditioner and the smell lingered on my hair strands but other than that</li>
            <li>So it took me about a year to find a new product.  </li>
            <li>I always wash it out even though it says it can be used as a leave in conditioner as well, but I live in a humid climate and don&#x27;t need the additional moisture.</li>
            <li>Already in love with the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo</li>
            <li>Yet, it is light enough that it can be used in different textures.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li>The moisture just stays in as I style and it keep my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I also have a very sensitive scalp and this product hasn&#x27;t irritated it.</li>
            <li>I find that that once I&#x27;m done drying, my hair is very soft, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been Natural (yay!)</li>
            <li>Your money will serve you better in a purchase of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (with several dollars left over).</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I absolutely love this product as a conditioner, and I usually leave some in my hair purposely.</li>
            <li>FYI, this only costs $9.99 in target and walgreens ;)</li>
            <li>I am not sure how they are justifying adding in almost seven (7) more dollars for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many products in this line and really you can&#x27;t go wrong with trying this particular product and the many other products Shea moisture supplies.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, blonde hair and my daughter&#x27;s, who&#x27;s a toehead, is even finer.</li>
            <li>This product, along with the Moisture Retention shampoo, and other Shea products, are GREAT for thick, naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Next time when I wash my hair I will be rinsing this stuff out and going to my hibiscus mist and homemade moisturizing spray because this conditioner so far, is a no go for my first time use.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of reviews complaining about the smell of saying that it&#x27;s not moistuzing enough but so far nothing on this ingredient which is said to be highly toxic over .1% and very detrimental to our  environment..</li>
            <li>Be fair warned, if you leave it in as a conditioner it stays on thick in your hair, and it takes a longer time to blow dry.</li>
            <li>Also since its a more pricey conditioner I plan to only use it for deep conditioning treatments on my dry 3b hair.</li>
            <li>Instead I use a little cantu leave in or just apply some light coconut oil.</li>
            <li>(I have short, fine, natural african american hair).</li>
            <li>My hair stopped breaking, stopped being hard, and eventually (about a year) came back to a nice, soft, supple feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike me, my fiance liked the smell, but too me, it smells like bad and cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I was floored when my hair turned out soft shiny and bouncy the way it used to be before I started torturing it with bleach.  </li>
            <li>After transitioning out of braids, I needed a shampoo and conditioner that felt soothing and not harsh on my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Humidity completely turns my hair into mini afro-puffs.</li>
            <li>I am newly natural, but I used to have mid-back length relaxed hair and have used it on both natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>And its all Natural Organic ingredients, Organic Shea butter, sea kelp, Argan oil (which is known for its hair growing and strengthening properties) Coconut oil, Vitamin B-5, Avocado oil,Vitamin E, Carrot Seed oil, and Honeysuckle flower extract.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow, as soon as I opened the conditioner bottle</li>
            <li>i use it as a leave in conditioner, it makes my hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>Going natural in hair products require searching for the products all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand the SM yellow line&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had so much hair that had fallen out and was stuck in the big dread</li>
            <li>and this got it all out, smoothed it and completely detangled it all.</li>
            <li>soft--</li>
            <li>Then I started looking on here and re-searching natural hair and realized the number one thing natural hair needs....</li>
            <li>I spied it at the store and the fact that it is supposed to be all natural seemed great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the shampoo alone and just using that my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li>I have natural type 4 hair</li>
            <li>I discovered this hair care line after reading a natural hair care book.</li>
            <li>so I forgot what grade my natural hair was.  </li>
            <li>the only problem with using products that soften my hair too much is that I always have to put a curl-defining pudding or creme into my hair in order to define my curl.</li>
            <li>natural 3c hair</li>
            <li>Now that I am two years plus being natural</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my locks soft and moisturized with no greasy buildup or dryness.</li>
            <li>My curls pop instantly and my hair is VERY defined and moisturize.</li>
            <li>After use my hair feels fantastic and as a natural product I know it&#x27;s not killing my hair with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I will try it a few more times to see if I can justify buying it over again since I can buy 2 giovanni bottles for the same cost.</li>
            <li>especially for transitioning to natural hair!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent enough on my natural hair as a leave-in that</li>
            <li>It is not thick but medium (between fine and thick).  </li>
            <li>Now, I will admit, once you rinse it out, it can be a bit stiff but trust me when I say, my hair was super soft, detangled, and moisturized like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li>While I normally rinse it out all out, the last time I washed my hair</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li>Not miracle cures, not yet, but helping - some less frizz, less breakage, hair getting back to better health!  </li>
            <li>It did leave my natural hair feeling moisturized at first, but once it had time to settle, my hair felt slightly dry and there was still somewhat of a film left on the surface of my hair, which I do not like.</li>
            <li>My original bottle has a slightly yellow-is cast but its the same product as I have checked the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Since I have gone natural I have spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do.</li>
            <li>A week later, my hair is moisturized, soft, with a natural shine to it.</li>
            <li>and I had to use more than necessary to coat my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I only put conditioner on my bottom 3/4 (my hair dresser said to never put conditioner on the roots), and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is all the way to the tip!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk, Deep Treatment Masque (many people hate it as a deep conditioner, but just as many seem to rave about it as a leave-in), and Thickening Growth Milk as leave-ins.</li>
            <li>You can find this in almost any story for right around $10.00, often less than that price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo that goes with this conditioner left my hair soft and easy to detangle in the shower with the least amount of effort.</li>
            <li>Currently, I use this only when I&#x27;ve run out of my staple leave-in, but it&#x27;s a decent replacement.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for those who want to lose the chemicals, get back to basics, and purchase high quality items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually absorbs into the hair and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to use as a leave in to try and replace my Giovanni Direct Leave-In, seeing as that product isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li>Even if I am the only woman on Earth to say this, do _NOT_ waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Then I deep conditioned with this and was in awe at how it made my hair go from soft as silk to \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Since my transitioning I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural ingredients for my hair such as shampoos, conditioners, and moisturizers are concerned.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it as a leave in and also to dry finger detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>soft but couple hours later.</li>
            <li>I have low porosity 4a natural hair.</li>
            <li>After my hair is dried, my hair was pretty soft and had some sheen to it.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that touches the top of my butt.</li>
            <li>stuff is all natural, which it is VERY VERY hard to find true all natural stuff w/o alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but it has a texture that is dry normally and gets frizzy without a gel or mousse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light product, and a little goes a long way especially when combined with water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY thick, so one or two pumps should be more than enough.</li>
            <li>So the second time I used it put it in my hair as a leave in, to moisture a week old double strand twist set that I had.</li>
            <li>African American natural hair-</li>
            <li>i am a 32 year old african american female.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4a/b/c hair type (if you are into the hair typing system) and my hair is forever dry.  </li>
            <li>Helps make dry hair soft.  </li>
            <li>If you are protein sensitive (your hair gets dry with protein like mine)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is pretty thick and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I use this a a leave in styling creme for my infant daughter who is 9 months old with a head of short curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>but it definitely looks much better since I have been using the  Raw Shea Shampoo and Conditioner together for the past month.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way like a lot of the Shea Moisture products, I had my first bottle forever.  </li>
            <li>I did learn from the first use that a little bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> It is rich, moisturizing, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, but I liked the shampoo better.</li>
            <li> love the pump top!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product I have used of all the ones I have reviewed or purchased thus far.  </li>
            <li> best product i had ever tryed, it makes my hair so soft an manageable give this one a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This was great at first.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars :)    </li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I hope for the love of god that they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> and I agree it is better as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well this is it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Ok let me preface this by saying I have 4a-4b hair.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re left fumbling around to find a routine that this works best for.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have used all of these products, but the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I find this product works better as a leave in conditioner versus rinsing out.</li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> I used some Curl and Shine Milk on top just to make it bearable</li>
            <li> My hair felt moisturized and healthy but the smell never truly dissipated.</li>
            <li> okay on to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better price at Target.</li>
            <li> omg I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff works just OK as moisturizing my damp hair as a leave in.</li>
            <li> One more product for the graveyard.tion of hair.</li>
            <li> They need to invest in a better bottle.</li>
            <li> Ok, whatevs I think.  </li>
            <li> Love this one, love the Coconut line,</li>
            <li> My hair is more luxurious than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Ok-</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try more Shea Moisture products at our house.</li>
            <li> I mostly wear my hair in twists or weaves</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product bi-weekly!.. , after trying so many products...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually better off washing with the shampoo and skipping this conditioner altogether.</li>
            <li> hair is thicker and growing much more in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter shampoo</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sulfate free conditioner&#x27;s and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I am able to use it in my hair and my kids as well.  </li>
            <li> I also love that they are so affordable, though you would not guess it from the price being listed here.</li>
            <li> and God bless :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE that there is no build up.</li>
            <li> but i just love how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok.</li>
            <li> It may not have slip to many curlies with type 4 hair (if you&#x27;re in to hair typing)</li>
            <li> and I have been fairly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and light and coats and cling to my hair, root to tip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Its very strong, almost like perfume , strong perfum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about these products :)</li>
            <li> We were glad to see that this product was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li> I was instantly hooked, it smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> This is the best product we have ever tried and is 1/3 the price of other salon products we&#x27;ve tried(if</li>
            <li> this product works well on my hair and the price is great too, id definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and both of my kids have lovely kinky curls, and it is great to use daily on my son&#x27;s curls, which tend to be drier.  </li>
            <li> Way too strong scent.</li>
            <li> I needed this to be a strong conditioner</li>
            <li> The scent is nauseating and strong.  </li>
            <li> As a leave in, this works just as good as Giovanni direct leave in which I love.</li>
            <li> Its smell is nice, but it is also pretty strong when a lot is used.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist can&#x27;t get over how full and healthy my hair has been since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I leave in my hair for 5 mins and it works fine</li>
            <li> With the very first application, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It leaves perfectly defined curls that are soft to the touch with a bit of sheen, and doesn&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin/scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I just spritz lightly with an aloe vera juice/water based mixture before I leave for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners from many different product lines over the years, and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and protein free and packs a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is available at Walgreens for 9.99, though.</li>
            <li> And they are CRUELTY FREE, which is also important to me.</li>
            <li> I used it as a deep moisturizer and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li> my hair is 4a with some patches of 4b if that is relevant to the convo...  </li>
            <li> I use it like a daily moisturizer and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> They often have buy one, get one free deals.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it works great for my hair to  detangle and add lasting softness</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;Completely chemical free since 4/10/09&lt;br /&gt;APL, S-curls that coil at the ends</li>
            <li> Gives great moisture, especially when you have your hair color treated like mine.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and it smells really good like vanilla cake frosting.  </li>
            <li> (the relaxed ends looked silky and great but the roots and new growth--not so much)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> $3 Suave Naturals Conditioner has more moisture and higher quality.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is smooth and sweet smelling when I remember to put it in her hair.</li>
            <li> I fell in love after the first use and I will be using the products for now on.....</li>
            <li> I fell in love with shea moisture after the first wash.</li>
            <li> so when they came out with the conditioner, I got excited....</li>
            <li> but boy was it dry and  fly away at the roots  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so clean &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a full sized version of this</li>
            <li> it or not i continue to purchase this because i love the ingredients and product line so much</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, seriously, doesn&#x27;t leave residues and the hair look super natural and curly, my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li> dos not make my hair crunch... nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Organic Curl enhancing smoothie (mouth full)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> In general, I have found that Shea Moisture products are really great once you figure out how to use them on your particular hair.</li>
            <li> This restorative conditioner is awesome as far as detangling my new growth which is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> Mild scent (even after 1 week).     </li>
            <li> I get better slip with the same moister with my suave humectant conditioner and the price is cut in more than half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review in my life, but I love this product so much that I think it&#x27;s worth writing about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I kind of expected more.  </li>
            <li> Get a new bottle, if has a sweet, lovely smell.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and smells great without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave-in and my hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li> (BTW - I never never rub with the towel, only pat - helps avoid frizz.)I cannot believe my hair is shiny again, and looks healthy after just ONE USE of these products!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling shiny, healthy, and manageable!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine, not a lot of shine</li>
            <li> They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It would be good for those with very dry hair, but leaves my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY DETANGLED!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair moisturized and soft, so that is its redeeming qualities.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t worth the price or time.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try to brush through it (from bottom to top) as much as I could no matter how much it messed up my hair.</li>
            <li> (I use a full pump since I have so much hair) and I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Also, it is NOT pricey--you can buy it at Target or Walgreens for $9.99, and I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went natural about a month ago, it&#x27;s been an interesting journey in regards to my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and moisturized it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Love that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> and I love that it cleans my hair without stripping it and is also very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick which is very good</li>
            <li> right now</li>
            <li> I then conditioned with this product and it appeared to do the trick right away</li>
            <li> So as I added to my hair, it went on smooth with a decent amount of slip.</li>
            <li> This and the deep treatment masque (which is great as a deep conditioner, not just leave-in) are permanent staples in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I went back and bought 5 more of these</li>
            <li> I first used this as a rinse out conditioner and the results was so-so.  </li>
            <li> One squirt is enough for my hair hair, any more</li>
            <li> This is a no fail style for me during the week.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I tried in the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li> you do choose to buy this product, please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than$9.99!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is great for extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> the conditioner pictured here is white in color, as are most of the bottles in Target where I purchase this.</li>
            <li> AND I STILL COULDN&#x27;T BRUSH THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!</li>
            <li> Well it remained soft and tangle free</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is frizz free, silky and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, the first day I used it</li>
            <li> I recommend squirting it into your hand and rubbing it around first</li>
            <li> Love it as a leave in after wash and condition especially seal with oil and use with my flexi rod set and my hair stays shiny and moisturized for days!</li>
            <li> His curls stay healthy using this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , I could tell it was really moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I first saw the Shea Moisture products in Target.</li>
            <li> first, I was one of those curlies who thought that this conditioner is only better as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> use this in many different ways.</li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;m new to natural, my top priority at the moment is to keep it moist</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is more natural than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target thinking it couldn&#x27;t be much good because it was inexpensive, I&#x27;ve spent so much money on high priced conditioners over the years</li>
            <li> This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing on my coarse naturally curly 4a,b,c,z  hair.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and I will definitely purchase more when I am done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> The most important feature i look for in a conditioner is its slip because i have thick 4a natural hair and when wash days come around I want to get all the shedding hair and tangles out easily.</li>
            <li> I have fine, Caucasian, healthy, low-porosity hair and usually products with a lot of oils in them</li>
            <li> Love using this on my long hair!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I LOVE this line it saved my hair from dry brittle days, and i pray this company never discontinue or change their ingredients.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture should also think about making it into a bigger value size because I run through it easily</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, long hair (just below my bust) and this product smells wonderful in my hair.</li>
            <li> So...as of right now the only main products that I&#x27;m enjoying are Design Essentials - the Natural line and Trader Joe Products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally kinky hair and after being natural for 1 year, I am finding products to fit into my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> As the winter months progress, I dont really shampoo as often (therefore not using the Shea Butter Shampoo).</li>
            <li> For me, it doesn&#x27;t have much slip to detangle, so I use it as my leave-in.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> so moisture is much needed, along with the shampoo</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> and my curls are really defined.  </li>
            <li> So amazon can shove it for that high price I&#x27;m going to walgreen!</li>
            <li> So I figured maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li> This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for not only African American Hair!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Shae Moisture.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s is even thicker and can be really frizzy.</li>
            <li> After taking out my weaves this summer, I had very coarse hair, unmanageable hair and couldn&#x27;t figure out what product to use to get in smooth again......  </li>
            <li> It really does nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> Imagine a person who has used way too much perfume.</li>
            <li> It has curls that are S shaped and grows in straight but curls on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but I much prefer it on her hair.</li>
            <li> As soom as I put in in my hair curls started to pop up that I had never seen before because of the dryness(this product does not create curls) and my hair felt very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In a bid to pull the ol&#x27; \\&quot;i can get my own green food\\</li>
            <li> There are no parabens, no silicones, and plenty of natural oils to help nurse hair back to health or maintain a healthy hair care regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still dry (which is the nature of most people&#x27;s natural black hair), but it&#x27;s growing and getting better!</li>
            <li> I have read on other reviews that it works better as a leave in so</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitate but after a few uses I fell completely in love.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand a lot and have been using the body wash for this particular collection for around a year now.</li>
            <li> and i could feel it less coarse and more smooth than before......</li>
            <li> When I take them down at the end of the week to shampoo, etc, my hair still feels nice and soft...</li>
            <li> I use the baby shampoo for myself rather than the regular shampoo as I have very fine, fragile hair</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product when I dyed my hair with the Shea Moisture Hair Color System and my hair was so soft and my curls were SO defined.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product during my transition period (of going natural)</li>
            <li> love the fact that this conditioner only boasts natural ingredients, is sulfate free, and has argon oil in it among other things.</li>
            <li> When I first went natural</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a multi-use conditioner, i.e. it can be used as a rinse-out, as a mild deep conditioner, and as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li> I love most of the Shea Moisture products that I have tried, but I was not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> for over 5 years, always with super dryness as my only concern.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Once again with the Curl and Style Milk, coconut oil was high up on the ingredients list.    </li>
            <li> I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; frizzy, highly porous hair that has begun thinning.</li>
            <li> My other store bought conditioners just had too many chemicals in them that didn&#x27;t make my hair shine or feel as soft as it should.</li>
            <li> I apply the product to soaking wet hair and smooth it in.</li>
            <li> The next time I used this, I used it on damp hair that was fresh from a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but when it finally did, it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Whenever my hair gets frizzy from humidity or sweat, I use this as a leave-in conditioner on dry hair, and my hair becomes soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> use it only as a leave in and it detangles my hair and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> I thought the shampoo and conditioner would be just as great, but it was a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I use other products.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the thickness of the conditioner and the smell lingered on my hair strands but other than that</li>
            <li> So it took me about a year to find a new product.  </li>
            <li> I always wash it out even though it says it can be used as a leave in conditioner as well, but I live in a humid climate and don&#x27;t need the additional moisture.</li>
            <li> Already in love with the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo</li>
            <li> Yet, it is light enough that it can be used in different textures.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li> The moisture just stays in as I style and it keep my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I also have a very sensitive scalp and this product hasn&#x27;t irritated it.</li>
            <li> I find that that once I&#x27;m done drying, my hair is very soft, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been Natural (yay!)</li>
            <li> Your money will serve you better in a purchase of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (with several dollars left over).</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I absolutely love this product as a conditioner, and I usually leave some in my hair purposely.</li>
            <li> FYI, this only costs $9.99 in target and walgreens ;)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how they are justifying adding in almost seven (7) more dollars for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many products in this line and really you can&#x27;t go wrong with trying this particular product and the many other products Shea moisture supplies.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, blonde hair and my daughter&#x27;s, who&#x27;s a toehead, is even finer.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Moisture Retention shampoo, and other Shea products, are GREAT for thick, naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Next time when I wash my hair I will be rinsing this stuff out and going to my hibiscus mist and homemade moisturizing spray because this conditioner so far, is a no go for my first time use.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews complaining about the smell of saying that it&#x27;s not moistuzing enough but so far nothing on this ingredient which is said to be highly toxic over .1% and very detrimental to our  environment..</li>
            <li> Be fair warned, if you leave it in as a conditioner it stays on thick in your hair, and it takes a longer time to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Also since its a more pricey conditioner I plan to only use it for deep conditioning treatments on my dry 3b hair.</li>
            <li> Instead I use a little cantu leave in or just apply some light coconut oil.</li>
            <li> (I have short, fine, natural african american hair).</li>
            <li> My hair stopped breaking, stopped being hard, and eventually (about a year) came back to a nice, soft, supple feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike me, my fiance liked the smell, but too me, it smells like bad and cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> I was floored when my hair turned out soft shiny and bouncy the way it used to be before I started torturing it with bleach.  </li>
            <li> After transitioning out of braids, I needed a shampoo and conditioner that felt soothing and not harsh on my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Humidity completely turns my hair into mini afro-puffs.</li>
            <li> I am newly natural, but I used to have mid-back length relaxed hair and have used it on both natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> And its all Natural Organic ingredients, Organic Shea butter, sea kelp, Argan oil (which is known for its hair growing and strengthening properties) Coconut oil, Vitamin B-5, Avocado oil,Vitamin E, Carrot Seed oil, and Honeysuckle flower extract.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow, as soon as I opened the conditioner bottle</li>
            <li> i use it as a leave in conditioner, it makes my hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> Going natural in hair products require searching for the products all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand the SM yellow line&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had so much hair that had fallen out and was stuck in the big dread</li>
            <li> and this got it all out, smoothed it and completely detangled it all.</li>
            <li> soft--</li>
            <li> Then I started looking on here and re-searching natural hair and realized the number one thing natural hair needs....</li>
            <li> I spied it at the store and the fact that it is supposed to be all natural seemed great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shampoo alone and just using that my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair care line after reading a natural hair care book.</li>
            <li> so I forgot what grade my natural hair was.  </li>
            <li> the only problem with using products that soften my hair too much is that I always have to put a curl-defining pudding or creme into my hair in order to define my curl.</li>
            <li> natural 3c hair</li>
            <li> Now that I am two years plus being natural</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my locks soft and moisturized with no greasy buildup or dryness.</li>
            <li> My curls pop instantly and my hair is VERY defined and moisturize.</li>
            <li> After use my hair feels fantastic and as a natural product I know it&#x27;s not killing my hair with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I will try it a few more times to see if I can justify buying it over again since I can buy 2 giovanni bottles for the same cost.</li>
            <li> especially for transitioning to natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent enough on my natural hair as a leave-in that</li>
            <li> It is not thick but medium (between fine and thick).  </li>
            <li> Now, I will admit, once you rinse it out, it can be a bit stiff but trust me when I say, my hair was super soft, detangled, and moisturized like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li> While I normally rinse it out all out, the last time I washed my hair</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> Not miracle cures, not yet, but helping - some less frizz, less breakage, hair getting back to better health!  </li>
            <li> It did leave my natural hair feeling moisturized at first, but once it had time to settle, my hair felt slightly dry and there was still somewhat of a film left on the surface of my hair, which I do not like.</li>
            <li> My original bottle has a slightly yellow-is cast but its the same product as I have checked the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural I have spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do.</li>
            <li> A week later, my hair is moisturized, soft, with a natural shine to it.</li>
            <li> and I had to use more than necessary to coat my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I only put conditioner on my bottom 3/4 (my hair dresser said to never put conditioner on the roots), and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is all the way to the tip!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk, Deep Treatment Masque (many people hate it as a deep conditioner, but just as many seem to rave about it as a leave-in), and Thickening Growth Milk as leave-ins.</li>
            <li> You can find this in almost any story for right around $10.00, often less than that price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo that goes with this conditioner left my hair soft and easy to detangle in the shower with the least amount of effort.</li>
            <li> Currently, I use this only when I&#x27;ve run out of my staple leave-in, but it&#x27;s a decent replacement.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for those who want to lose the chemicals, get back to basics, and purchase high quality items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually absorbs into the hair and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to use as a leave in to try and replace my Giovanni Direct Leave-In, seeing as that product isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li> Even if I am the only woman on Earth to say this, do _NOT_ waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Then I deep conditioned with this and was in awe at how it made my hair go from soft as silk to \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since my transitioning I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural ingredients for my hair such as shampoos, conditioners, and moisturizers are concerned.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it as a leave in and also to dry finger detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> soft but couple hours later.</li>
            <li> I have low porosity 4a natural hair.</li>
            <li> After my hair is dried, my hair was pretty soft and had some sheen to it.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that touches the top of my butt.</li>
            <li> stuff is all natural, which it is VERY VERY hard to find true all natural stuff w/o alcohol.  </li>
            <li> but it has a texture that is dry normally and gets frizzy without a gel or mousse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light product, and a little goes a long way especially when combined with water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick, so one or two pumps should be more than enough.</li>
            <li> So the second time I used it put it in my hair as a leave in, to moisture a week old double strand twist set that I had.</li>
            <li> African American natural hair-</li>
            <li> i am a 32 year old african american female.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/b/c hair type (if you are into the hair typing system) and my hair is forever dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps make dry hair soft.  </li>
            <li> If you are protein sensitive (your hair gets dry with protein like mine)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pretty thick and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I use this a a leave in styling creme for my infant daughter who is 9 months old with a head of short curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> but it definitely looks much better since I have been using the  Raw Shea Shampoo and Conditioner together for the past month.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way like a lot of the Shea Moisture products, I had my first bottle forever.  </li>
            <li> I did learn from the first use that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> texture is like watered down normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> Each time I was left disappointed to the point of tears, and after less than a full week, during which time my scalp actually began to itch MORE, I had to dump the bottle (and my money) into the trash.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing with the same brand, I squeeze as much of the water from my hair as I can and start applying the conditioner from the ends to the shaft (reverse what the directions suggest, only because I don&#x27;t usually condition my scalp because my hair is sort if oily to begin with).</li>
            <li> Very concentrated a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it two days in a row, and the second time I might not have rinsed it completely out, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, nor is it weighed down.</li>
            <li> But, really wanting this to work, I tried it-- on wet hair, dry hair, and in combination with other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Also it is really thick and insanely hard to get more than a sliver out of the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I do, on the other hand, have very processed thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been so dry after dyeing it, so I figured I should get a conditioner where I actually understood the ingredients!</li>
            <li> My  hair can dry out especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> After I get out of the shower I towel dry and apply the conditioner only to the roots and shaft of my hair</li>
            <li> also used it as a leave-in (put half a palm-full in) and it made my hair feel soft but</li>
            <li> My curls dry shiny &amp; bouncy, I just can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair especially during the summer season.</li>
            <li> ( hardly ever wear my real hair out)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Walgreens has for $9 most of the line, Amazon is crazy overpriced</li>
            <li> I like that it has all natural ingredients and that the creator of the product supports other women working in other countries.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes long hair</li>
            <li> and my hair is NOT soft or shiny.  </li>
            <li> I noticed minor flaking on my hair with it.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not that long.</li>
            <li> Most natural hair products I have tried leave my hair dull, dry, and difficult to manage</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way with the shea moisture line but not that little.</li>
            <li> Most of them contain coconut oil as the first or second ingredient, and my hair responds horribly to coconut oil.    </li>
            <li> I later applied the Shea Moisture Hair Elixir Restorative oil and while it made my hair look a little better--it didn&#x27;t restore it enough for me.</li>
            <li> I use it as a rinse-out conditioner, a deep conditioner( mixed with honey, castor oil, and a little coconut oil), or as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not only wondering where my $10 went, but I am dead-set against trying a single other product from the SM line.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to add moisture to my dry hair and keep it moisturised while wearing two-strand twists during the week.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like the feeling of dry hair with product film on it.</li>
            <li> Instead, it felt both dry and</li>
            <li> Dry feeling hair that almost sound/felt crunchy.  </li>
            <li> however, I didn&#x27;t put anything on my hair afterward and let it air dry to see what the consistency would be like.  </li>
            <li> I just let it air dry after I wash it.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry hair this product is for you.</li>
            <li> After I tried it as a leave in it ended up being so dry</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders to reduce my dry finger detangling time.  </li>
            <li> my hair was really  dry</li>
            <li> Works miracles on the dry bleached hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural dry hair</li>
            <li> and i can not live without it</li>
            <li> All I remember is that it was thick and highly nappy.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a single thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american female with thick, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary for me to take my twists down during the week to moisturise.  </li>
            <li> I decided to leave the conditioner in and boy is my hair dry as a broom!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse and this leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I mixed in a little rosemary and peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> , i use it daily in my gym&#x27;s steam room and after ( just a little) and it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> I am mostly writing this review because I am shocked at the price that Amazon is listing this at.  </li>
            <li> I used Shea Moistures Yucca Shampoo and Conditioner a few months back and found it to be so-so for my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no slip or moisture.</li>
            <li> The product is not as I expected.</li>
            <li> it is not necessary everyday</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because your hair needs to be WET.</li>
            <li> The next week I applied this as a base for my twists, I also used their curling souffle, and it worked so much better.</li>
            <li> I usually let my hair dry with this on and use a styling product to two strand twist my hair afterwards (like olive oil eco styler gel, I&#x27;m going to try the SM Souffle next).  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a LONG way and though I&#x27;ve had my bottle for a little over a year, I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> I typically buy my Shea Moisture products when Walgreens has a buy one, get one half off sale, which they seem to do on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque also stopped working for me.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping that over time, my scalp will be less DRY, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical yet curious about, but this was the first product I was like uh-</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling so bleh, it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized, had very little slip</li>
            <li> Other places have it for $10.</li>
            <li> Then I bought a bottle of Kinky Curly Knot Today and used that with my Miss Jessie&#x27;s and my hair was back to the way it usually looked after a wash-n-go.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why mine is yellow in color.</li>
            <li> Ive recently decided i no longer want to get perms, atleast not more than twice a year.</li>
            <li> After the hair dries it feels a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried it would be wiry and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> (I normally have dark hair), but also trying to take care of it so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into a frizzy broken mess.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse 4b/4c hair and have a hard time keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have 4b or as some might call it nappy or very kinky hair and unfortunately this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late last year and I wouldn&#x27;t trade this conditioner for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This is now a staple for my coarse, thick curly AA hair</li>
            <li> if your hair is fine/thin it will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> no more dry, brittle, crunchy hair.    </li>
            <li> I have to say I notice much less hair loss when I shampoo and brush my hair since using this.  </li>
            <li> The smell is bland which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk, which did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried again with less product and it still stunk.</li>
            <li> You can buy this product line at Target or Walgreens for half the price.</li>
            <li> am half Navajo and half &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Target always has this product for $10 or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been into the transitioning stage for about five and a half months now.  </li>
            <li> Buy for half the price on drugstore.com</li>
            <li> Also when used as a leave in it has slight hold to help maintain twists and frizz.</li>
            <li> I buy this at Walgreens as it costs soo much less there.</li>
            <li> Her hair is a frazzled, frumpled, 2yr olds mess without this conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s how I know that it was the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and NOT any of my other products.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> I have found with these products that if they have an \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell, its because the natural ingredients in the product are starting to turn bad.</li>
            <li> and it is just going to waste.  </li>
            <li> are too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have found a few products I like, others</li>
            <li> I always have to add a few drops of olive oil to bring the shine</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed, usually dry, colored, thick, and it&#x27;s hard to keep moisture.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are all natural too as I am trying to stay away from all the silicones, sulfates and other bad things for your hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my curls were SPIRALING like crazy, like they haven&#x27;t done in a LONG LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is loud, lingering, and artificial.</li>
            <li> (ill worry about the curl pattern later)  </li>
            <li> most shampoo &amp; conditioning lines contain some sort of alcohol which is horrible for my hair (yours too).  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and I am not sure</li>
            <li> The only thing I ever see wrong with this conditioner is that the spout doesnt always work so check it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> But the only size is very small, expensive, and I end up going through it in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> , I sometimes mix this with the volumizing conditioner and although I was noticing quite a bit of hair loss lately</li>
            <li> It absolutely sucks as a rinse out conditioner</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately common of all Shea Moisture products and something I truly dislike about the line.</li>
            <li> I have thick 3c/4a hair, mid-back in length.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Milk too, since I was getting consistently poor results, with undefined and limp, stringy curls with that product.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, sort of curly, sometimes frizzy, caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> However, I had to use a LOT of it since my hair is so thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on a subtle day by day basis.  </li>
            <li> I have bleached hair with fried ends which ends up being frizzy and thin and lately has lost the body and bounce it used to have.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as a rinse-out conditioner first and it was horrible this way.</li>
            <li> But thick hair needs thicker consistency!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately three months</li>
            <li> I used this with my Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and hated the results.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> I mean you would think that after coloring, you&#x27;d get the \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; feeling but the conditioner DID NOT allow it!!</li>
            <li> but then again my hair gets tangled when I shampoo because I am careless and in a rush when shampooing my scalp.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> then I realized how expensive it is on amazon.</li>

            <li> and I was so sad that I would have to cut it all off.</li>
            <li> for some reason it&#x27;s really expensive on Amazon..</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was so afraid they would stop stocking it</li>
            <li> In a desperate attempt to save my hair, I went to Walmart in search of anything that would help untangle and restore it.</li>
            <li> that i have retired Cantu&#x27;s disappointing leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> BAD MOVE.  </li>
            <li> Again I can&#x27;t even reiterate how bad the smell was.</li>

            <li> I was frustrated and thought about just perming my hair.....</li>
            <li> I used this for a no-poo co-wash yesterday, and my 2c/3a hair is shiny and bouncy, and my scalp isn&#x27;t irritated and unhappy either!  </li>
            <li> so disappointed</li>
            <li> It was CRAZY!</li>
            <li> I hate that this product doesn&#x27;t have instructions on the bottle</li>

            <li> I have bleached hair with fried ends which ends up being frizzy and thin and lately has lost the body and bounce it used to have.  I bought this at Target thinking it couldn&#x27;t be much good because it was inexpensive, I&#x27;ve spent so much money on high priced conditioners over the years I was sure only the expensive stuff would help.  I was floored when my hair turned out soft shiny and bouncy the way it used to be before I started torturing it with bleach.  I went back and bought 5 more of these I was so afraid they would stop stocking it, I sometimes mix this with the volumizing conditioner and although I was noticing quite a bit of hair loss lately I have to say I notice much less hair loss when I shampoo and brush my hair since using this.  I&#x27;d recommend this conditioner to anyone it&#x27;s the best, the very best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I used Shea Moistures Yucca Shampoo and Conditioner a few months back and found it to be so-so for my hair. After transitioning out of braids, I needed a shampoo and conditioner that felt soothing and not harsh on my sensitive scalp. I used the Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner and found it to be perfect for my hair. As the winter months progress, I dont really shampoo as often (therefore not using the Shea Butter Shampoo). I prefer to use only the Restorative Conditioner along with Kinky Curly&#x27;s condition detangler. Both products work wonders!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars :)    Love, love, love, love this conditioner.  Mild scent (even after 1 week).     I have thick 3c/4a hair, mid-back in length. For me, it doesn&#x27;t have much slip to detangle, so I use it as my leave-in. I have been looking for a product to add moisture to my dry hair and keep it moisturised while wearing two-strand twists during the week. THIS IS IT... It&#x27;s not necessary for me to take my twists down during the week to moisturise.  I just spritz lightly with an aloe vera juice/water based mixture before I leave for work. When I take them down at the end of the week to shampoo, etc, my hair still feels nice and soft... no more dry, brittle, crunchy hair.    I&#x27;m happy I took the chance and purchased this product.  IT&#x27;S A KEEPER!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners from many different product lines over the years, and this conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  I like the fact that it is a multi-use conditioner, i.e. it can be used as a rinse-out, as a mild deep conditioner, and as a leave-in.  The moisturizing properties are long-lasting, and it detangles my hair effectively. The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars. But, it doesn&#x27;t make the product unbearable for me. Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t. I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this stuff so much. It&#x27;s organic and protein free and packs a lot of moisture. I never use it as a rinse out though; always as a leave-in. This is now a staple for my coarse, thick curly AA hair and I hope for the love of god that they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/b/c hair type (if you are into the hair typing system) and my hair is forever dry.  I first used this as a rinse out conditioner and the results was so-so.  I wouldn&#x27;t swear by it&#x27;s detangling properties but then again my hair gets tangled when I shampoo because I am careless and in a rush when shampooing my scalp.  It does leave my hair moisturized and soft, so that is its redeeming qualities.  I noticed on the bottle that you can use this as a leave-in.  The next time I used this, I used it on damp hair that was fresh from a shampoo.  One squirt is enough for my hair hair, any more and it is just going to waste.  With one pump, emulsify it in your hand so it would be easier to spread.  After my hair is dried, my hair was pretty soft and had some sheen to it.  I would suggest to trying it.  I hope Shea Moisture never alters the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This conditioner rocks! I have naturally kinky hair and after being natural for 1 year, I am finding products to fit into my hair care routine. This definitely is one that is here to stay! I was first introduced to this product when I dyed my hair with the Shea Moisture Hair Color System and my hair was so soft and my curls were SO defined. I mean you would think that after coloring, you&#x27;d get the \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; feeling but the conditioner DID NOT allow it!! I decided to buy a full sized version of this and I agree it is better as a leave-in conditioner. It moisturizes very well and it gives the dullest hair sheen for days! This product is available at Walgreens for 9.99, though. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have 4b or as some might call it nappy or very kinky hair and unfortunately this product did nothing for me. It left a residue on my hands and hair. The smell is bland which I don&#x27;t mind. I had high hopes for this product but in the trash it goes. This organic trend is for the birds.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 4b/4c hair as a LIC.  I never rinse it out.  For my WashNGo, I use the shampoo of the same flavor, slather this on, detangle and the slap on some Eco Styler.  This is a no fail style for me during the week.  I often have folks stop and ask \\&quot;What do you use on your hair?\\&quot;  Well this is it! :)</li>
            <li> I loved this product! At first I was hesitate but after a few uses I fell completely in love. My hair is relaxed, usually dry, colored, thick, and it&#x27;s hard to keep moisture. Humidity completely turns my hair into mini afro-puffs. Whenever my hair gets frizzy from humidity or sweat, I use this as a leave-in conditioner on dry hair, and my hair becomes soft, smooth, and moisturized. It&#x27;s a light product, and a little goes a long way especially when combined with water. It can also be used as a conditioning lotion or a regular conditioner after shampoo. After use my hair feels fantastic and as a natural product I know it&#x27;s not killing my hair with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this Conditioner. I have fine, Caucasian, healthy, low-porosity hair and usually products with a lot of oils in them are too heavy for my hair. This stuff made my hair feel like silk. I used it like a deep treatment and left it on my hair for a while. I&#x27;ve used it two days in a row, and the second time I might not have rinsed it completely out, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, nor is it weighed down. I don&#x27;t know if it is the Shea Butter or the Argan Oil, but this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Ok let me preface this by saying I have 4a-4b hair. I hate that this product doesn&#x27;t have instructions on the bottle so you&#x27;re left fumbling around to find a routine that this works best for.  I tried using it as deep conditioner but it did nothing for my hair as a deep conditioner. So the second time I used it put it in my hair as a leave in, to moisture a week old double strand twist set that I had. NOW NOW NOW... I&#x27;d finally found my dream leave in moisturizer. I&#x27;d previously tried the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk, which did nothing for my hair. This stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this product in a spray mist for my 4b hair and it is wonderful. My hair is moisturized throughout the day. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I tried in the Shea Moisture line. I am newly natural, but I used to have mid-back length relaxed hair and have used it on both natural and relaxed hair. I love most of the Shea Moisture products that I have tried, but I was not impressed with this one. This product can be used as both a rinse-out and leave-in conditioner. I tried it as a rinse-out conditioner first and it was horrible this way. I may as well have just rinsed my hair with water. Absolutely no slip or moisture. I had to follow up with another moisturizing conditioner. Before giving up on it, I tried it as a leave-in conditioner. It works best for me this way, though I was still underwhelmed by it. It did leave my natural hair feeling moisturized at first, but once it had time to settle, my hair felt slightly dry and there was still somewhat of a film left on the surface of my hair, which I do not like. There&#x27;s nothing like the feeling of dry hair with product film on it. It was just terrible on my relaxed hair. My hair did not feel moisturized. Instead, it felt both dry and icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product last year at Target and there&#x27;s still a ton of it left. Currently, I use this only when I&#x27;ve run out of my staple leave-in, but it&#x27;s a decent replacement. It&#x27;s decent enough on my natural hair as a leave-in that I decided to keep it rather than throw it out or give it away; however, I will not be purchasing this again. I highly recommend Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk, Deep Treatment Masque (many people hate it as a deep conditioner, but just as many seem to rave about it as a leave-in), and Thickening Growth Milk as leave-ins. I have used all of these products, but the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus product is definitely my favorite. It actually absorbs into the hair and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do choose to buy this product, please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than$9.99! I&#x27;m baffled that they&#x27;re being sold for so much more than this! This product and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price. You can find them at Walgreeens and Target for $9.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: de-ionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea butter)*, Argan oil, coconut oil*, Behentrimonium chloride, essential oil blend, vegetable glycerin, emulsifying wax, sea kelp extract, Panthenol (vitamin B-5), avocado oil, Lonicera Caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese honeysuckle) flower extract, Tocopherol (vitamin E) and Daucus Carota Sativa (carrot) seed oil. *Denotes certified organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand a lot and have been using the body wash for this particular collection for around a year now. I thought the shampoo and conditioner would be just as great, but it was a little too heavy for my hair. It would be good for those with very dry hair, but leaves my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Already in love with the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo I had high hopes for this conditioner. It lived up to my expectations beautifully! It is pretty thick which is very good and it has excellent slip! I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave-in and my hair has never felt better! My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine, not a lot of shine but it definitely looks much better since I have been using the  Raw Shea Shampoo and Conditioner together for the past month. And its all Natural Organic ingredients, Organic Shea butter, sea kelp, Argan oil (which is known for its hair growing and strengthening properties) Coconut oil, Vitamin B-5, Avocado oil,Vitamin E, Carrot Seed oil, and Honeysuckle flower extract. Just amazing, I hope these products become easier to find in stores and remain at $10. Best conditioner EVER!!!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> This product has served as a great conditioner and detangler for my hair, i have 4a/b type hair so moisture is much needed, along with the shampoo this product works well on my hair and the price is great too, id definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural I have spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do. Shea Moisture products are the TRUTH. It does what it says it will do. I have been using this product for approximately three months and I love it. It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage. This Restorative Conditioning Milk as a leave in is fab. After a good wash with the Moisture Retention Shampoo the Restorative Conditioning Milk does beautifully on my hair. The moisture just stays in as I style and it keep my hair very soft. I am very pleased with Shea Moisture and will defintely support this product. I love Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product.  My hair is very thick and coarse and this leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  Its going to be a staple.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have 3c/4a hair and use the Restorative Conditioner when I do twists.  It really helps keep my hair moisturized and my curls are really defined.  I find this product works better as a leave in conditioner versus rinsing out. It&#x27;s definitely a staple for me!!</li>
            <li> Great product for 4C hair</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow, as soon as I opened the conditioner bottle I was instantly hooked, it smells soooooo good! Being that this conditioner is $9.99 at Walgreens I will purchasing it from there from now on. Also since its a more pricey conditioner I plan to only use it for deep conditioning treatments on my dry 3b hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product....i use it as a leave in conditioner, it makes my hair soft, silky and manageable. But don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive on Amazon.Other places have it for $10.</li>
            <li> So bought this product last spring on walgreens.con,Now I was looking to buy it again then I realized how expensive it is on amazon. I only paid 12 bucks for it last year on walgreens, I just checked it out on walgreens and it&#x27;s 9.99 I&#x27;m so happy I got the walgreen app on my phone to compare prices. So amazon can shove it for that high price I&#x27;m going to walgreen! Bye bye amazon!</li>
            <li> I got this to use as a leave in to try and replace my Giovanni Direct Leave-In, seeing as that product isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. So as I added to my hair, it went on smooth with a decent amount of slip. But the smell got to me. Totally made my stomach flip flop. So I figured maybe I used too much. Tried again with less product and it still stunk. I used some Curl and Shine Milk on top just to make it bearable so I could leave for work. My hair felt moisturized and healthy but the smell never truly dissipated. Cured my Hand in Hair Syndrome for the day! Unlike me, my fiance liked the smell, but too me, it smells like bad and cheap perfume. I just wound up returning it to the store and got the Curl Enhancing Smoothie. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a good leave in if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> This product was just what we were looking for and it was at a great price.  Going natural in hair products require searching for the products all over the place.  We were glad to see that this product was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this for a no-poo co-wash yesterday, and my 2c/3a hair is shiny and bouncy, and my scalp isn&#x27;t irritated and unhappy either!  Yay!  Here&#x27;s hoping that over time, my scalp will be less DRY, as well.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> Wow. Even if I am the only woman on Earth to say this, do _NOT_ waste your money on this product. I was prematurely in love with Shea Moisture, having read and watched so many excellent reviews.  Now, I&#x27;m not only wondering where my $10 went, but I am dead-set against trying a single other product from the SM line.  I&#x27;ve been Natural (yay!) for over 5 years, always with super dryness as my only concern. Being also pro-empowerment (SM asserts that our purchases support Women&#x27;s Rights) and anti-animal products, I thought my search was over.  However, as soon as my delivery arrived (I ordered through Walgreens) and I pumped a sample into my palm, I felt like I missed out on the joke: $3 Suave Naturals Conditioner has more moisture and higher quality.  But, really wanting this to work, I tried it-- on wet hair, dry hair, and in combination with other products.  Each time I was left disappointed to the point of tears, and after less than a full week, during which time my scalp actually began to itch MORE, I had to dump the bottle (and my money) into the trash.  Your money will serve you better in a purchase of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (with several dollars left over).</li>
            <li> SM not only contains behentrimonium chloride but it&#x27;s also listed as the 5th ingredient! I see a lot of reviews complaining about the smell of saying that it&#x27;s not moistuzing enough but so far nothing on this ingredient which is said to be highly toxic over .1% and very detrimental to our  environment..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed right now I don&#x27;t even know what else to say. Well just another brand going on my ban list.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, blonde hair and my daughter&#x27;s, who&#x27;s a toehead, is even finer. Her hair is a frazzled, frumpled, 2yr olds mess without this conditioner. The shampoo is also great. I use it as a leave in conditioner on an as needed basis. My daughter&#x27;s hair is smooth and sweet smelling when I remember to put it in her hair. I have found with these products that if they have an \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell, its because the natural ingredients in the product are starting to turn bad. Get a new bottle, if has a sweet, lovely smell. I get it at target.com for aprox $10 bottle.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I LOVE this line it saved my hair from dry brittle days, and i pray this company never discontinue or change their ingredients. okay on to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great as a moisturizer but i feel i get the same amount of moister from the shampoo. The most important feature i look for in a conditioner is its slip because i have thick 4a natural hair and when wash days come around I want to get all the shedding hair and tangles out easily. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I have to add EVOO or EVCO to aid with the slip. I get better slip with the same moister with my suave humectant conditioner and the price is cut in more than half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe it or not i continue to purchase this because i love the ingredients and product line so much i want to find another way to use this. I have read on other reviews that it works better as a leave in so i will try it and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Helps make dry hair soft.  Don&#x27;t use as detangler.  Doesn&#x27;t work for that.  I have long hair.  After washing, i put quarter size in hand and massage into hair.  I leave in.</li>
            <li> ....not skin color.  I see various products reviewed as if they are for one race or another, nope, it&#x27;s about one hair type or another!  This product, along with the Moisture Retention shampoo, and other Shea products, are GREAT for thick, naturally wavy/curly hair.  I&#x27;ve started to have an issue with breakage and dryness, came across these products and they are definitely helping.  Not miracle cures, not yet, but helping - some less frizz, less breakage, hair getting back to better health!  And they are CRUELTY FREE, which is also important to me.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, seriously, doesn&#x27;t leave residues and the hair look super natural and curly, my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Better price at Target.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I used it as a deep moisturizer and my hair turned out great. I mixed in a little rosemary and peppermint oil. (About 2 drops each). Please note-You can buy this product line at Target or Walgreens for half the price.</li>
            <li> makes my 4c hair happy</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. Took a while to arrive, but when it finally did, it was worth the wait. My hair had been so dry after dyeing it, so I figured I should get a conditioner where I actually understood the ingredients! My other store bought conditioners just had too many chemicals in them that didn&#x27;t make my hair shine or feel as soft as it should. I still use this conditioner after months, and since I am almost out, I will definitely restock. My hair has been so beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is great for extremely thick hair. if your hair is fine/thin it will weigh it down. But thick hair needs thicker consistency! If you have thick hair BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> omg I love this stuff and i can not live without it, i use it daily in my gym&#x27;s steam room and after ( just a little) and it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. This stuff works just OK as moisturizing my damp hair as a leave in. It absolutely sucks as a rinse out conditioner though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is loud, lingering, and artificial. This is unfortunately common of all Shea Moisture products and something I truly dislike about the line. I really can&#x27;t stand the SM yellow line&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like watered down normal conditioner. It has no slip. It retails $9.99 at Target or similar stores. It really isn&#x27;t worth the price or time.</li>
            <li> dos not make my hair crunch... nice and soft.</li>
            <li> ***************************************************EDIT**********************************************  I have stopped using this conditioner. It eventually stopped working for me. I began hating my wash-n-go&#x27;s (they were starting to get frizzy and leave my hair undefined) so I literally did a search/destroy using each product that went into my wash-n-go by itself to decipher what was going on. It was not my co-wash or my cleansing conditioner, and it wasn&#x27;t my deep conditioner. I used this with my Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and hated the results. Then I bought a bottle of Kinky Curly Knot Today and used that with my Miss Jessie&#x27;s and my hair was back to the way it usually looked after a wash-n-go.    So, that&#x27;s how I know that it was the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and NOT any of my other products.   The Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque also stopped working for me. I used it with coconut oil and my hair was so disgustingly greasy and oily that I swore never to use coconut oil or another Shea Moisture product ever again. I stopped using the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Milk too, since I was getting consistently poor results, with undefined and limp, stringy curls with that product. Once again with the Curl and Style Milk, coconut oil was high up on the ingredients list.    I have to say no to Shea Moisture products. Most of them contain coconut oil as the first or second ingredient, and my hair responds horribly to coconut oil.    So I say goodbye to Shea Moisture. One more product for the graveyard.tion of hair. Though this may seem like quite a bit, I assure you it is not. A little bit of this product goes a LONG way and though I&#x27;ve had my bottle for a little over a year, I still have plenty left. Enough to see me through the remainder of this summer at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the coconut oil? My hair seems to ignore it in this conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using this since late last year and I wouldn&#x27;t trade this conditioner for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Another thing: the conditioner pictured here is white in color, as are most of the bottles in Target where I purchase this. My original bottle has a slightly yellow-is cast but its the same product as I have checked the ingredients. I&#x27;m not sure why mine is yellow in color.**</li>
            <li> Way too strong scent. Otherwise, I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that I have to pump the bottle about 7-8 times to get enough product out. They need to invest in a better bottle. The product is not as I expected. It does condition but it&#x27;s not as great as I thought it would be. I have very dry hair especially during the summer season. I needed this to be a strong conditioner and it isn&#x27;t. My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I use other products.</li>
            <li> I had been stealing my girlfriends Shea Moisture Organic Curl enhancing smoothie (mouth full) on a subtle day by day basis.  Unfortunately, she discovered it and I had to go get my own Shea Moisture Product. In a bid to pull the ol&#x27; \\&quot;i can get my own green food\\&quot; I saw this product and decided to try it.  My  hair can dry out especially during the winter. And as I&#x27;m new to natural, my top priority at the moment is to keep it moist (ill worry about the curl pattern later)  I read the reviews before purchasing which it said this is best as a leave in . After I got it home i immediately was suspicious by the smell. Its very strong, almost like perfume , strong perfum. Ok, whatevs I think.  After trying it as a leave in, and a rinse- the result was the same. Dry feeling hair that almost sound/felt crunchy.  So , i will pick up my own SM Smoothie as the primary moisturizer (IT is AWESOME) and maaaybe try this as a rinse to see if the too work together  ...my hair is 4a with some patches of 4b if that is relevant to the convo...  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for not only African American Hair!  Im Caucasian and most shampoo &amp; conditioning lines contain some sort of alcohol which is horrible for my hair (yours too).  I used KISS MY FACE for years but they started adding alcohol for longer shelf life.  BAD MOVE.  So it took me about a year to find a new product.  IM HOOKED!  Love this one, love the Coconut line, etc.  My hair stopped breaking, stopped being hard, and eventually (about a year) came back to a nice, soft, supple feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is all natural, which it is VERY VERY hard to find true all natural stuff w/o alcohol.  Thanks Shae Moisture.  OH, you have to read their story, its great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walgreens has for $9 most of the line, Amazon is crazy overpriced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review in my life, but I love this product so much that I think it&#x27;s worth writing about.&lt;br /&gt;I am half Navajo and half &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;. I have long thick hair that touches the top of my butt. (Just as a background).&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stayed with a friend and used her shampoo for &amp;#34;thin hair&amp;#34;. It turned my entire head of hair into one big dread lock!!!! I couldn&#x27;t comb through it for WEEKS!!!!!! My husband likes long hair and I&#x27;ve always liked my hair and I was so sad that I would have to cut it all off. So I decided to try to brush through it (from bottom to top) as much as I could no matter how much it messed up my hair. I brushed and brushed and it broke a lot of my hair into pieces! AND I STILL COULDN&#x27;T BRUSH THROUGH THE WHOLE THING! In a desperate attempt to save my hair, I went to Walmart in search of anything that would help untangle and restore it. (Before that, at home I tried a avocado, mayo, egg mask and all it did was get stuck inside the dread). I search the regular isle of shampoos and conditioners in search of anything without alcohol. I couldn&#x27;t find a single thing. In the next isle was a section for &amp;#34;ethnic hair&amp;#34;. I looked around and found this conditioner and the shampoo. Took them both home and THAT SAME NIGHT MY HAIR COMPLETELY DETANGLED!!!!!! I almost cried I was so happy and relieved. I had so much hair that had fallen out and was stuck in the big dread and this got it all out, smoothed it and completely detangled it all. I think there is somewhat of a learning curve though. After shampooing with the same brand, I squeeze as much of the water from my hair as I can and start applying the conditioner from the ends to the shaft (reverse what the directions suggest, only because I don&#x27;t usually condition my scalp because my hair is sort if oily to begin with). I let it sit while I scrub by body, face, shave, etc... then rinse. After I get out of the shower I towel dry and apply the conditioner only to the roots and shaft of my hair (I use a full pump since I have so much hair) and I&#x27;m done! My hair is more luxurious than it&#x27;s ever been. I am so grateful to this product and what it&#x27;s done for me. Thank you thank you thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Ok- so I was happy with this conditioner after I rinsed my hair in that it was still soft-- however, I didn&#x27;t put anything on my hair afterward and let it air dry to see what the consistency would be like.  Well it remained soft and tangle free but boy was it dry and  fly away at the roots  (the relaxed ends looked silky and great but the roots and new growth--not so much)  I kind of expected more.  I later applied the Shea Moisture Hair Elixir Restorative oil and while it made my hair look a little better--it didn&#x27;t restore it enough for me.</li>
            <li> love the pump top! i wish all shampoo and conditioner was sold like this</li>
            <li> I have really thick, sort of curly, sometimes frizzy, caucasian hair. My daughter&#x27;s is even thicker and can be really frizzy. She has been really frustrated with her hair. We are both using this product as a leave-in conditioner. It is so wonderful. My daughters hair is frizz free, silky and soft. She is so happy with it. This is the best product we have ever tried and is 1/3 the price of other salon products we&#x27;ve tried(if you purchase it elsewhere.. for some reason it&#x27;s really expensive on Amazon.. hopefully they will fix that).&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t wait to try more Shea Moisture products at our house.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It smells great and adds great shine to my hair without leaving it greasy. I always wash it out even though it says it can be used as a leave in conditioner as well, but I live in a humid climate and don&#x27;t need the additional moisture. I use the baby shampoo for myself rather than the regular shampoo as I have very fine, fragile hair and I love that it cleans my hair without stripping it and is also very gentle on sensitive skin. My hair stylist can&#x27;t get over how full and healthy my hair has been since I started using this product. Most natural hair products I have tried leave my hair dull, dry, and difficult to manage and I love that with this brand I don&#x27;t have to sacrifice beautiful hair for healthy products!</li>
            <li> Ive recently decided i no longer want to get perms, atleast not more than twice a year. i am a 32 year old african american female.  I mostly wear my hair in twists or weaves ( hardly ever wear my real hair out) because i had breakage at the nape of my hair and it has gotten shorter over the years.  After taking out my weaves this summer, I had very coarse hair, unmanageable hair and couldn&#x27;t figure out what product to use to get in smooth again......  I used morrocan oil as a leave in, had gone to a  dominican salon to  blow me out, had my hair pressed,  and still could nt get a comb through it!!  I was frustrated and thought about just perming my hair.....Then I started looking on here and re-searching natural hair and realized the number one thing natural hair needs....MOISTURE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I then researched moisturing products with the best reviews and came upon Shea Moisture products...The reviews seemed excellent so i bought the moisture retention shampoo and restorative conditioner, using the conditioner as both a leave in and deep conditioner  and omg ..AMAZING! I fell in love after the first use and I will be using the products for now on.....it instantly gave my hair and scalp moisture and softness and i could feel it less coarse and more smooth than before......I will continue to use this product bi-weekly!.. , after trying so many products...Shea Moisture is the best thing ever!!!!! especially for transitioning to natural hair!!! I will be buying the deep treatment mask as well and try it as a daily styling cream or maybe a deep conditioner as well....</li>
            <li> I have relaxed 4b/4c hair type. I fell in love with shea moisture after the first wash. The shampoo that goes with this conditioner left my hair soft and easy to detangle in the shower with the least amount of effort. Then I deep conditioned with this and was in awe at how it made my hair go from soft as silk to \\&quot;meh\\&quot;. It really does nothing for my hair and I&#x27;m usually better off washing with the shampoo and skipping this conditioner altogether. Instead I use a little cantu leave in or just apply some light coconut oil. Also it is really thick and insanely hard to get more than a sliver out of the pump bottle. A little really does go a long way with the shea moisture line but not that little. I constantly had to twist off the pump to get anything out. Also the shea moisture line is sold in stores and on their respective websites (walgreens and target) for 9.99, so don&#x27;t let them price gouge you here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months (I have short, fine, natural african american hair). I spied it at the store and the fact that it is supposed to be all natural seemed great.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the first day I used it I HATED the smell. Imagine a person who has used way too much perfume. I used it again though and over time got used to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thicker and growing much more in my opinion. I use this when I am styling my hair (twists) or when I just need to moisturize it. I recommend squirting it into your hand and rubbing it around first so it&#x27;s not just a big white glob.&lt;br /&gt;I never wash this out when I use it. I use it like a daily moisturizer and my hair feels great. It&#x27;s still dry (which is the nature of most people&#x27;s natural black hair), but it&#x27;s growing and getting better!</li>
            <li> This product is really good for curly hair.  I used it as a wash out conditioner and about a dime size amount for leave in.  It made my hair really soft and it smells really good like vanilla cake frosting.  I like that it has all natural ingredients and that the creator of the product supports other women working in other countries.  My hair is curly and I am not sure what category it falls into as I am caucasion but it has a texture that is dry normally and gets frizzy without a gel or mousse.  It has curls that are S shaped and grows in straight but curls on the ends.  It is not thick but medium (between fine and thick).  I also color my hair but don&#x27;t use a blow dryer or any appliances on my hair I just let it air dry after I wash it.  I think this is the best product I have used of all the ones I have reviewed or purchased thus far.  If you are protein sensitive (your hair gets dry with protein like mine) this product doesn&#x27;t have protein either.  Also, the price of it doesn&#x27;t break the bank too and you can get it on Amazon or at the local drugstore (Walgreens and CVS have it).  The ingredients in this product are all natural too as I am trying to stay away from all the silicones, sulfates and other bad things for your hair and skin.  I also have a very sensitive scalp and this product hasn&#x27;t irritated it.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s only 9.99 at target and 10.99 at CVS don&#x27;t buy online here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve used the shampoo alone and just using that my hair feels so soft i&#x27;m planning on trying it with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> best product i had ever tryed, it makes my hair so soft an manageable give this one a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair and I have to say that I absolutely love this product as a conditioner, and I usually leave some in my hair purposely. It is rich, moisturizing, and it smells great. Also, it is NOT pricey--you can buy it at Target or Walgreens for $9.99, and I love that it is all natural. I am a bigger fan of this conditioner than the shampoo in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really really love this conditioner. I have coarse 4b/4c hair and have a hard time keeping it moisturized. I discovered this hair care line after reading a natural hair care book. And, I am so grateful I found it. This conditioner is pretty thick and has all natural ingredients. There are no parabens, no silicones, and plenty of natural oils to help nurse hair back to health or maintain a healthy hair care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using it as a leave-in and a styling agent. My hair loves it! I would definitely recommend it for those who want to lose the chemicals, get back to basics, and purchase high quality items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of getting a deal, I would recommend keeping an eye on sales at Walgreen&#x27;s and Target. They often have buy one, get one free deals. This price is a joke. Target always has this product for $10 or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been into the transitioning stage for about five and a half months now.  My hair&#x27;s been relaxed for over 20 years so I forgot what grade my natural hair was.  All I remember is that it was thick and highly nappy.  Since my transitioning I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural ingredients for my hair such as shampoos, conditioners, and moisturizers are concerned.  Shea butter is on every transitioning person&#x27;s list and I tried it and my hair&#x27;s not there yet so I&#x27;m still experimenting.  I have the curly &amp; shine kit and wasn&#x27;t digging the shampoo.  The mist is awesome.  I figured I need something else.  My hair has taken well to the transitioning but it&#x27;s a bit damaged around my edges so I tried the moisture retention shampoo.  I can&#x27;t tell if it did anything.  This restorative conditioner is awesome as far as detangling my new growth which is naturally curly.  I decided to leave the conditioner in and boy is my hair dry as a broom!  The scent is nauseating and strong.  It&#x27;s got a waxy feel to it and my hair is NOT soft or shiny.  It&#x27;s dry and dull.  I had to resort to using my homemade moisturizing spritz that&#x27;s not holding up because of this leave in conditioner.  Next time when I wash my hair I will be rinsing this stuff out and going to my hibiscus mist and homemade moisturizing spray because this conditioner so far, is a no go for my first time use.</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter shampoo so when they came out with the conditioner, I got excited....didn&#x27;t last. It left my hair feeling so bleh, it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized, had very little slip and I had to use more than necessary to coat my thick hair. I do enjoy the thickness of the conditioner and the smell lingered on my hair strands but other than that, I felt I had a dud on my hands. Until I read here it works good as a leave in. The next week I applied this as a base for my twists, I also used their curling souffle, and it worked so much better. A week later, my hair is moisturized, soft, with a natural shine to it. As a leave in, this works just as good as Giovanni direct leave in which I love. I will try it a few more times to see if I can justify buying it over again since I can buy 2 giovanni bottles for the same cost. FYI, this only costs $9.99 in target and walgreens ;)</li>
            <li> This has a bit of a perfume smell but it&#x27;s not bad.  It is also in the low toxic range. You can use a ton of the stuff without any buildup or greasy feeling.  After the hair dries it feels a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I do not have ethnic hair.  I do, on the other hand, have very processed thin straight hair.  I&#x27;ve been bleaching it (I normally have dark hair), but also trying to take care of it so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into a frizzy broken mess.  This conditioner is AMAZING!  I only put conditioner on my bottom 3/4 (my hair dresser said to never put conditioner on the roots), and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is all the way to the tip!  I truly believe that this line can be for any hair type.  Yay!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, long hair (just below my bust) and this product smells wonderful in my hair. I used it in the shower as a rinse-out and it felt so silky as I was rinsing it. However, I had to use a LOT of it since my hair is so thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it as a leave-in (put half a palm-full in) and it made my hair feel soft but the only problem with using products that soften my hair too much is that I always have to put a curl-defining pudding or creme into my hair in order to define my curl. Otherwise this product straightens out my curl.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. My hair is smooth and shiny. I have tried many sulfate free conditioner&#x27;s and this is by far the best. If you have dry hair this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went natural about a month ago, it&#x27;s been an interesting journey in regards to my hair routine. I have found a few products I like, others I&#x27;m skeptical yet curious about, but this was the first product I was like uh-uh, you go back as SOON as possible. I know what Shea Butter smells and feels like. The smell from this product was just ugh....and the texture on my hair after applying was just a no-go.  After I tried it as a leave in it ended up being so dry I noticed minor flaking on my hair with it. Again I can&#x27;t even reiterate how bad the smell was. I washed it out that evening and returned it the next day. So...as of right now the only main products that I&#x27;m enjoying are Design Essentials - the Natural line and Trader Joe Products.</li>
            <li> it is good if you are experiment some breakage in your hair. natural 3c hair</li>
            <li> Love it as a leave in after wash and condition especially seal with oil and use with my flexi rod set and my hair stays shiny and moisturized for days!</li>
            <li> I am mostly writing this review because I am shocked at the price that Amazon is listing this at.  You can find this in almost any story for right around $10.00, often less than that price. I typically buy my Shea Moisture products when Walgreens has a buy one, get one half off sale, which they seem to do on a regular basis. I am not sure how they are justifying adding in almost seven (7) more dollars for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, this is a wonderful product although I do not use it as a rinsing conditioner and use it exclusively as a leave in conditioner.  I am able to use it in my hair and my kids as well.  I have wavy hair and both of my kids have lovely kinky curls, and it is great to use daily on my son&#x27;s curls, which tend to be drier.  His curls stay healthy using this as a daily moisturizer. Yet, it is light enough that it can be used in different textures. In general, I have found that Shea Moisture products are really great once you figure out how to use them on your particular hair. I also love that they are so affordable, though you would not guess it from the price being listed here.</li>
            <li> Buy for half the price on drugstore.com I don&#x27;t know why it is doubled on here. The product is great for my 4C hair</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product during my transition period (of going natural) I was not all that impressed. Now that I am two years plus being natural this stuff is amazing on my coarse naturally curly 4a,b,c,z  hair. I mainly use it as a leave in and also to dry finger detangle my hair. This product has done wonders to reduce my dry finger detangling time.  Also when used as a leave in it has slight hold to help maintain twists and frizz. I have used many products in this line and really you can&#x27;t go wrong with trying this particular product and the many other products Shea moisture supplies.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great as a leave in conditioner! I have 4a type hair and this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair (Shea Moisture&#x27;s Leave-In conditioner is very good too). I can not recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> This was great at first. It made my hair feel moisture n soft but couple hours later. my hair was really  dry n made it feel like I put hair gel in it...I have not found that amazing product for my hair yet....I have course curly hair....</li>
            <li> I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; frizzy, highly porous hair that has begun thinning. I&#x27;ve done ALOT of research - hopefully it helps you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing with Shea moisture shampoo my hair IMMEDIATELY felt thicker, even in the shower! It was CRAZY! I then conditioned with this product and it appeared to do the trick right away, I could tell it was really moisturizing! My hair felt different as I rinsed it, not as \\&quot;coated\\&quot; - so I was a bit worried. BUT THERE WAS NO NEED TO WORRY -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&gt;BECAUSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took the towel off of my head I noticed that my curls were SPIRALING like crazy, like they haven&#x27;t done in a LONG LONG TIME!!! Don&#x27;t know if it was from the &#x27;poo or conditioner, but something/or combo of both work GREAT. (BTW - I never never rub with the towel, only pat - helps avoid frizz.)I cannot believe my hair is shiny again, and looks healthy after just ONE USE of these products! I can&#x27;t wait to try again. I will review the \\&quot;milk\\&quot; leave in as well. I&#x27;m very excited about these products :)&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless :)</li>
            <li> I buy this at Walgreens as it costs soo much less there. I have African American natural hair- no idea of the type a/b etc. but this conditioner is great on my hair&lt;br /&gt;I use it only as a leave in and it detangles my hair and makes it super soft. I LOVE that there is no build up. I coo wash then I use this to twist my hair and put it into bantu knots&lt;br /&gt;after it dries I twist out and just use the conditioner as a daily touch up. it is not necessary everyday but i just love how it makes my hair feel&lt;br /&gt;it works great for my hair to  detangle and add lasting softness</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and detangles well. I bought this along with the shampoo and hair milk. These products work well together.</li>
            <li> Best for use on my 3b hair texture after co washing. It moisturizes and smells great without weighing the hair down.This is my go to leave in now that i have retired Cantu&#x27;s disappointing leave in conditioners. But buy this from Walmart where its only like 9 bucks.</li>
            <li> I prefer leave-in conditioners versus the rinse out ones. I first saw the Shea Moisture products in Target. With the very first application, I was pleased with the results. This conditioner leaves my locks soft and moisturized with no greasy buildup or dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now and I love it.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine rinsing all that goodness away after a wash so I use it as a leave in. I love how soft and moisturized it makes my hair feel. I usually let my hair dry with this on and use a styling product to two strand twist my hair afterwards (like olive oil eco styler gel, I&#x27;m going to try the SM Souffle next).  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  A little goes a long way like a lot of the Shea Moisture products, I had my first bottle forever.  I hear this is tougher to find, like you can&#x27;t get it at CVS and Walgreens, but Target has it.</li>
            <li> Love it! I needed a conditioner that could help to treat and restore my breaking hair and this product helps. The smell is ok. I leave in my hair for 5 mins and it works fine</li>
            <li> As close to Wen (and I have tried Wen products) as you can get at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It works great for my kinky-coily textured hair. It is very moisturizing and I will definitely purchase more when I am done with this bottle. I did learn from the first use that a little bit goes a long way. Its smell is nice, but it is also pretty strong when a lot is used.</li>
            <li> Works miracles on the dry bleached hair. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;Completely chemical free since 4/10/09&lt;br /&gt;APL, S-curls that coil at the ends&lt;br /&gt;Natural dry hair&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was one of those curlies who thought that this conditioner is only better as a leave-in. Boy, was I wrong! It is great as a leave-in but its also great as a rinse out conditioner. It may not have slip to many curlies with type 4 hair (if you&#x27;re in to hair typing) but that&#x27;s because your hair needs to be WET. I apply the product to soaking wet hair and smooth it in. I add a little more water and a small amount of it again and viola! slip! It has amazing slippage! Detangling is a breeze! My curls pop instantly and my hair is VERY defined and moisturize. Did I say MOISTURIZED? Now, I will admit, once you rinse it out, it can be a bit stiff but trust me when I say, my hair was super soft, detangled, and moisturized like nobody&#x27;s business! I use the product as a leave-in and it&#x27;s wonderful. I would suggest giving this product another chance as a rinse out. This and the deep treatment masque (which is great as a deep conditioner, not just leave-in) are permanent staples in my hair regimen. I hope this helps, ladies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american female with thick, relaxed hair. I have been using this shampoo for a couple of months and I have been fairly pleased with the results. It&#x27;s VERY thick, so one or two pumps should be more than enough. It smells amazing and light and coats and cling to my hair, root to tip. While I normally rinse it out all out, the last time I washed my hair I used it as a leave in conditioner. Be fair warned, if you leave it in as a conditioner it stays on thick in your hair, and it takes a longer time to blow dry. I find that that once I&#x27;m done drying, my hair is very soft, and bouncy. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny at all, however. That would be my only complaint. I always have to add a few drops of olive oil to bring the shine back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this conditioner only boasts natural ingredients, is sulfate free, and has argon oil in it among other things. It&#x27;s pricey, but it will last a long time so it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, but I liked the shampoo better. Still great though. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this a a leave in styling creme for my infant daughter who is 9 months old with a head of short curly dry hair. It leaves perfectly defined curls that are soft to the touch with a bit of sheen, and doesn&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin/scalp at all. Love that the ingredients are all natural. Before this I was using aloe gel but it made her curls crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my hair with good results too but I much prefer it on her hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li> Love using this on my long hair! Gives great moisture, especially when you have your hair color treated like mine. Left my hair feeling shiny, healthy, and manageable! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair feels so clean &amp; moisturized. My curls dry shiny &amp; bouncy, I just can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for my hair. But the only size is very small, expensive, and I end up going through it in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month. Makes your hair very soft. I also have senstive scalp and this calms the itch. I love the fact that it is more natural than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner. I have low porosity 4a natural hair. When I first went natural I tried all the mainstream hyped up products and none of them worked on my hair. Once my hair dried it would be wiry and extremely dry. After doing some research I decided to try this conditioner out. As soom as I put in in my hair curls started to pop up that I had never seen before because of the dryness(this product does not create curls) and my hair felt very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in many different ways. I use it as a rinse-out conditioner, a deep conditioner( mixed with honey, castor oil, and a little coconut oil), or as a leave in. The only thing I ever see wrong with this conditioner is that the spout doesnt always work so check it before you buy it. Shea Moisture should also think about making it into a bigger value size because I run through it easily and my hair is not that long.</li>
