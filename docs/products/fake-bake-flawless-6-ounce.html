            <li>I get the best brown tan like I used to get when I tanned in the tanning bed but without the damage to my skin and fear of cancer recurrence.</li>
            <li>Best tanning I have used!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed how evenly it applies.</li>
            <li>Great color!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect tan, and lessening my risk of skin cancer, it&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
            <li>But the color is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Best at home tanner</li>
            <li>but I feel this product by itself would not have been excellent</li>
            <li>Perfect tan!</li>
            <li>It goes on great and does not leave you streaky!</li>
            <li>Great suggestion!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect for touch ups.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>and it worked perfectly.</li>

            <li>The color is perfect for me.</li>

            <li>This is the perfect self-tanner for those who are scared of that horrid orange color.</li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>and it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li>It works best when you apply at night, after showering, then rinse in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My sister was so impressed with my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that she ordered it too.</li>

            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one for years and have always had great results.  </li>
            <li>The product is great but the mit gets worn out.</li>

            <li>and I was happy with the results.</li>

            <li>it out, great product.</li>
            <li>Great self tanner.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, however, the bottle is defective.</li>
            <li>The color is great but it does wear on the sheets.</li>
            <li>things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let these things deter you from buying because this product is great</li>
            <li>So I just rely in my makeup to match my body, and that works great.</li>
            <li>The color is great.</li>
            <li>I used the Xen Tan balm on my elbows/knees/feet/hands as someone recommended in a review and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Also it does give a great color.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>Gives me great color and no streaking.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the great  reviews.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to sun.</li>
            <li>The color is really great though.</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>It looks great.  </li>
            <li>If I do, that&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me orange and they provide a mitt which is great and helps prevent a streaking effect that can happen without a mitt or sponge.  </li>
            <li>Still a great product</li>
            <li>The color guard is GREAT.</li>
            <li>Also a lot of people said that you need to shower the morning after applying because of the color guard, well i dont shower after and it works great and doesnt rub off</li>
            <li>The price is great too.</li>
            <li>Great non-orange color.</li>
            <li>The mitt is great for applying evenly.</li>
            <li>Great self tanner.</li>
            <li>I was watching some reviews online and this girl named Steph,@ SMLx0 on youtube did a great review and demo of this product.</li>
            <li>and it didnt work on my face that great.</li>
            <li>as though I&#x27;ve had a great time out in the sun over the weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not paid by this company to write a great review.  </li>
            <li>This worked great.  </li>
            <li>It has great coverage and you have a lot of control over where it goes.  </li>
            <li>Besides the nice looking tan you get, one of the best perks is saving a hundred bucks a month from the tanning salons and risking melanoma..</li>
            <li>Almost like chocolate (khalua or mudslide😋) color guard is great</li>
            <li>Great self tanner.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>in the morning when I woke up the tan looked great.</li>
            <li>It does give you a darker color and the glove is great for applying it evenly.</li>
            <li>Works great...</li>
            <li>Great self tanner.</li>
            <li>I acheived great color on my face and legs.  </li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>(great)</li>
            <li>product has a great smell, it smells  like</li>
            <li>the mitt works great</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great if I forget or don&#x27;t have time to apply my Million Dollar Tan the night before.  </li>
            <li>this product is great in terms of it does not streak or become blotchy.</li>
            <li>Smells great going on,its been about 5 hou7</li>
            <li>Looks great, no streaks.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to sitting in a tanning bed and risking cancer.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this tanner was the lack of DHA smell, instead, it has a nice coconut smell when applying and after washing off the color gaurd</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great...</li>
            <li>Some reason it was great until I got to my chest.</li>
            <li>I am about as experienced with sunless tanners as a consumer could be.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The mit is great.</li>

            <li>I achieved the level I was happy with, but after 3 days of not applying, color was fading fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I have never been so happy with a self tanner.</li>

            <li>Invest in a better one and you will be happy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice as a bronzer on the face if you&#x27;re going out or something!</li>
            <li>It took about 3 applications for me to successfully have covered without leaving lighter spots.</li>
            <li>Love it best tan product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice!</li>

            <li>Quite nicely!</li>
            <li>I love the immediate color it gives you as a guide it makes it perfect to throw on on the go for those days</li>
            <li>, I look like I have a perfect line free tan!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful but also make sure you trim the tub that goes in it to the correct length</li>
            <li>So I was in the market for a good self-tanner, and I decided to buy this one based on all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>After so many years of searching we found the perfect one!!!!!</li>
            <li>The liquid develops into a wonderful brown (not orange!) color, and it was even and believable.</li>

            <li>Love the wonderful fragrance....</li>
            <li>I think the best way to use it is put it on at night before bed then wash in shower in morning to have it blend better.</li>
            <li>Perfect :-)</li>
            <li>not so great for fair blondes.</li>
            <li>This worked better lol!  </li>
            <li>Love the mit and how flawlessly it goes on.</li>

            <li>NICE COLOR!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skin and it looked great.</li>

            <li>Great product, fair price</li>
            <li>flawless seemed to be the most feasible for the effort I wanted to put in to getting some color on my skin.</li>
            <li>It came with gloves and a really nice mitt!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ised many self tanners and this one is great!</li>

            <li>DOES SMELL NICE!</li>
            <li>am trying on wedding dresses tomorrow and needed something to cover up the KP, so I researched all over for the perfect &amp;#34;tanning solution&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>be sure to take a bath, and exfoliate really good all over!!</li>

            <li>honestly it smells amazing, perfect color, arrived before the estimated date (pinnacle supply)</li>

            <li>Great price, smells wonderful, really easy to use and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The tropical, coconutty scent was pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell,  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The pleasant coconut smell had been replaced by that signature I&#x27;ve been using self tanner smell, but not the strongest I&#x27;ve smelled compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>The scent from this product, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t overpowering either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It had a pleasant smell and wasn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make me orange and had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li>-It has a pleasant smell.    </li>
            <li>With this product the results are incredible well and very easy to use and to spread on the body using the gloves that comes with it.</li>
            <li>it leaves a very nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use!!  </li>
            <li>The best part is that the product delivers a true &#x27;tan&#x27; color with no orange!</li>

            <li>Although tanwise lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t wash off in the shower as easy, FakeBake is literally the best tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and the easy way to apply is just the best.  </li>
            <li>The girl made it look sooooo easy and the color she turned was a gorgeous tan!!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply and dries fast.the best part is that you wash it off after 60 minutes, which means your bedding doesn&#x27;t turn brown!  </li>

            <li>I love all their products but flawless is my favorite!</li>
            <li>The color guard was awesome, however it settled in every fine line I have.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a quick Homecoming tan!</li>
            <li>It also smells VERY good, compared to most self tanners.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use !</li>
            <li>Also, it is very easy to wash!</li>
            <li>it comes with latex gloves and a mitt, it&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>

            <li>Gives me a perfect, flawless, natural looking tan without the harmfulness of a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It is the best most effective self tanner i have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>You will look amazing with a great tan.</li>
            <li>I should have known better then try another kind when the one I already use works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t in good conscience knowing they are misleading consumers.</li>
            <li>I have fair, fair skin and need something to take the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; away.  </li>
            <li>I loved it 👌</li>
            <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good size bottle.</li>
            <li>Then the tan is good for about five days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who has stayed away from tanning because of my fair skin.</li>
            <li>this has a great smell, looks nice, but you have to put it on every day.</li>
            <li>Color is good but washes off.</li>
            <li>So it may be good for people wanting a boost to there already tan skin.</li>
            <li>I would say this is good to wear if you are in a pinch and need some color for a weekend event, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a problem finding a good self tanner because all the lotions tend to clog my pores and break me out.</li>
            <li>The color is good for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, also.  </li>
            <li>This worked good in the beginning now</li>
            <li>If you want this to look good you should expect to take your time applying it.</li>
            <li>and I already have good color.</li>
            <li>Color builds gradually, which in my opinion is good, because if you do goof up, it won&#x27;t stand out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo good though...</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>It does look good on my medium skin tone, though.</li>
            <li>Always good.</li>
            <li>But once i got it and tried it, i loved it.</li>
            <li>Good color and coverage.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff, I bought this because I will be in a wedding on December 15th.</li>
            <li>So I bought this on recommendation from my girlfriend, and it works really really good.</li>
            <li>The product itself is just fair.</li>
            <li>but I do agree that this one has a good color.</li>
            <li>I put it on after showering in the morning, and through out the day had gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Yes, using this product gives you an all-over immediate tan, but if you wear it to bed as people state, then it doesn&#x27;t even help you look good (while you sleep?</li>
            <li>Gives you good color in a hurry</li>
            <li>When I wake up the color is good, then I take a shower and all the color washes off.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>it seems to remove from hands good.</li>
            <li>looks gorgeous from the minute you apply it, no waiting to see how it came out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be good for another two days</li>
            <li>It works great, nice even tan...</li>
            <li>Good building tan.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I also have to use a good face wash or my face will break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product, but I haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s the answer for me yet.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great for fair complexions</li>
            <li>Every time I put it on around my boyfriend, he tells me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if your on a budget and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to reiterate all of the good comments and tanning tips.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good on the legs.</li>
            <li>It looks good when you apply it, but when you shower, the majority of it washes off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly fair</li>
            <li>and I was worried that I would never find a self tanner that could make me look as good as the beds do.....</li>
            <li>Works SOOO good, you have to have time to do this.</li>
            <li>Now remind you, I&#x27;m fair skinned...not</li>
            <li>The color of this tanner is fantastic, and the mitt that comes with it gives flawless application.</li>
            <li>being that I am quite fair skinned,</li>
            <li>Definately good</li>
            <li>but Tanwise from Sally is just as good and cheaper</li>
            <li>Great way to get nice even color.  </li>
            <li>The tan is as good as the custom spray tans I have gotten at the salon for $50 per session.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>It spreads evenly and nicely without streaking and the color it gives is great.</li>
            <li>Good color</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Good question, that instruction was not include on how to use the mitt.</li>
            <li>but i saw immediate color and loved the smell</li>
            <li>It looks so good.</li>
            <li>really good price also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m a teenager with fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no St. Tropez but fairly close.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate and shave before applying and the color looks good</li>
            <li>and I also tried SunLabs because I also heard some good things</li>
            <li>The good news though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain...</li>
            <li>this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>In all fairness I am extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Smells great, tropical kind of like coconut.</li>
            <li>You will get a fair amount of color washing off, but you will still be tan.</li>
            <li>Then it will come out good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair</li>
            <li>I loved it..</li>
            <li>Works well gives good color</li>
            <li>smellls good and gives you a temporary tan, but I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skin</li>

            <li>the color is good................</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned.</li>
            <li>any good pessimist, however, I&#x27;ve found a couple of flaws, and offer them here as a buyer beware.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good</li>
            <li>One good quality this product had was the smell.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night, then shower in the morning &amp; am good to go.  </li>
            <li>Being a redhead Ive been searching for years to find a good self tanner, one that doesn&#x27;t leave me orange or glittery.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of self tanner and saw that this one got a lot of good feedback</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I know others have posted some good reviews.</li>
            <li>As good as advertised.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>YouTube has good vids on how to put it on.  </li>
            <li>so I would look good at the pool...</li>
            <li>what island I escaped to, but I just laughed and then told them about this</li>
            <li>(I can never get them to tan, even after weeks in a bed with good lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and</li>
            <li>Two coats was good for me.</li>
            <li>, it does a good job of spreading everything evenly.</li>
            <li>I do not have a lot of experience with self tanners, but I still know what looks good and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>The mitt is good because you can blend</li>
            <li>Because i have fair skin</li>
            <li>I also loved that it came with the applying glove.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered ontime and in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color came out fairly evenly.</li>
            <li>Good medium darkness after one application.</li>
            <li>i loved it,</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have not noticed any orange tones.  </li>
            <li>so i am as fair skinned as it gets,  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I would use it in the morning and walk out of the house and people loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I have fair freckle skin, it tans but does not look orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and brown.</li>
            <li>They never did their job as good as this product.</li>
            <li>im fair skinned</li>
            <li>This stuff is just superior.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you want some color before going out</li>
            <li>am thrilled at the purchase and happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>and you can never truly blend it even when expoliating, its good for day</li>
            <li>and it smells good during application.&lt;br /&gt;Besides</li>
            <li>It was a good item for the price, except for my hands, I like that the tanning mitt does a good job of minimum streaks on the body.</li>
            <li>I just got this item with good</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product, but just did not work for me...</li>
            <li>I tried this item today and loved it.  </li>
            <li>, product dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Good value for quality of the product-</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want good</li>
            <li>Good product to have without a risk of getting a skin cancer and cost cheaper than go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Would be good for a one time event I guess...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>As good as home-self-applied fake-tanner can be...</li>
            <li>It does work good</li>
            <li>Still cannot perfect the streak free look</li>
            <li>Good smell though...</li>
            <li>good smell.</li>
            <li>and I dont think it is nearly as good as this one is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay over $100 for a product this good.</li>
            <li>Though I assume it would look good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a tropical smell as its so good</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel like that which is good.</li>
            <li>Good luck, men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo good though...</li>
            <li>I have used it three times-two days apart each time-and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t say this too lightly when I say this is the best self-tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin w/ freckles</li>
            <li>but he thinks this looks really good and encourages me to use it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>If you want the perfect tan, get the product, read the instructions in Glynis Ewing&#x27;s review here on Amazon and you will get fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Good for mistakes.</li>
            <li>Good for mistakes.</li>
            <li>I have even applied this before and while at the beach with good results.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>It gives a really good color though.</li>
            <li>I am so fair skinned and have skin cancer also</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with the good characteristics.</li>
            <li>Even with a good applicator, it will make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried it it takes alot of reapplications to get a good brown color...</li>
            <li>Good tanner.  </li>
            <li>I squirt it on my hands, apply it to my face and it looks really good.  </li>
            <li>And it lasts a good week or until I do another exfoliate and shave again.</li>
            <li>but you have to rub it in really good</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was the highest rated by users on Amazon, and had some good, in-depth reviews.</li>
            <li>Over all, product works good.</li>
            <li>Good (Almond,</li>
            <li>Good Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 52 with fair skin.</li>
            <li>Already I was looking good.</li>
            <li>And just in case you are wondering, I was NOT paid to give a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I lather up my body really good twice with my soap..</li>
            <li>Once you get good at applying it, no one can tell it is not a sun tan.  </li>
            <li>and it works good.</li>
            <li>All good things but</li>
            <li>It also has a fairly good staying power.</li>
            <li>girls and I like this because the color is good, not so orangey and fake.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I apply at night after bathing and exfoliating my skin really good and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li>Also the color looks really good.</li>
            <li>It also is a good color, not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This gives a progressively gradual color and makes me feel good about myself.  </li>
            <li>I washed the mitten after use, and it stays good.  </li>
            <li>Smell was good too...</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned redhead who dreams of being tan.</li>
            <li>, I am fair with freckles and when i got done using it</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s a good product too.</li>
            <li>I really loved this self tanner.</li>
            <li>and that I can get a good tan without risking cancer in tanning beds.</li>
            <li>but the over all product is  good</li>
            <li>I bought this produced because it had good reviews</li>
            <li>The applicator is good for maybe one or two applications.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and freckles and do not like to tan but was going to Disney World</li>
            <li>i ordered this product for my redhaired fair skinned daughter.</li>
            <li>I had read that people with fair skin had good luck, but not for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im naturally fair skinned, but tan well.</li>
            <li>It gives good color</li>
            <li>so this is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>a good self tan says something doesnt it?</li>
            <li>fair, freckled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either use a good sugar scrub or get an exfoliating mitt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give you a great nice even tan.</li>
            <li>It got good reviews, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>I am so incredibly fair that when I roll up my pants in the sunlight, I pull a &#x27;Twilight&#x27;.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a good thing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>

            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I am about as fair as they come.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it once, and I had fairly good results.</li>
            <li>Every one on youtube was raving about this product saying how good it was</li>
            <li>but I could tell there was a good amount of color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl who can tan; but chooses not to.</li>
            <li>but this product seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Gives me a good fan.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair skinned</li>
            <li>if you put it on at night before bed, it&#x27;s a good idea to have dark-colored bedsheets, or else you&#x27;re going to have some staining on your sheets by morning.</li>
            <li>I started using the St. Tropez mousse and loved it, but decided to give this stuff a try after my bottle ran out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m good with the shade it gives me.</li>
            <li>it looks great on my skin-tone and the smell is nice too.</li>

            <li>Guess I should just stick with a good thing when I have it! :)</li>

            <li>I use a loofah to exfoliate, put some lotion on my elbows and knees, and use the handy mitten to apply.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it smells nice</li>
            <li>It really truly smells the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used (my boyfriend approves).</li>
            <li>and I just smiled and said, \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>I reapplied this for three nights in a row and now I&#x27;m a nice tan shade.</li>
            <li>This product really can be applied flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a great transaction and great quality product.</li>
            <li>The result is a nice even bronze color.</li>
            <li>It gives a great looking tan in no time and the low price is excellent.</li>
            <li>But, there is still a nice tan on your skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and I highly recommend it as a must try!</li>
            <li>the color is awesome and the idea of using a mitt and protective rubber gloves really makes self tanning</li>
            <li>liked that unlike the lotions or mousse</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to try this product from all the rave reviews and the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>I also really liked that it didn&#x27;t stain my clothing.</li>
            <li>flawless dries really fast</li>
            <li>application; it&#x27;s spreads nicely, gives an immediate color that continues to develop through the day/night without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING AND WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Loving this product, can&#x27;t wait to show my mother.</li>
            <li>The built in bronzer leaves a really nice color while the tanner is developing.</li>
            <li>and it even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Even after I showered I had a nice tan through the week.</li>
            <li>I recommend showering before you wear something nice.</li>
            <li>I washed it after every tan application with warm water and</li>
            <li>I fear lots of compliments on &amp;#34; my nice tan&amp;#34; , &amp;#34; where have you been&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Gives a nice brown color not orange</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply in good lighting</li>
            <li>a nice brown</li>
            <li>The mitt is nice, and I recommend shaving and exfoliating before doing this and leavin it on for 12 hours + then rinse off your body, and you will have a nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>so i make sure to wash it really good after i use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone that wants a nice, even looking tan without using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a good moisturizer before tanning those areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really what gives you the flawless result.</li>
            <li>it really does make you look flawless.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s probably the darkest tan I have ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li>and I always get a nice, even color.</li>
            <li>(Which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I kind of like it...</li>
            <li>It was sketchy getting it off Amazon, but it really is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the perfect golden tan that I have always wanted and never been able to achieve with a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I liked the St. Tropez lotion but found after one application I would take a shower and</li>
            <li>product does have a nice smell in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes with a handy applicator pad.  </li>

            <li>Absolute best self tanner out there.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this self tanner</li>
            <li>: I wanted to try self tanners so I could have a nice tan for a wedding I am in, instead of using tanning beds.</li>
            <li>I have my own tanning bed at home</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best tan in a bottle on the market ...</li>
            <li>I will use up the product, because it does give a nice color</li>
            <li>Gives a nice brown tan.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not expect to like this product.</li>

            <li>I liked the color</li>
            <li>I have tried some of the popular:</li>
            <li>or so you will get a nice bronze look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This goes on really nicely, and you can see where you are applying the color.</li>
            <li>but this one looked like a nice option because of the price, 2k glowing reviews, and the fact that it came with a mit.</li>
            <li>that awesome bronze goddess glow that every woman wants but to no avail.</li>
            <li>it kind of smells like chocolate) and</li>
            <li>Nice</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m olive complexion and this gives me a nice glow on legs.</li>
            <li>and the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li>After that I wake up NON SMELLY with a nice tan</li>
            <li>and honestly I don&#x27;t want to do that once a week.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice color though.</li>
            <li>Loving this product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it is buildable: want a glow?</li>
            <li>Tan is a nice brown and not orangy.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon, read the reviews, and with 95% or more being good reviews I decided to order.</li>

            <li>Thanks arrived before the time awesome.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice but the color did come off as a bit orange.</li>
            <li>tan appearance is a nice color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t noticeable, it is nice.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the product is also quite nice, it&#x27;s kind of tropical.</li>
            <li>Nice tan not orange color.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, not orange, no streaking and smells great!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend using a warm perfume like coconut, magnolia, or vanilla to help cover it.  </li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>I have found products just as good or better though, for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>The mitt worked well for me and was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It smells nice in the bottle.</li>
            <li>My tan looks nice.</li>
            <li>I wanted believable color but not to go from fair to Snooki in one day.</li>
            <li>I liked about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and most self tanners make me orange</li>
            <li>Whenever I am complimented on my tan I always recommend this product and they end up loving it too.</li>
            <li>I liked this stuff so much I went and bought the flawless darker.</li>
            <li>it turned out really nice.</li>
            <li>The box has everything you will need for application, so thats nice that you wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase a mitt or gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this na dthen let me try her once before i ordered my own.  </li>
            <li>Liked the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice golden/brown tan.</li>
            <li>I used this 4 days in a row, and still hadn&#x27;t achieved a nice tan.</li>
            <li>i dont agree with the nice smell.</li>
            <li>think this product fades nicely and doesn&#x27;t get blotchy when it&#x27;s fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly the ritual for putting this stuff on is a pain I find.</li>
            <li>: If you are allergic to latex gloves, buy the senstive kind.</li>
            <li>This fake-bake creates a nice light-med brown color with no orange undertones.  </li>
            <li>i tried everything else and found some lotions that i liked for the color however when it would fade</li>
            <li>Honestly I would save your money.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be really popular</li>
            <li>Will be a nice collection to have when I start accutane and can&#x27;t use tanning beds.</li>
            <li>But its really nice to use when I need it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t probably do this for my own wedding, but just to go out...</li>

            <li>/&gt;I was already fairly tan, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was going to show up on me.</li>
            <li>The mitt it comes with to apply the product really helps to make your tan flawless and not streaky.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but I&#x27;m surprised at all the wonderful reviews given by fair-skinned people saying it&#x27;s bronze and not orange-y.</li>
            <li>It is so nice not walking around looking orangey,</li>
            <li>Just a nice glowy look.</li>

            <li>and it was a nice looking tan</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that they include latex gloves.</li>
            <li>But i just can&#x27;t seem to get it to go on my legs or belly as nice.</li>
            <li>and I can apply it anytime in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping at a great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still kind of getting used to it.</li>

            <li>BUT, it is very easy to buy a tanning mitt elsewhere with these qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy</li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>Mitt and &amp;#34;guide color&amp;#34; make it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply, the coat was even, just follow the instruction, shave, scrub and apply some cream or body butter on ankles, knees, elbows...</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on very easily, and does NOT streak.  </li>
            <li>Wish it did&#x27;t fade, but very easy to re-apply.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li>and I burn very easily in the sun</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and had tropical scent to it.</li>
            <li>Almost all have a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>Also very easy to apply since the bronze color prevents streaks.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, never had an issue with streaking.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to appy.</li>
            <li>The application is very easy.</li>
            <li>The application process was very easy as the tanner comes with a mitt and is tinted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY easy to apply and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily with the included hand glove.</li>

            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t very strong (which is what i was going for).</li>
            <li>It has a very strong tropical odor but an underlying chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However on the skin the smell isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>And very very easy to put on..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Application was very easy, but I felt like I might have been over stressing about applying it evenly on my body.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS!</li>

            <li>This self tanner is almost one of the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>I find it best to spray it directly on my skin however, a couple sprays at a time, then rub it in with the mitt.  </li>

            <li>I also read a lot of reviews saying to spray the product on your skin then rub it in because it&#x27;s definitely more effective</li>
            <li>but then a nice tan for the rest of the week :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this product works great for me - plus it actually smells good which is a first for a tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Smooth application and build able - scent is pleasant-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like it as much b/c its a liquid spray, not foam, like the St. Tropez, but it works perfectly well and blends easily.</li>
            <li>It does a good job if you are wanting a quick nice tan</li>
            <li>Love it, easy to apply, smells good and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; at all.</li>

            <li>This is by the far the best and most natural-looking tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I had no orange streaks, only a nice even tan--it even worked great on my face!</li>
            <li>(so you eon&#x27;t miss a spot) is a great color on its own and is wearable throughout the day itself without being sticky or transferring (if you really want to be bronzed).</li>
            <li>Great price, great product, will definitely purchase again, when needed.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great price, maybe get a different mitt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Looked really good and the tone was a nice golden bronzey tan not orange.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products on the market and this one was by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is THE BEST , most natural, tanned look, I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best self-tanner i have used so far, i prefer it over st-tropez and many others...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanning products over the years &amp; this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, creates a super natural looking tan that lasts days, smells great, not sticky or tacky, awesome price.</li>
            <li>excellent product for a quick flawless tan especially for your legs that don&#x27;t get color as quick when</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and dont have much luck with self tanners but this one has a really great color and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best self tanner I have used, and I have used many.</li>
            <li>Great product, good natural color.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I have tried many spay self tanners and this is by far the best i have ever tried!</li>
            <li>The tan is no too brown, and not too golden; it is a perfect golden color.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it doesn&#x27;t really streak and gives a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to add that the color isn&#x27;t orange like most products, it gives you a perfectly brown, natural look.</li>
            <li>The mitt makes it very easy to apply all over your body more evenly than hands alone.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and I love the fact that I can see where it is going while putting it on.</li>
            <li>I love how it comes with gloves and a mitt - makes it very easy to apply evenly and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hands being stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both give a beautiful tan, but on my light skin, I found that the original works better.</li>
            <li>I would suggest exfoliating really well and using a light application working up to the amount of tan desired (using very light around fingers, arm creases, etc), I also used it before going in the sun which gave best results.</li>
            <li>Great color and very real looking.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and love the mit that comes with it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, make sure you use the gloves!</li>
            <li>Not 5 stars because it faded pretty quickly, but if you want to look tan for a party or event, this stuff is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and this gave me a nice all over warmth that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li>I love it very good no mess!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, it went on great, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;, waited about 5 to 6 days</li>
            <li>I gave myself a five o&#x27; clock shadow the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li>in fact, my husband even complemented me on how great I looked &amp; that doesn&#x27;t happen often ;)</li>
            <li>Works just as great as my first bottle.</li>
            <li>My first try at self tanning and this stuff is great</li>
            <li>This product looks great when first applying, but after a day or two begins to spot.</li>
            <li>After that I can barely notice any sent at all, which is perfect!</li>
            <li>This works very well and blends beautifully on my skin.</li>
            <li>I might try the darker one soon, but this is pretty great.</li>
            <li>This is by-far the best tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used, even my boyfriend approves, and he HATES self tanners because im generally smelly and orange.</li>
            <li>GreAt product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty great for a home self tanner.</li>
            <li>woke up to a beautiful tan that looks real .</li>
            <li>happy I&#x27;m glowing ;)</li>
            <li>The color is great at first.....</li>

            <li>Great product, lasts a whole season!</li>
            <li>I tried it out yesterday for the first time, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as potent as the Flawless, and the Fair is harder to have saturate the skin.</li>

            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin, so I have difficulty finding a tanning product that works well for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and it&#x27;s a beautiful and natural tanning color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy with this stuff - I will be buying this as my main tanner from now on!</li>
            <li>I have very fair, Irish skin, the kind that burns and never, never gets tan.</li>
            <li>Just the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning cream is huge!</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product....</li>
            <li>and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I get a lovely bronze color.</li>
            <li>I would love it if it came with a nozzle like the misleading picture</li>
            <li>The company needs to take care of this issue as I would have givin this product more stars.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT and will NOT go without it from here on out.</li>
            <li>We are getting better and faster with the application process.  </li>
            <li>Make sure not to have any lotions/moisturizers on the skin before applying.</li>
            <li>you get your skin the better.</li>
            <li>So this is a safe way to have that California Kissed Skin look.</li>
            <li>so i dont need to apply more then twice a week.</li>
            <li>LOVE the mit.  </li>
            <li>It smells and applies great, but if your looking for a very brown tan I would go with the million dollar tan products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this gets better with more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>, make sure you stay out of the rain and puddles...</li>
            <li>I love this spray tan.</li>
            <li>Love the mitt - I wash it after each use</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than Mystic tan or any spray tans I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff... try it.</li>
            <li>smell is okay</li>
            <li>I think this tanner mostly \\&quot;stains\\</li>
            <li>absolutely love the color.  </li>
            <li>But love this too now.  </li>
            <li>did use this on my face, but I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 6-7 hours more like 1-2.</li>
            <li>But the actual product is brilliant!</li>
            <li>It goes on more like a stain than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I like the stain better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on even, nice light scent and lasts longer than others.</li>
            <li>I would also make for sure to use the glove that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this one came with the mitt and gloves.</li>
            <li>Love using the mitt.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my fiance&#x27;</li>
            <li>I apply a second coat after my shower and just get wonderful results :)</li>
            <li>it leaks though if the bottle turns over and mine got knocked over and most of it spilled out.</li>
            <li>if you purchase make sure to set the bottle someplace it wont get knocked over.</li>
            <li>it goes on better if you do.</li>
            <li>decided to give it one more shot.</li>
            <li>Also, this product smells much better than all others and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have never found any self tanner that has worked better than this.</li>
            <li>My arms where already darker and did get the most color.</li>
            <li>im in love with this stuff</li>
            <li>but over all ok</li>
            <li>but I must say I absolutely love this Tanner</li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion, so most self-tanners turn me freakishly orange.</li>
            <li>The box says that it is safe to use on your face, however it broke me out...</li>
            <li>but when I washed it off there was a lot more brown in the water.</li>
            <li>I felt I saved more product that way because the mitt soakes up a lot.of product,  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt it comes with.</li>
            <li>Ordered more</li>
            <li>I love the mitt and the ease of application.</li>
            <li>Maybe its more of a gradual tan?</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>found it looks 10 times better than a salon tan.</li>
            <li>So, I have tried many self tanners over the years.</li>
            <li>I now have a gorgeous golden tan, too.</li>
            <li>I love the way I look when I&#x27;m tan</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>There are not enough good things I could say about this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of products (I still LOVE million dollar tan)</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>The best time to use this self tanner is after exfoliating your skin when the pores are open.</li>
            <li>I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>This is much more convenient and safer than laying in the sun or a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I found this sooner.</li>
            <li>and I am sure no one is staring at my legs anyhow.</li>
            <li>However after using this stuff, I have to say that I think it works better than the spray, and much better than anything I had used before as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the color and ease that it goes on.</li>
            <li>A piece of advice though, make sure you use the mitt that they provide.</li>
            <li>It is easier to use with the pad and covers more area with the use of the pad.  </li>
            <li>It works okay...</li>
            <li>although it did start to look better after a couple of showers.</li>
            <li>Talk about an instant flawless tan in seconds.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have NO complaints whatsoever. :)</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 25% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid]]and</li>
            <li>Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground.</li>
            <li>wish I would have gone through more than one application before writing my review.</li>
            <li>This product is better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever have had.</li>
            <li>It applies better, smells better, drys better and lasts longer at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>She is stunning.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a pump spray.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this stuff</li>
            <li>Applied more than once also just to be sure I was applying correctly and it wasn&#x27;t a gradual process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure more to come.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>:) I will defiently be getting more</li>
            <li>/&gt;the color is believable</li>
            <li>BUT there might be better mitts out there</li>
            <li>ok, a lot.</li>
            <li>I have also found that most self tanners cause me to break out if used on my face.  </li>
            <li>Although, I am sure I am losing some of the product to absorbtion into the mitt.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Which by the way I love that it has a color guide so you can tell were you have already applied it.</li>
            <li>SO SO many sunless tanners and they have always had their cons,</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased and will keep using this product.</li>
            <li>Best instant tanning spray ever.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Word of caution, make sure you use a scrub.</li>
            <li>My favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Better then the risk of tanning beds or even the sun.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>If you use astringent with cotton ball, most of what is on your face comes off on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
            <li>Upon using it the 1st time, spilled some on my house dress &amp; bed sheets, didn&#x27;t wash them for over 24 hours &amp; was sure it would stain, it did not stain either item at all.  </li>
            <li>but I have better ones that wear more evenly).</li>
            <li>I have tried many options over the years</li>
            <li>Even my most hard-core tanning friends don&#x27;t like tanning every day because their products are a hassle</li>
            <li>Make sure you specifically do circular motions or it&#x27;ll make you blotchy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a product better that absorbs into your skin and</li>
            <li>It went on ok</li>
            <li>After reading countless excellent reviews for this product, I purchased one box.  </li>
            <li>Arms look ok.  </li>
            <li>Will try the lotion &amp; see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews about this product</li>
            <li>If your thinking about buying, try it--You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It really makes like you have a great tan with out the sun.</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and I will be placing an order soon for another bottle just to be sure not to run out.</li>
            <li>for the price you&#x27;d think they have better spray pump on this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking sexy.</li>
            <li>I am just glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>And you do have to make sure to stay away from water until your tan has set for about 15 minutes to be safe.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate before hand and</li>
            <li>the night before you apply the tanner make sure you put body butter or hydrating lotion to your knees, elbows, and decolletage</li>
            <li>(make sure you close your eyes) and one mist on neck.  </li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners and never been satisfied with the results like I am with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>, I love that it doesn&#x27;t stink like a lot of the tanners do.</li>
            <li>The biggest thing I&#x27;ve found is that you need to order more applying mitts.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate before using this product, because your tan will be a lot more even and look nicer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, most of it will come off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I get when I use this tanner I get compliments on how healthy and glowy I look.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>I am about to order more</li>
            <li>NO ORANGE! :)</li>
            <li>Not an orangish hue like most.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure you wear the latex gloves under the mit.  </li>
            <li>I plan to order more.</li>
            <li>My legs look slimmer and more defined.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve been laying in the sun :)</li>
            <li>Really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Omg I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love everything from the ease of application to the smell and the color it gives.</li>
            <li>sure you do not use this when you have any lotion, creams or oils on, it will not work on those areas.</li>
            <li>It works best if you exfoliate in the shower and use lotion when you get out- especially on areas like knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li>Mostly all self-tanners leave either a smelly, streaky &amp; orange tint on your skin, but this didn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>Also be sure to bend your elbows and knees when you apply it there.  </li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I have used many different products throughout the years, and this is the best!</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better.</li>
            <li>This is great if you want fast results and arent planning on being splashed or swimming.</li>
            <li>so make sure you moisturize, it seems to work even better.</li>
            <li>I made sure to exfoliate the day before</li>
            <li>:) I will deffintly buy this again.</li>
            <li>After reading some more reviews I find out</li>
            <li>I can even make it better with blending balm</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to wash it off in time.</li>
            <li>Everything else looks 100 times better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different tanning products and the Fakebake is the best.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked better if I exfoliated with the Baiden mitt.  </li>
            <li>Its just okay would not buy again</li>
            <li>tan (because of the color guide) and could tell everywhere that I applied the product to make sure I applied it evenly.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Coppertone Sunless Tanning Lotion which leaves a much more noticeable tan.  </li>
            <li>i love that its a liquid and comes with a applicator mitt.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much i love this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li>Looks better on my arms than on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners before--creams, towels, sprays--and this blew my mind.  </li>
            <li>No streaks, great color, dries really fast.</li>
            <li>..my husband said it made my skin look even and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The more you put on the darker it will be.  </li>
            <li>Not being able to go in the sun, I consider my self a connoisseur of self tanners.</li>
            <li>Posting some photos so you can read and see more about this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This one worked well although it didn&#x27;t come with an applicator and was a bit more orange/ yellowy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>(Maybe more than needed.)</li>
            <li>It should absorb better on the face.</li>
            <li>(Maybe more than needed.)</li>
            <li>It should absorb better on the face.</li>
            <li>Best results are achieved by following the directions and applying before bed and letting it work overnight--personally, I apply it 1 to 1.5 hours before bed to give it time to &amp;</li>
            <li>In a pinch, I have also been able to apply this in the morning before heading out and while I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that, I didn&#x27;t look orange.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You do need to apply more than once for desired shade.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this stuff is wonderful for a light natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>AND they forgot to add the spray bottle top.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the gloves and the mitt concept because I never have to wash my hands and worry about my hands being orange afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since the feet have too many curves it won&#x27;t apply evenly and will turn out blotchy.  </li>
            <li>and you get many uses out of one bottle</li>
            <li>It provids a color that many people compliment.</li>
            <li>so many self tanning products just make me look orange.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with how many times a week to use this.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would be better since it has a mitt included in the box.  </li>
            <li>I may need to figure out a better way to apply it though.  </li>
            <li>but I decided a while back that it wasn&#x27;t the best thing for me</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I love the spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>#34;fake bake airbrush.&amp;#34; I love this product.</li>
            <li>I sprayed the mitt and just kept going from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink and it is just fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners and this is my fav</li>
            <li>I would also recommend Body Drench, but I think I like this even better.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t it will not go on smoothly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many tanning products.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than a spray tan...</li>
            <li>I almost canceled my order but now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have been using self-tanners since I was in the 6th grade, which is um 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;ve noticed the more you put on</li>
            <li>so I had my lovely husband help me apply this on</li>
            <li>WILL ORDER SOME MORE AS SOON AS NEEDED.</li>
            <li>This spring, I thought to myself, instead of looking so pasty for the all of spring and most of summer, maybe I should give this a go.</li>
            <li>I could not tell you if this product is better</li>
            <li>I look better with this tan than i ever looked.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that isn&#x27;t streaky or orange.</li>
            <li>The solution, no mater how many times I sprayed onto the mitt for each limb, never soaked through the mitt onto my hands.</li>
            <li>I love the results I got from this.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do the commonsense prep work before applying it</li>
            <li>Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, make sure to wash the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li>but it works better if you just spray it on your skin :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that season...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But overall its great for the price!</li>
            <li>Love this tanner.</li>
            <li>Would love to use this again</li>
            <li>As others I have tried many a self tanning product.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>a better bottle will arrive)&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li>However, this tanner smells like the Hawaiian tropic tanning oil we all know and love,</li>
            <li>I really was hopeful about this product after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews that said IT HAS NO SMELL....</li>
            <li>They more you apply, the darker you go.</li>
            <li>provides the rubber gloves, but you do have to watch to make sure you don&#x27;t leave any streaks.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to get</li>
            <li>favorite tanner  love it</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>This product comes with pump spray top and the application mit (with st tropez the mit is an additional $10).</li>
            <li>Even better, when it fades it doesn&#x27;t leave me splotchy.  </li>
            <li>guess that&#x27;s what husbands are for :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you rinse the mitt in the sink between uses.</li>

            <li>Fake Bake Flawless has been the perfect answer to my tanning woes.</li>
            <li>I had used about 1/2 the product or more</li>
            <li>but this was over the top.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d give it one more try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li>It is my favorite of all the tanning prouducts I have ever used!And</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash the glove.</li>
            <li>It also smells like coconut, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I like that you can make it lighter or darker by how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li>This product works like it&#x27;s supposed to. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have used so many brands of self-tanner since I stopped using tanning beds 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li>it is just absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>apply more.</li>
            <li>The glove gave me no problem with shedding and I washed it every so many uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one if the better self tanners out there in terms of ease and color.</li>
            <li>For the price, I feel it should be more low-maintenance.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too, kind-of beachy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanner and it works great,easy application</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought this</li>

            <li>all my friends asked me where I been tanning the results show up immediately I love this stuff I will buy this again</li>
            <li>i love the mitt and gloves.</li>
            <li>So, I will try a couple more brands for that area specifically.</li>
            <li>I love this this stuff.</li>
            <li>otherwise the mitt tends to absorb it and you have to use more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak and I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Much more involved than the lore</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate as directed.</li>
            <li>Make sure to put on at night and wash off in morning.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that you can see it going on and</li>
            <li>It also gets into pores on my chest and stains them making them more visible as well as getting into my hair follicles on my legs.  </li>
            <li>will buy again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better and I like the tan but don&#x27;t want to be out in the sun because cancer runs in my family.  </li>
            <li>then when you shower after 6-9 hours most of it does come off.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>But if you are, your results should be fantastic!</li>
            <li>It dries so fast, smells great and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to exercise this year</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I turned my Sister and niece on to this product and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I still have yet to find anything I really love.  </li>
            <li>It gives even, healthy tan without orange.  </li>
            <li>Will order again before ever tryin another orange sunless tanner!!! :)</li>
            <li>but I love ware skirts</li>
            <li>- will use it forever - love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It really works well and the color is great.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, after reading one review I did cut the tube to the spray top shorter.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, although, if it went on as a color you could see better where you missed or need to reapply.</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch Youtube videos about application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I love the mitt that comes with this.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many products I have raved about to friends and family, but this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>No nasty smell.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt to put it on with to keep my hands from staining.  </li>
            <li>Works flawlessly for me personally.</li>
            <li>I loved having that golden glow</li>
            <li>If you use it at night like they suggest it does provide better coverage.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice, even, light color on the skin though.  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>the more you use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better to apply it with latex gloves</li>
            <li>For me, I am very happy that I am a &#x27;darker shade of white&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I use Tinted Love moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I love this product, but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li>This has more of a brown color that compliments my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the tan.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend doing this as mine works perfectly now!  </li>
            <li>Be sure and wear the included gloves along with the mit.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments after using this,</li>
            <li>I have tried so many self tanners.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is probably one of the best self tanners I have used.  </li>
            <li>(I love to go bed</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many self tanners...</li>
            <li>are the reasons I love this self-tanner:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>mostly gradual tanning lotions like Jergens.</li>
            <li>My father passed away from melanoma and I&#x27;m terrified of being in the sun, but I love having a tan.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate throughly before you use this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and it practically dries instantly!</li>
            <li>(anyone have a better recommendation?)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hands, a washcloth, and a sponge as backups, and they were all hilarious jokes.</li>
            <li>I wish the mitt lasted as longas the bottle did, because I do not wish to spend even more money on a backup applicator method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>Dries quicker than most.</li>
            <li>you might look more faked than baked.</li>
            <li>It has the most undetectable scent it&#x27;s like a mix of coconut and vanilla</li>
            <li>Im not too sure what the gloves are for</li>
            <li>but my shower I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to write this review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this self tanner one, but I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had luck with sunless tanning before but this product actually works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was probably user error, so</li>
            <li>I will say I got better color pay off with the gloves than the mitt, so I would recommend using the gloves all over and maybe the mitt for your hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Even wore it for engagement pictures. :)</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless goes on, well flawless, with no streaks!</li>
            <li>My favorite fake-bake self tanner.</li>
            <li>I prefer this spray formula over the foam and lotion, and I love that it comes with an application mitt.</li>
            <li>but instead it made the scaly spots even darker and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to have a tan without the problems a real suntan create.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect tanning product!  </li>
            <li>but it only takes 30 seconds to put on and the application glove is one of the best I&#x27;ve used for spray on tan.</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I love about amazon..  </li>
            <li>the spray top no longer worked</li>
            <li>and I was hoping the spray would stay on better.</li>
            <li>Favorite self-tanner, been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Also, exfoliate before use AND MAKE SURE YOU SHAVE BEFORE YOU APPLY THIS.</li>
            <li>This more seemed to just paint over my body.</li>
            <li>and that was a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t turn orange like most others.</li>
            <li>I love the glove.</li>
            <li>many sites pointed to Fake Bake Flawless as one of the best at home NON ORANGE tan you could do at home.</li>
            <li>but, heck what was one more orange glow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love the mitt and the way it applies.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a better color on me.</li>
            <li>Love it...does not streak.</li>
            <li>just make sure to get even coverage</li>
            <li>Love the tropical smell.</li>
            <li>Love this tanner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great brown color with no orangey color at all!</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>The color pay-off of this product is not the best, though it says you can reapply multiple times to deepen the color.</li>
            <li>I cannot take any more sun, and I don&#x27;t need to with this product</li>
            <li>My favorite things about this product: 1)</li>
            <li>It smells more like a coconut/tropical scented lotion, and I don&#x27;t find it to be overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>and I have more complaints than praises when it comes to this</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this product would be better?</li>
            <li>Believable color.</li>
            <li>Be sure to scrub it all off before applying another go around.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have to tell you...</li>
            <li>buy it, I promise you will love it</li>
            <li>The brown mist seems to get everywhere when spraying so be sure to use this in the shower (not while showering)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>Love this tanner.</li>
            <li>, I love it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>And the part I love most is it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes.</li>
            <li>I reapply every so many days, or nightly for a darker tan.</li>
            <li>and I get a day of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Gives you a beautiful tan.&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy but the color on your skin after application is beautiful</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best self-tanner I have ever purchased, definitely my HG self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I love the price of this product and i will defintely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Not orange like many self-tanners.</li>
            <li>Turns skin a more brown tinged tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t smell like so many self tanners do.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better to apply it two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>I have had so many complements.</li>
            <li>fabulous tan!</li>
            <li>Love the color and ease of application.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>but it is more work than spray on.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased</li>
            <li>The more you put on, the darker you get</li>
            <li>Only wash with soap with your hand or you will wash off your beautiful tan!!  </li>
            <li>The more you keep your skin hydrated the longer</li>
            <li>but that time on that fabric it was okay.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak even on the top of my feet.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>I use the product, I love the product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something more long-term, I would look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>It literally DOES NOT get any better than this product.</li>
            <li>I applied on day 1 and then day 3 to try to get a more baked look but the additional application didn&#x27;t produce more color.</li>
            <li>it always made you look spotty and orange, this Fake Bake Flawless is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use an exfoliating sugar or salt scrub before use.</li>
            <li>After buying countless others, I will not use anything else but this.&lt;br /&gt;The mit and gloves it comes with is perfect.</li>
            <li>Mitt is interesting and can be helpful to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pinker toned, I think this will look even more orange.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to apply to lips and eyelids</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I get so many complements on my tan.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the better tanners I&#x27;ve ran into.  </li>
            <li>I was hopping for something slightly more drastic.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it still has an odor, but it is more tropical than the tell tale sunless tanner smell most give off.</li>
            <li>Love this tanner.</li>
            <li>was OK</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s building color gradually &amp; totally believably.  </li>
            <li>I love the buffing mitt idea</li>
            <li>I am a pasty white redhead, and this gives me wonderfully even, brown color.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with the mitt</li>
            <li>so you are able to apply the product evenly.</li>
            <li>more of a brownish shade, the scent is a bit offensive, and the cost is so much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d argue that, when used properly, this is the best sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>This will keep it in MUCH better</li>
            <li>2: Take some scissors and snip off a bit more than an inch of the spray bottle attachment that came with the product, and put the modified attachment onto the bottle.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it and was ok with it if I tanned well, but I am both tan and NOT  SMELLY!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It blends wonderfully, it wears well, and the color builds with daily applications.</li>
            <li>Love that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Would not wash out like most.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanning products over the years, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Ok lets just start off..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 15 self tanners in the last 2 years or so and have not been impressed by any.</li>
            <li>I believe I do better with a creamier consistency, as it is easier to handle.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, guess it&#x27;s ok if you spray a lot on.</li>
            <li>this product is okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt because it makes everything go on even.</li>
            <li>Just put on the cute, purple, rubber gloves, 2.)</li>
            <li>Smells more like a lotion used for getting in the tanner bed, rather then those smelly gradual tanners like Jergens e</li>
            <li>DEFINATELY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always washed out except for one workout top that I had to throw away.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>sure and use the mitt and gloves included.  </li>
            <li>I put mine on the top of a lotion bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product works just like it says.</li>
            <li>Will not turn you &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and the applicator mitt helps with making sure that I won&#x27;t be streaky.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something authentic looking and without a smell.  </li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I tan in a bed, in my opinion this stuff saves you money and is better for your skin.  :)</li>
            <li>I love this product and I can avoid going to tanning beds year-round.</li>
            <li>so tanning beds and laying out like most girls aren&#x27;t an option</li>
            <li>get it ppeople :)</li>
            <li>This product gives me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Awesome especially in winter.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I wait hours after my shower just to be sure.</li>
            <li>If you leave it on for 48 hours you can scrub and your tan will not be affected which is why I love this product.</li>
            <li>sure you apply it more generously to paler areas</li>
            <li>This is better</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better luck and nicer results with ULTA sunless tanning spray and Neutrogena Micro Mist.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply at night.</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>You can even use this in the morning, before work or school, although most would recommend applying at night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use it on your face, just make sure you use one spray on the mitt and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget your ears and hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can fix it by just applying more, but just makes the process longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love how brown the color is, versus the &#x27;orange&#x27; effect that DHA (sunless tanner) can sometimes give.</li>
            <li>You will probably LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and i should blend it in more with the mitt</li>
            <li>I get to know it, I&#x27;ll give more information on this item experiencing</li>
            <li>Most importantly, THERE ISN&#x27;T AN ORANGE STREAK IN SIGHT!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, like most self tanners do.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate before you use this, &amp; keep your skin MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, and works better than any tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I love that it colors you immediately.</li>
            <li>Nothing get my tanner, and in the most even way.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear the latex gloves with the mit you get with the bottle</li>
            <li>Do not be dettered, its like most things...</li>
            <li>That is better then</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Ive tried many many many sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>product I give 5 stars and the shipper I give 4.5 stars :)</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t irritated, I look healthy and tanned and feel amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>night I immediately bought 2 more bottles, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to look like a lovely shade of oompa loompa before an event I was looking forward to.</li>
            <li>Just a tip- make sure to wash the mitt after every application or you will ruin it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure beforehand to cover elbows, knees, hands with some sort of lotion, i prefer hemp lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most self tanners)</li>
            <li>This the product left best color i have ever had from self tanner!</li>
            <li>I love the spray in the tan can that this brand has.</li>
            <li>its one was ok for my legs</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>it is my favorite self-tanner</li>
            <li>Love the mint and color.</li>
            <li>I think it does give you more of a brown color than this does.</li>
            <li>This for me is more brown/bronze color.</li>
            <li>, I think I like the lotions better.</li>
            <li>And, I have used many, many.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the price and the look the product gives.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And love that it is tinted so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a safe alternative to tanning in beds during the off-season</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying more than one time every week or so.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite self tanners.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can express how much I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better than my tanning bed tan.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most of the color washed away with one shower.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to shave and exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic self-tanner!</li>
            <li>But this company is definitely the best I&#x27;ve found out of many, many, many self-tanning products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the color it gives me.</li>
            <li>Will buy more and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li>to apply - love the mitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Big money saver and great results!</li>
            <li>I like the product &amp; the color, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>The diluted lotion goes on even, you just have to use it more often.</li>
            <li>I watched youtube videos and read a lot of the reviews just to make sure it was going to be a good self tanner and worth my money.</li>
            <li>My legs looked okay</li>
            <li>.. there weren&#x27;t as many streaks on them as there was my arms.</li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this bc all the reviews and youtube videos</li>
            <li>I considered hitting a tanning bed but that would conflict with my healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground.</li>
            <li>also smells like Malibu rum &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many tanning products, believe me.</li>
            <li>so I could confidently wear shorts</li>
            <li>but i love it will order more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s semi-fixable if you apply more so for that I take off one star.</li>
            <li>and it was BETTER</li>
            <li>Going to put it on one more night</li>
            <li>the summer- used in spring and was satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I love not getting it on my hands, and I&#x27;ve been rinsing it out per another review.</li>
            <li>I thought surely this is the product for me.</li>
            <li>With no time to actually go get spray tanned and wanting to get the best value for my dollar, I thought this product was for sure the way to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I literally got it about 40 minutes ago.</li>
            <li>maybe i need to work on it more?</li>
            <li>I have not found a better self tanner out there and have been using it intermittently since 2013.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your mitt in the washer every once in a while, and I try to rinse my mitt after every application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reccomended this product to many of my friends and clients.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better than this.</li>
            <li>Love the mitten.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of this stuff &amp; so does my husband.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product I use it every two days, the color is a bronze color.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>No streaks no horrible odor!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t sweat AT ALL while putting this on, it&#x27;ll run and get on everything.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a great glow i havent put so much on</li>
            <li>love the fact you can build the color up to how you want it.</li>
            <li>but I found spraying it directing onto my body and then rubbing it in works much better,</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear gloves under the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that it has the color guide in it</li>
            <li>love love love this product.</li>
            <li>My arms and chest have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling slimy.</li>
            <li>I gave this product four stars, because it is better than most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted more on the bronze/brown side.</li>
            <li>Now, it took two applications to get a nice light tan that I wanted.</li>
            <li>the body exfoliation, I just used my exfoliating mitts, You can find them on Amazon or at the drugstore and should not cost more than $3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaints here just that i will be purchasing more as soon as i run out :-)</li>
            <li>Love the glove that come with it so that it keep the product off your hands.</li>
            <li>This is much better than Jergens.</li>
            <li>and I seriously LOVE this self tanner.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer part will wash off, but you will still have a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh was a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on the tan, for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought 2 bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>The color indicator (and most of the smell) will shower off in the morning.</li>
            <li>and make sure you don&#x27;t miss spots.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product and the applicator glove that goes with it.</li>
            <li>3 stars mostly for the mitt.</li>
            <li>The tanner itself is ok</li>
            <li>I like this product, but am not in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love that a mitt is included.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really was happy with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>They must need to improve the top, perhaps some form of gasket to seal it better.</li>
            <li>I simply love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasons I love it</li>
            <li>I would spray more (for example for a sunkissed look I would do maybe about 4 sprays on each arm, if I want a more bronzed look I would do 6 sprays)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use lotions or oils before applying.</li>
            <li>Hint; cut off about 3/4 inch of spray tube so that it fits better in the bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did this on a day</li>
            <li>guide color looks better than the tan.</li>
            <li>will buy more.</li>
            <li>Meaning that the cost for this product is better than most.  </li>
            <li>i think the color left is beautiful and it does not streak!</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this purchase and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I was able to darken 4 shades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure people think I&#x27;m in the tanning beds a lot to maintain bronze skin but</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely more has leaked out than I have been able to use</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>The product did what it was supposed to...make me look tan, but it accentuated my flaws more than make me look better.</li>
            <li>; smell after a couple of hours, contrary to what most of the reviews said.</li>
            <li>Love the product , but will never buy it online again.  </li>
            <li>Best to use at night then wash off the coloring that is used to guide during application the following morning.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do better that way.  </li>
            <li>(so glad I did)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a deep sun kissed tan an looks great!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with fakebake that I knew I had to write a review.</li>
            <li>I spend a fair amount of time outside, in Florida, and have never been able to get a great tan.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Most people can&#x27;t tell that i just have sunless tanner on.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this color, it&#x27;s not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt AND the rubber gloves</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>, i added some more today</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>The kits comes with everything you need to get a believable tan, with my threat of being orange.</li>
            <li>The instructions say not to put on any kind of lotion before applying, so I just got the mitt the littlest bit wet under the sink &amp; re-rubbed in the areas that were getting streaky &amp; it worked awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I get so many complements on how tan I look.  </li>
            <li>Adding 2 at once(waiting until one dries and apply again) looks much better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still able to wash off any residue so none of the coloring gets on my clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You Can See , The Product Has More Pros Than Cons ,</li>
            <li>Because I Probably Applied Too Many Layers .</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner, doesn&#x27;t steak, splotch, turn orange.</li>
            <li>I love the price and it includes a mitt and rubber gloves.</li>
            <li>w/elbows &amp; knuckles, be sure to bend so that you get the product in the creases.</li>
            <li>So many people complimented my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; and when I told them it was a self tanner</li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used self tanner in about 15 years or more....</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions mostly.</li>
            <li>I put on the cute purple gloves sprayed the product onto the glove and started buffing the product on.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would def recommend it:)</li>
            <li>the more orange/streaky</li>
            <li>it might work better.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it smells like pina colada during application, then once it dries it has almost no smell at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak and I love that it has the applicator mit.  </li>
            <li>Then most of it washed off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>of most self tanners.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>Love the mit it comes with.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it is just that I have not mastered applying it to my hands yet.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and will use just this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>By day 2, however, it&#x27;s faded and looks better.</li>
            <li>Can still be a man - with a tan..., much better than a tanning booth in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>This product is  way more affordable, if you have doubts just try it, $20 is a bargain</li>
            <li>and you get more than one application out of it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read the application instructions and follow accordingly.</li>
            <li>I actually really love the color of this product and have been using it for about a week now.</li>
            <li>Best self tanner I have ever tried, and I have tried many different kinds.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; helps with even distribution and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many over the years, and this product blows them ALL out of the water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see myself going without this tanner :)</li>
            <li>The foam mit ios genius. :)</li>
            <li>&quot; (gave 4 stars because contrary to most comments, after a day or two, it does have a tinge of orange.</li>
            <li>1- cut 1 inch off the bottom of sprayer tube (helps with the leaking most people report.</li>
            <li>2- make sure you are showered, exfoliated, BUT NOT MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li>If you follow this I promise it will come out better.</li>
            <li>wish they had gallon containers of it :)</li>
            <li>I love applying it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s probably magic)</li>
            <li>I will apply more tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;m glad that I Bought this tanner.</li>
            <li>However, I still wanted a tan because everyone looks and feel better tanned.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>However, the next day I looked like I had been out in the sun the day before and had an awesome tan.</li>
            <li>so just applied more and dressed for work.</li>
            <li>Although it takes too many coats for me to be satisfied with the color</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I think my favorite feature is that there&#x27;s bronzer in it, which means that you can see it as it goes on,</li>
            <li>The applicator mitt allows for an even application every time, and the guide color helps me make sure I don&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li>So glad I looked at reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li>and this is more of a brown versus orange</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen many streaks.</li>
            <li>If it would continue to look like it does before a shower I would like it even better.  </li>
            <li>but I still maintained a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>Better than most</li>
            <li>I have fluorescent white skin but the color ended up looking great!</li>
            <li>and you can also check to make sure everything is coated evenly to avoid blotching or streaks.</li>
            <li>I will say the smell is most of what I like about it.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have already ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, your luck will be better than mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more brown than orange, so it looks more like a suntan than a self-tan.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you shower the morning after you put this stuff on.</li>
            <li>You can see where you apply it too and the mitt is especially handy when doing your back.</li>
            <li>and I will reorder. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried too many others, all in vain.</li>
            <li>used twice a week and keeps a nice light tan color.</li>
            <li>the color was great and didn&#x27;t streak much.  </li>
            <li>I love my self tanner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this tanner...</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a towel in your bed if you decide to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; your tan at night or it will rub off on your sheets.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this tanner.  </li>
            <li>Interesting, because I couldn&#x27;t locate a sell by or use by date anywhere on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The color is the best,,,,,,, no yellow or orange color...</li>
            <li>Most of all I like the smell which has a hint of chocolate.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and the top review</li>
            <li>:) 3.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had many compliments and inquiries as too the amount of time i&#x27;m spending in the sun---</li>
            <li>But the most noticeable downfall is the payout ;it is ok if you don&#x27;t shower......</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They must&#x27;ve been planted cause I&#x27;ve been using self-tanner for years and am always on the lookout for better stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite self tanner, better than St Tropez</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except it did settle into the pores in my lower legs and it looked like I had a lot more freckles than I have</li>
            <li>- I used a q-tip on the darker freckles and the color came off, so I felt better.  </li>
            <li>In the shower, I made sure to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I will take my hard-earned money to a company who deserves it and has better products.    </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and tips and this is an ok product.</li>
            <li>love this product....</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>It does, however, smell much better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>More of a stain than a self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I decided to have an airbrushed tan done hoping for better results...</li>
            <li>I do, however recommend the product itself!pray on tans and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>This is also the 1st tanner that I can apply (gently pat) to my hands &amp; they even turn out great.</li>
            <li>So make sure to apply when you&#x27;ve got time away from all water.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck than I did, but my advice.</li>
            <li>Keep looking elsewhere for a better product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and was even warned about it from a dermatologist until I told him it was a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t wash off most of the tan.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I found it best that after i am done rubbing it in, my last swipes i try to make my hair on my arms/legs &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li>as of now, i&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product and would suggest it to a friend (who knows how to keep secrets)....</li>
            <li>celebrities do it, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>well i just want to look better and healthier</li>
            <li>This product made the light freckles across my shins and ankles POP!  </li>
            <li>and I love the tanning mitt</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure -</li>
            <li>I love this one and the darker one.</li>
            <li>I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>So glad that I found it here at a better price.  </li>
            <li>I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>Im really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the product in the morning and wear it all throughout the day without looking orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love love love this product</li>
            <li>So I ordered this product, after reading MANY reviews, in an attempt to find a substitute for the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Now, I love being able to put a layer or two of this stuff on before going out at night</li>
            <li>As I said before I had read many reviews and decided to trust in those that said all that washes off is some &amp;#34;color guard&amp;#34; or whatever...</li>
            <li>I love this product and plan to continue buying their products.</li>
            <li>and I love the mit to use for application.</li>
            <li>Some of them made me look like an Oompa Loompa, others didn&#x27;t appear to do anything, and others were just okay.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have been using ST TROPEZ mousse for a couple years and love the color</li>
            <li>I love this product, gone</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>LOVE this self tanner for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t been something I&#x27;ve been able to fix.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this tanning spray.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used much better self tanner and of course paid more...</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to not look like a carrot and not smell funky.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look more radiant too since your skin will be hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your mitt and exfoliate 1 time per week.  </li>
            <li>Fake bake flawless is incredible!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is SO MUCH BETTER than any gradual tanning lotion you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt...</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconuts which I love.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions you will have a believable looking tan.</li>
            <li>I love the kae exfoliating hamman glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>In the spring and summer I will do most of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did that and was able to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It is a lot better for your skin than tanning, and a lot better for your lungs than a spray tan.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut and not at all like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!!!!</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it was a spray and not lotion.  </li>
            <li>The Flawless is my second favorite product of their line.</li>
            <li>Flawless is the opposite.</li>
            <li>If my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, one more thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!!for my hair</li>
            <li>I do love that it comes with the mitt to rub it in</li>
            <li>Will reorder :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably every drugstore brand self tanner on the market, and was never even close to being satisfied with any of them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is actually the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried for the price.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is you can see what areas you&#x27;ve tanned because it has color guard.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>the mitt is okay.</li>
            <li>and I am glad its included.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my feet and hands were</li>
            <li>I was in love.</li>
            <li>I have no problems with it rubbing off on my clothing, shaving does take off some of the color, it goes on mostly even too.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a gradual moisturizer would be better since I moisturize every night anyway.</li>
            <li>and make sure to cut the tubing of the sprayer before putting it in the bottle.</li>
            <li>or you may see some spots where there is more color deposited.  </li>
            <li>I have used way too many products and they look and smell</li>
            <li>I love the mitt, however mine got linty, I cleaned it after every use</li>
            <li>Overall the best tanner I have used and</li>
            <li>but now she uses this too and loves it. :))</li>
            <li>&gt; When applying this product, you have to make sure your spread it out immediately after you spray</li>
            <li>I am looking for something that lasts more then a day.</li>
            <li>it would work the best for future uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love</li>
            <li>I say more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was my family</li>
            <li>I was around because I would&#x27;ve been even more embarrassed if I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look like you&#x27;ve been to the bed many times.</li>
            <li>You will never get it on your hands and can rub gently on top of hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner for years and although you seem to have to re apply it daily it works great!</li>
            <li>But still looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>Guys, I seriously LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>On the way home from my vacation I made sure to tighten the lid</li>
            <li>but yet somehow it leaked again, but I placed the bottle away from clothing, but if I wouldn&#x27;t have done that I would&#x27;ve ruined more clothes.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this much better than the chemical smell of most self-tanners.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried many self tan brands .</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a klutz but was able to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li>This product pleased on all levels.  </li>
            <li>and this gives me a better looking tan than the one I had 10 years ago when I faithfully went to a tanning bed all summer, and that&#x27;s after just one application.  </li>
            <li>it would look ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing better</li>
            <li>Love it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that</li>
            <li>I have used lots of self tanners and this one is okay.</li>
            <li>So glad I Purchased This.</li>
            <li>I put it on twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li>and you end up using more, but anyways.</li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>She stated that it is not her favorite bend though.</li>
            <li>but the lotion works much better.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin look so much more even.</li>
            <li>Ok just applied tonight.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re able to control the amount of tan you want on you.</li>
            <li>I love this self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the mitt.</li>
            <li>and i love the glove applicator.</li>
            <li>WHAT YOU WANT,MAY BE ABLE TO LAYER</li>
            <li>SURE WHY PEOPLE SAID IT CAME OFF ON SHEETS,</li>
            <li>AND I TRYED SCRUBBING LIGHTER IN SHOWER TO AVOID MORE FADE,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and still love it.</li>
            <li>, you look better that way\\&quot; As furious as i was i did my research for a spray on tanner because at the tanning salons it ALWAYS makes you orange.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Instant flawless tan, no streaks!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to others &amp; they too love this product.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle because I&#x27;m in love with this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get it! :)</li>
            <li>NO nasty smell.</li>
            <li>The color is OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cotton balls, and that works better than the mitt.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE the  color for spring.</li>
            <li>; hahaha i really am so happy i bought this stuff</li>
            <li>for up to a week or more.</li>
            <li>Either way, you will see INSTANT tanning with this awesome stuff....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product :)</li>
            <li>Which I am sure I don&#x27;t  this product turned me into a darn carrot.</li>
            <li>so I could wear a short dress to a wedding, and it was perfect!!</li>
            <li>Like, the top of my arm all the way around, then bottom of my arm, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am puzzled as to why so many people like this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to bend your joints (elbows, knees, knuckles, etc.)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you will be able to see lighter lines when you bend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I like the results even better than a spray tan.</li>
            <li>Ok product</li>
            <li>Wish the glove stayed on better</li>
            <li>mit made the application very easy and it was easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I seen it with my own two eyes this stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>But what is nice about this is that you can see it right as you apply it &amp; it isn&#x27;t any kind of funky orange looking.</li>
            <li>It gives you some immediate color which is good for seeing where you are working and buffing out any lines not to mention if you are putting it on right before going out</li>
            <li>but it washes off right away and continues to wash off, making it good for the day you put it on.</li>
            <li>I use this right before bed and wake up with a gorgeous glow.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for many reasons: it goes on incredibly even; especially if you use the mitt, it has a pleasant smell- sort of cocunuty or tropical like a nice sunscreen, and it gives an AMAZING instant tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nice scent is probably one of the thing I am most excited about, and that it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to sheets/</li>
            <li>Bake Flawless has given me a natural tan that is easy to apply, easy to maintain</li>
            <li>color isn&#x27;t as great as I would&#x27;ve wanted..or have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>it is a nice bronze, and so easy to apply and dries very quickly too.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li>it should be called REAL BAKE!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this self-tanner and try it.  </li>
            <li>application is simple (even for a non-beauty nut like myself), the color is natural-looking, and the smell is very nice!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It is a nice golden brown tan!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>so I can show off my beautiful natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>So this was also a reason why I was excited because with me running my own business</li>
            <li>It is a nice golden color!</li>
            <li>Excellent product: quick, natural looking color that doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes!</li>
            <li>No mess, it dries very quickly, it has a pleasant smell, and best of all my husband loves my new glow!</li>
            <li>When you shower, the color guard comes off and leaves a nice, clean look.</li>
            <li>As long as you exfoliate good and put it on evenly then it will look great.</li>
            <li>easy, fast, and perfect golden color.</li>
            <li>First, let me say this is absolutely the best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy after application, and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>First off love this product works really good</li>
            <li>This product definitely leaves your skin with a beautiful, warm color.</li>
            <li>I loved that this product came with a mitt, also loved that it was in spray form because it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>The foam glove makes it very easy to apply in an even streak free manor.</li>
            <li>Great product, only problem is the glove needs to be bigger/longer or either more form fitting!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tanning products and this one is by far one of the best, at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Great way to relieve yourself of high sun exposures once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes of this being a great product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate and moisturize before using and apply to clean skin!</li>
            <li>As mentioned in another comment, make sure to clean your mitt with water after every use!</li>
            <li>the mits wear quickly and i had to use a sponge paint brush to apply it afterwards, but I still love this product!</li>
            <li>Even the super pricey ones, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use often, but it&#x27;s nice for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>So I say if you want a nice glow for a special occasion, go for it.</li>
            <li>A nice light brown, did not rub off on my clothes and was easy to apply with the mitt included in the box.</li>
            <li>Great color, easy application, really lasts.</li>
            <li>I love how easily it goes on and love the color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I found that using this at night is best - shower, shave, exfoliate and make sure you are completely dry.</li>
            <li>does exaclty what it says, turns you a beatuiful golden brown, smells great and dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product was easy to apply and would recommend this for anyone looking the a quick tan look!!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely blown away by this product and could not believe the amazing results!</li>
            <li>This has a really nice tan cool tone.</li>
            <li>and it looks as good as it did the first day I put it</li>
            <li>this self tanner is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Loved at first.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of them &amp; this one works best, dries fast, smells nice &amp; looks natural.</li>
            <li>It is my first time using a self tanner and this has been a good experience.</li>
            <li>I had to do 3 applications before achieving a beautiful, natural looking radiant tan.</li>
            <li>i was really pleasantly surprised when 5 minutes after applying this, i looked in the mirror and saw beautifully tanned-relaxed-just stepped-of-that-boat-in-st-tropez girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good color, although spray application tends to be drippy/messy</li>
            <li>This self tanner works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Leaves a pretty good tan.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good tanner if you like sprays.</li>
            <li>This is true at the beginning as it has a nice tropical smell.  </li>
            <li>: The color guard in this product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>bummer..seemed pretty good before.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best out there without the strange tanner smell others have.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good self tanner.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned too.</li>
            <li>it turns you  a natural golden brown not a hint of orange :) and that i was very happy about .</li>
            <li>Besides that, it works and looks pretty good for about 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>She looked pretty good after one application.  </li>
            <li>but its pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sweet when you put it on.</li>
            <li>This product does not stain my clothes or my bedding, smells pretty good</li>
            <li>and I have pretty fair skin in winter.</li>
            <li>I can put it on my face and arms well, and it looks really pretty good.</li>
            <li>so this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good color, not orange at all</li>
            <li>The color this Tanner gives is beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>Gives a beautiful natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Also, it keeps up pretty darn good if you are in the water.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and melanoma runs in my family</li>
            <li>and I have loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and am happy with the natural glow it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled it, it didn&#x27;t seem that strong, in fact it smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li>nice and refreshing after shower on a hot day!</li>
            <li>I get the best results by exfoliating always and using the handy little mitt that comes with.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I went to work the next day and everyone was complimenting me on how great my tan looked, I just kind of laughed to myself.</li>
            <li>Mitt: Easy, easy, easy application!</li>
            <li>so I stopped using the mitt and just started using my hand or gloves and mixed this product with Sun Lab tanning, and the results are amazing!!</li>
            <li>Lastly the smell of this product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried in a long time!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s defienelt worth the buy !!</li>
            <li>So first of all i must say i absolutely love love love this product!</li>
            <li>The color is awesome and it lasts for a long while!</li>
            <li>I bought this item and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the next best thing to an airbrush tan that I have found, and much more friendly on the wallet.</li>
            <li>it only takes one application to get nice and tan!!</li>
            <li>also the new jergens self tan (smells like perfume when applying) both have been great products.</li>
            <li>Smells great, looks fantastic and really lasts a while when you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great no marks or anything :) it looks really natural on.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of my favorite self tanners, it does not turn you orange, easy application with the mitt</li>
            <li>it is easy but you may pick up a couple tips :)</li>
            <li>Its so easy to apply just make sure you spray the mit not your skin.</li>
            <li>I am super super fair skinned, and this spray turns me into a light brown tan person!</li>
            <li>I do have to do it twice to get the color I like, but just once gives a nice glow that is super wearable.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, effortlessly and smells FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>The smell could be better (smells like suntan lotion), but not as strong as some others I have used.</li>
            <li>yeah, it kind of defeated the purpose of a quick spray on tan.</li>
            <li>Very coconut-y and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>love that this stuff is easy to put on (using the mitt</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with mitt, a friend suggested this product to me and I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>No streaks, easy application, no terrible scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and really lovely results.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the results are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong self tanner odor, like most I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as most tanners.</li>
            <li>I find that exfoliating with a loofa (while showering), then applying and wait for it to dry, then moisturizing is the best process for even color and locking it it.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner odor.</li>
            <li>The mitt makes everything blend in so easily, and if you are nervous about it, there are many videos on YouTube that show you how to apply.</li>
            <li>love the smell and color easy application.</li>
            <li>Love this product, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to exfoliate and shave well then apply it after a shower when your skin is towel dry</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to apply and that it goes on evenly&amp;#62; I just wish it got me &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great bronzer that develops immediately and honestly has me applying it daily just to have that bronzed</li>
            <li>so I mixed the spray with lotion, worked GREAT, nice even coverage.  </li>
            <li>flawless really looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 different tanning products on Amazon, based on good reviews, and this one is so good.</li>
            <li>Let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Apply sunless solution as per the directions, using the gloves and the mitt, spraying on the mitt and then LIGHTLY buffing the color all over (it&#x27;s probably best to put a tiny dab of body lotion on your knees and elbows and ankles).&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and gets you really tan really fast.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about it is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>The color pay off is good with this one, just make sure you moisturize after it develops because it really drys out your skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product easy to use and very natural looking!</li>
            <li>The color this produces is great (very natural).  </li>
            <li>The mitt is also very soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>Great color very natural even after just 1 use, I will but again</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m fair-skinned and it looks very natural on me)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great - coconut/tropical scent</li>
            <li>I love love love this so much I am buying more!</li>
            <li>This tanner gives a very natural tan that looks great on all skin tones.</li>
            <li>The application (for me) is flawless every single time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>Great product that looks natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands of self tanner for my legs because for some reason the rest of my body gets a beautiful tan, but my legs don&#x27;t :</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, will be ordering more, exactly as described, the color is gorgeous and it lasts  for a good&lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and gives a beautiful natural glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to put on and looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>looks more natural and wears better!!  </li>
            <li>The spray goes on very smoothly and evenly, and dries almost immediately for a lightweight, light colored glow.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this item and would recommend it to anyone who needed a quick convenient tan!</li>
            <li>I love how quickly the color shows up!</li>
            <li>The best feature is it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other tanners.  </li>
            <li>, it was a deep rich brown color on me, it was perfect....</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it smells good, and it is easy to apply with the mitt.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 pumps, the liquid leaked large, brown splotches everywhere - it&#x27;s a good thing I was spraying the mitt over the sink.</li>
            <li>Goes on so easy without hassle, absorbs quickly, and without steaks of any kind.</li>
            <li>Easy application, nice color (not orangey at all) and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have Irish skin, very fair with freckles</li>
            <li>Mitt that comes with it is very good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very very good, it reminds me of vanilla mixed with coconut</li>
            <li>I am a very fair skinned red head.</li>
            <li>By the way I am a very fair skinned Red Head!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is the only self tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange as I am very fair.</li>
            <li>but I will only purchase again if I find it at a very good price.</li>
            <li>The color payoff is very good as well, but I would only recommend this to darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easy, blends amazingly well and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>Great color, very easy to apply evenly (wash the give after each use) but color doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Worked great, loooked very natural easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on easy, dries pretty quickly, and looks great..</li>
            <li>I was able to put this on in the morning and wear it all day and wasn&#x27;t bothered at all by the fragrance which is a HUGE deal for me.</li>
            <li>glad this available.  </li>
            <li>It came way before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Since I cannot tan naturally, and I also don&#x27;t want the harmful effects of tanning, I am always looking for a great self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Love this...easy to apply looks good and more like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful almost instant beach glow I get!</li>
            <li>It was a perfect transaction and it arrived just as expected.</li>
            <li>I use this one on my face too, I spray a light amount on a foundation spounge and rub it on in circular motions making sure I get my hair line and under my chin evenly.</li>
            <li>&amp; i also use tanning face cloths by another brand for my face, i don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on face even though it says its okay.</li>
            <li>The mitt isnt the best for applying either as the fluff of the mitt comes off on your skin.</li>
            <li>Gives a great, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t let the color sink in at all, so it&#x27;s better to not put anything and just lightly pass the mitt over these areas.</li>
            <li>And most importantly you can control the amount of tan you want.</li>
            <li>Great, natural color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how the fake bake looks on my skin, and when i tried the flawless finish i was happy with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice vanilla beach scent and you can tell that the mitt that comes along with this product is made of  higher quality than most.</li>
            <li>I will be using the product again this Friday and probably once a week throughout summer and into fall as it makes me feel much more comfortable in sleeveless tanks or shorts.</li>
            <li>Goes on SO smooth &amp; so much easier than any kind of lotion!</li>
            <li>Gives a great, natural tan</li>
            <li>The most important thing is to shave, exfoliate and do not leave any moisturizer on your skin unless you DON&amp;#34;T want the color to stay.  </li>
            <li>Great product looks really natural</li>
            <li>The mitt works great and goes on even and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Great natural looking tan, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, which is not something you can say about many self-tanners.</li>
            <li>The price was dirt cheap, however, Im glad I went ahead and gave it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great natural look.</li>
            <li>Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions of going lightly over knees and ankles, making sure they were extended</li>
            <li>People are always saying &amp;#34; wow do you have a great tan&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I found spraying the mitt then applying gave me beautiful complete smooth coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>But be sure to just snip about a inch off it so it will fit in the bottle smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is relatively cheap and love that it comes with a mitt.</li>
            <li>the mit offers a great application</li>
            <li>After a week, I had a great natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>and I wished the color could have been darker, but it was fairly natural and not streaky, so I am happy with that.</li>
            <li>Best thing I have ever spent my money on.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product with a natural color</li>
            <li>Great natural bronzed look without streaking.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel like this was more than worth my money, and if you want it to work, you have to be patient and do what it recommends in the directions for the best result!!</li>
            <li>Great product, I used to airbrush but the place near me moved</li>
            <li>To me the most important characteristics of a sunless tanner is smell, color, and ease of application.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great non streaking and natural looking spray tan just stop here, you found it.  </li>
            <li>The best of times with those products even with the utmost careful application was always given away by ONE DAMN SPOT.  </li>
            <li>I had absolutely no streaking at all with this product which is wonderful considering</li>
            <li>Probably great for unblemished skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on my skin smoothly and is safe on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li>She always has such a beautiful and healthy looking glow to her skin, so I immediately did my investigating on Amazon.</li>
            <li>NICE LIGHT SWEET SMELL&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure to exfoliate, then shave and of course, lotion up with something light.  </li>
            <li>Put it on the night before my college graduation and turned my body a nice golden tan, instead of a smelly carrot.  </li>
            <li>I had a nice golden tan ....</li>
            <li>Good for a days use when you wont sweat much.</li>
            <li>I do believe that people&#x27;s skin PH has to do with tanning results, but honestly it is soo worth the try.</li>
            <li>REALLY good advice because the mitt absorbs too much for legs, for example.  </li>
            <li>Delivers a nice golden brown color immediately.  </li>
            <li>I just reordered and used it, and it was good, but I did not notice much color this time.  </li>
            <li>The mitt it comes with is GREAT - it really helps smooth the product on evenly - no streaks or runs, just smooth application.</li>
            <li>WOW loved this product, nothing close to orange, perfect balance, the tan develops to MATCH your individual skin tone, and my problem area had always been around my ankles and face.</li>
            <li>it smells good and drys fast  </li>
            <li>* If you like having a guide color this is a good one as it doesn&#x27;t transfer too much.</li>
            <li>and you have a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>and it gave me a nice golden brown colour.</li>
            <li>Gives nice golden color, not orange.</li>
            <li>couldnt really get how to make this look good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice golden brown, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>It smells SO good - very tropical.</li>
            <li>I loved my tan so much.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and smells really good for a self tanner.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and looks real.</li>
            <li>and then my skin starts to peel and the tan goes away, so I NEVER get a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a nice golden brown color.</li>
            <li>Good price – very affordable&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little darker, but this color guard is beautiful and great for adding quick color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY self-tanners and this is hands down, the best!</li>
            <li>This product is very cost effective, dries very quickly, and smells better than most tanning products.</li>
            <li>The price is right too!!</li>
            <li>The color looks great, and while it may stain clothes the first day, it comes right out when you wash it.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li>I have used many self less tanning products and always an orange hugh, but this is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Great product and super fast arrival.</li>
            <li>I used it during the wintertime (I live in North Idaho) and people were baffled and jealous of my tan :p</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and the price was right.</li>
            <li>the color looked amazing on my body right away</li>
            <li>have found if I use it after a shower right before I go out it does give me a nice tan look, I just have to reapply each time I go out.</li>
            <li>Color is good, I found two days in a row and my white body was the best, three got a little blotchy around wrist and ankles no matter how good my application was.</li>
            <li>it goes on easy and instant color perfect for a night out or quick tan</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply evenly, the color is natural looking and the smell is pleasant, unlike most sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li>This gives me a nice light sun kissed look with no hassle and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The application was the only thing I loved about this (LOVE the mitt!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, the glove , fast shipping....everything but that spray bottle top!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>The best thing about fake bake flawless is that it dries very, very fast.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice natural brown color and a color guide that allows you to see where you have tanned.</li>
            <li>Not only did it give me a gorgeous golden brown tan, but it is also extremely easy to use, very lightweight, and smells great!  </li>
            <li>I like the original formula much better.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The mitt makes it super easy to apply and with no streaks!</li>
            <li>I even love the smell, and it is fun putting it on!</li>
            <li>Super easy!  </li>
            <li>other than that, its awesome!</li>
            <li>so when I saw this one I was excited so many reviews.</li>
            <li>But If you cleanse properly you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li>Other than leaving pore marks its great!</li>
            <li>First of all, how can you ask for a better price on a self tanner!?</li>
            <li>Original seems to be more of a once-a-week application as it is darker and thicker.</li>
            <li>Everything about this product is true!  </li>
            <li>but I really truely suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li>First off, I love the smell!</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Almost finished with my first bottle :) Lasts forever!</li>
            <li>But overall really good!</li>
            <li>I was complemented several time on how good my tan looked!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product from all the other name there is in the market.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the package and recommendations of other reviewers: exfoliation, blending balm, gloves &amp; mit (they come with FakeBake Flawless), and I use Malibu Hemp Firming Lotion with gradual tanner in it- daily(Walmart).</li>
            <li>Super easy to use just spray and rub and done!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange, like other products do.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the original FB &amp; figured this would be better which it is.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is great!</li>
            <li>I have used other products of this nature and found this to be the best.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that i love this product!</li>
            <li>It actually smells good!  </li>
            <li>All in all the products beats being a slave to the (killer) tanning beds but requires more at home maintenance than I originally thought it would</li>

            <li>It is very easy to apply, the aroma is pleasant, it dries quickly and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>&amp; This particular seller (123 Skincare) has the most outstanding customer service I have ever had the pleasure of being served!</li>
            <li>When I applied this product I noticed it had a very nice smell, unlike many other self tanners and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok, because I have a special bed sheet that protects my mattress but FYI to those that dont.</li>
            <li>The tanning spray smells good but not strong at all which is great.</li>
            <li>Loved this product when I first received and used it, but it fades way to quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good results, quick dry, no fuss, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>, To my surprise it was all I ever wanted and more, the smell is very mild and has a sort of tropical smell to it but not overpowering, I love the spray, I just have to work fast and rub from top to bottom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and several of my friends are already ordering it because they really liked the look.</li>
            <li>It looked amazing at first.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product smells amazingly tropical.</li>
            <li>It already has amazing reviews and after my first use I see why.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and definitely not the most skilled person out there at applying tanners.</li>
            <li>but this stuff (with just one application every couple of days) gives me a good normal looking skin tone.</li>
            <li>first I put on lotion on my face then 3 Sparys of the tanner it gives my body a nice glow and smells like coconuts yummy</li>
            <li>but you are still left with beautiful color.  </li>
            <li>and Sat I applied the tanner, took a shower the next day and by Sunday I had a beautiful all-over bronze.</li>
            <li>This is my first use of any kind of tanner including the sun.</li>
            <li>No big deal, I just repeated the process, and was beautifully tan again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I applied the product by myself and was able to reach most areas, but you may want to have a friend or loved one help you do your back if you plan on wearing something that exposes it.</li>
            <li>With only one application that ended up lasting a good week this gave the perfect color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had beautiful, even, color all over my body within ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I used this and although the color came out nice at first...</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and some of the tips from others and got a nice, even color with the first application.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it fades pretty nicely and lasted me about 8-10 days.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and actually smells really good!  </li>
            <li>this gave me a flawless dark glow to start the summer off with.</li>
            <li>Stuff works pretty damn good, and doesn&#x27;t make me orange, just make sure you scrape off your skin first</li>
            <li>The glove makes for perfect coverage, no creases or dark spots.</li>
            <li>, I can build up a pretty nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Followed directions for application, went on beautifully, washed off in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li>After experimenting and so much research about the perfect tan I can across fake bake flawless and million dollar tan icon.</li>
            <li>When I apply the tanner, I get an instant, beautiful colored tan.</li>
            <li>Perfect dark tan.</li>
            <li>smell is fine, its not too strong or too bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and actually looks like a tan.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but since this was a beauty product and I am all about sharing with anyone who will listen about good products...</li>
            <li>(not bad but is overwhelming).</li>
            <li>Just run it under water and the tanner comes right out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Sellers were very easy right work with.</li>
            <li>I liked the Fake Bake Flawless because it gives a beautiful, realistic tan glow.</li>
            <li>Unlike most self tanners, this tanner gives you a nice realistic tan.  </li>

            <li>; My arms look fine, but legs not so much.(did exfoliate)</li>
            <li>It does come off onto light colored clothing, but washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I allowed the color to sit for a couple hours before going to bed, but it still stained my bedsheets; it washed out fine, but I&#x27;d suggest putting something over your sheets just in case.   </li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>easy application, streak free results, never buying anything else for tanning again.</li>
            <li>i look like a gay fish</li>
            <li>It is a pain to do, but otherwise the tanner dries and hardens the mitten and the application isn&#x27;t as easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>but my oils work fine.)</li>
            <li>but my oils work fine.)</li>
            <li>The colour is fantastic and the product dries easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply but the color payoff was so light</li>
            <li>everything has washed up fine.</li>
            <li>I love it, doesn&#x27;t look orange, but you need to make sure your skin is clean and you&#x27;re freshly shaven</li>
            <li>The color lasts for a couple days but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>The mit makes things really smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>This one smells fine, but every time I used it I turned orange, NOT brown.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write many reviews, but this product is deserving.</li>
            <li>the instructions say and you will be fine</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The guard works fine</li>
            <li>I washed my face that night and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Everything turned out fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Unscented would be just fine with me.  </li>
            <li>so i just got a darker makeup and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>I reapply about twice a week, and it takes so much less time than driving to a tanning salon :D  </li>
            <li>This is a light smell that is easily masked if you want to tan in the morning instead of night.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners and would rate this higher than most.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The whole-body application process takes me less than 10 minutes, and I always end up with flawless results.</li>
            <li>the non aerosol spray is easy to use, it has a nice tropical scent, a gorgeous, believable color, quick dry time, and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, sheets, etc.</li>
            <li>the smell is fine.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>and packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>Natural color, easy to apply, dries quick and smells great.</li>
            <li>I used the product last night for the first time and it was effortless and the results are truly flawless.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and easy.  </li>
            <li>but it comes out just fine after going through the wash</li>
            <li>The mitt works fine, and I wash it out thoroughly in between uses.</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best self tanner I have ever tried, and I normally dont like them.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>And it smells super tropical which I love.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut smell and how quickly the product absorbs.</li>
            <li>drys quickly,  and truly no streaking!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also really pleased with how quickly I can apply this product.</li>
            <li>quickly I rec&#x27;d my stuff!</li>
            <li>I love that it bronzes your skin as you apply, so you can see where its going and quickly even out the color to avoid streaks and blotches.</li>
            <li>So it works, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemistry set as most seem to and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Has a strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It is super to apply no steaks and doesn&#x27;t rub or melt off!</li>
            <li>I also love that it dries so quickly, so none of the product gets on clothes or on your sheets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Tan Towels, Quick drench,Banana Boat,L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze,and Neutrogena Sunless tan products.</li>
            <li>I use this product mostly on my face/neck area because those are the areas that fade quickly on my body.</li>
            <li>Then on it goes (it dries quickly too!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends who use it loyally now as well.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this tanner (besides the super yummy smell) is the dying time.</li>
            <li>This product is super legit!</li>
            <li>Love the color of this product and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The color on my face fades much more quickly than it does on my body though.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it dries and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; like the others often do.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly on your skin but still has a tanning lotion smell but its not terrible.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose my tan!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Pleasant smell – no harsh chemical smell</li>
            <li>I did like it, but thought this product might be better since it dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be ok now, you just have to spray and rub the product in quick (or find whatever works for your body/skin).</li>
            <li>And I got it so quick with Amazon!</li>
            <li>The mousse is more of a quick, on-the-go product.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and very natural looking...</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best self tanner available.</li>
            <li>For reference I have an odd combination of skin traits I am very fair because I spend most days inside</li>
            <li>Great color that look very natural and pretty!</li>
            <li>There is an abundant amount of positive costumer feedback about this product so I am hoping it was just a defective bottle.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, smells nice, came quickly, gave nice natural color.</li>
            <li>Creates a gorgeous all-over body tan that looks natural and not orange!</li>
            <li>It even looks good on my feet, and that to me, is the hardest area to make look natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, gently exfoliating twice a week and putting more product on, and it looks just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li>This product is every bit as good as anything used in a professional tanning salon!</li>
            <li>You absolutely need to wear the gloves and get more from amazon, you&#x27;ll need them!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and natural!</li>
            <li>Love it and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It makes me skin look very tan and healthy!</li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this product!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite to date!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, gives you a nice color right away, dries lightning fast, didn&#x27;t transfer onto any of my clothes or sheets, isn&#x27;t ORANGE.</li>
            <li>The only sunless tanner I ever used before this was Jergen&#x27;s gradual tanning lotion (which doesn&#x27;t smell great and gets streaky easily).</li>
            <li>Easy, fast, nice color that lasts about a week for me.</li>
            <li>It only takes a minute and it will make each time you use it a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a pleasant smell while applying, but that I don&#x27;t smell like the faux tan later.</li>
            <li>great for a last minute &#x27;tan&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, easy</li>
            <li>I get a nice golden glow quickly and evenly in no time.  </li>
            <li>nice smell, easy application, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really is the most reliable self-tanner out there, so if you&#x27;re new or or nervous or just looking for a great deal, you have my recommendation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin has a nice golden glow!</li>
            <li>I just purchased their Flawless Dark, excited to see how that product turns out as well.</li>
            <li>No need for fancy scrubs, use a cheap one and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy with the mitt, works instantly, doesn&#x27;t streak, looks 100% real, gives impressive results with one application, and smells like a freaking island paradise.</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel white and in need of some glow, this is perfect and puts on really fast and easy.</li>
            <li>but if you have somewhat of a light tan or any hint of being in the sun, you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a friend who is VERY fair skinned that it looks a little orange if she is in a hurry, but over all I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Had a very strong bronzer, I looked orange for hours after application, but was willing to deal with it.</li>
            <li>All I can say wow what a good color tan not Oregon at all just a good tan color,  and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Other than that, product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Always make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li>A little too perfect of a tan.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the application mitt and how much easier it makes the tanning process!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, and works amazing first time buying this</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned naturally, and I am cautious about how much sun exposure I get because there is a history of melanoma in my family.</li>
            <li>I am VERY satisfied with this product so far!!</li>
            <li>Best part from having a quick, streakfree tan, is that when it wears off, it doesn&#x27;t leave you blotchy like other spray tan methods do.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best self tanner available hands down!</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very new to this product, but I really do love it!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li>It was very fast and easy!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak..</li>
            <li>Which was a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li>I like the mitt that comes with it because it makes applying the spray easier and blends it in nicely for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliated when I showered at night, and then took one more shower in the morning, scrubbed the rough spots to even things out a bit, came out looking great :</li>
            <li>was the most amazing, natural bronze tan.</li>
            <li>but it was a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li>and that is a huge pet peeve of mine with FakeBake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>description was accurate arrived promptly through amazon shipping</li>
            <li>this is by far the best tanning spray you will ever use aloge with xen tan blending balm looks like a natural tan without the damage of the sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak..</li>
            <li>but they can be a huge pain to apply.</li>
            <li>Then after some research this is what I found, and after I followed it it was a HUGE HUGE sigh of relief.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used this tanner and haven&#x27;t broke out at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This by far is the most amazing self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best self-tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used --- You have complete control over where it goes</li>
            <li>so I make a huge effort to stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li>it fades smoothly and not in blotches.</li>
            <li>I have light gray sheets</li>
            <li>It will be nice to have a tan in the winter when I can&#x27;t get out so much.</li>
            <li>The color guide is a nice bronze, but when it washes off, the whole tan seems to go with it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and looks immediately tan.</li>
            <li>So silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a light hand when applying</li>
            <li>I feel like if you enjoy liquid tanners, you will enjoy this</li>
            <li>Streak free.</li>
            <li>So I used it for 3 days on my legs and upper arms and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self-tanner products and this one is probably the best one yet.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use light circles</li>
            <li>Then I observed my hairdresser with a lovely golden glow.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great self tanner.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on really well and leaves a nice color.</li>
            <li>Color was great and instant!</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times, and it is the best!</li>
            <li>It is not, however, fool proof - I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and yet found some streaky places and grubbiness on the knees, but as I applied it in the wee hours in not-the-brightest light, I will chalk that up to user error.</li>
            <li>The kit does it&#x27;s job and makes things streak free.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I forbid tanning beds even though she works at a gym and gets free use.  </li>
            <li>I did not even scrub my skin, I rinsed it lightly with baby wash.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and streak free.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the mitt, so most of the tanner is absorbed into the mitt, not on your skin.</li>
            <li>A coworker who owns her own tanning bed was absolutely gobsmacked to find out I was using a self-tanner and not visiting a tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I was hooked - now a dozen or so boxes later, I&#x27;m still just as happy.  </li>
            <li>I started using the plastic disposable latex gloves (box of 100 is so cheap).  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and it applies light brown so you can see if you&#x27;ve missed any spots.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great this looks, especially considering the price!  </li>
            <li>It gives a fantastic color.</li>
            <li>The stuff gives you a great looking tan which last for days.  </li>
            <li>I only used it on my legs and it looks great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use in the winter time, but not enough color for the summer.  </li>
            <li>Wore my shorts the next day and felt and looked great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how fabulous this product went on.</li>
            <li>B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]] has been by far the best of the bunch I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>reference, I&#x27;m of Southeastern descent with naturally light medium beige skin.</li>
            <li>Also it is important to shave and exfoliate before use.</li>
            <li>also really enjoy the color.</li>
            <li>My skin never sees the light of day without sunscreen.</li>
            <li>streak free, and covers well, with natural&lt;br /&gt;cover and color, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried light spray tans, tanning lotions, pills you name it.</li>
            <li>are this cheap and 4.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it stays fantastic as the hours go by.</li>
            <li>Not with this product though - I like how smooth and even my chests</li>
            <li>Worth every penny :)</li>
            <li>but from there on its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Light eyes and light hair...</li>
            <li>does show on the sheets if they are light when you apply at bedtime</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with the mitt and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>I applied it a few times for a week and was not too impressed.</li>
            <li>Honestly did not expect to like this tanner as much as I do...</li>
            <li>:) Normally I don&#x27;t go for bronzers, but in this case it is a beautiful, light brown, somewhat translucent and natural looking shade</li>
            <li>I do one light spray on to the mitt, and apply it where the sun would darken my face.</li>
            <li>In the morning I shower, rubbing my skin with just my hand, and do any light touch ups I might need.</li>
            <li>mitt is fantastic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several faux tan products, not being happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>great instant tan.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this came as a surprise because their tan looked genuine.</li>
            <li>that this comes with a mit for free</li>
            <li>It does take more work to buff into the skin compared to a mouses but the color it leaves is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous....</li>
            <li>When I saw the material of the Baiden mitten, I knew that the Korean Italy cloths that I had grown up with would do the trick every bit as well, but for a fraction of the cost (you can buy them in any Korean market, or buy one on eBay for $1.15 + free shipping, versus paying $50 for the Baiden mitten).</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly without leaving you orange.</li>
            <li>I am so silky smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li>another important step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the price is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I have a light to med olive  complexion and when I tan in the beach</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and you can see immediately where the color is.</li>
            <li>Only one application and my legs looked great.</li>
            <li>It was always splotchy in the sunlight, and filled in my pores.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t show lines.</li>
            <li>i think i used it 3 days in a row and then maintain it with a cheap gradual lotion tanner once a day from Ulta.</li>
            <li>Just spray it on and LIGHTLY spread the spray with the application pad.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my face.  </li>
            <li>This color is not orange at all, but more so GOLDEN BROWN.</li>
            <li>mid week with the lotion is a great combination.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend showering, shaving, exfoliating and lightly moisturing before using this product.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t too much and the color is nice... not orange.  </li>
            <li>You spray the product onto the mitt and apply to your skin using circular motion to avoid streaking and making sure it&#x27;s absorbed onto the skin evenly.  </li>
            <li>A horrid color for someone with naturally light skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to lightly go over your hands and feet and bend your arms</li>
            <li>Smooth application</li>
            <li>like I do..go lightly with the product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without streaking or looking blotchy,&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li>many products have that distinct self-tanner smell that you want to wash off as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>That is always a concern for me if I am wearing light color clothes in the summer.</li>
            <li>I liked this product very well.  </li>
            <li>5 minutes later she bought it lol.</li>
            <li>great for a last minute event that you want to look bronze for overnight!</li>
            <li>It may sound like there isn&#x27;t a lot in the (smallest) bottle</li>
            <li>It would be great if you don&#x27;t like actually going into the pool and just wanna sit on the side...</li>
            <li>Really natural color, love love love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that even though it smells great (coconut)</li>
            <li>I does a terrific job and the color is great.  </li>
            <li>Scent is fantastic, but not overpowering&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I then jump in the shower and lightly wash it off.  </li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it as I apply it, but it still applies smoothly and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use if you just want some color for an event, but if you are looking for something to maintain color over time, you would have to reapply this one almost daily.</li>
            <li>This went on extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t make me look orange at all.</li>
            <li>I have been trying many many tan products for my upcoming wedding and this one gives the most natural color.</li>
            <li>Overall great product for the price.</li>
            <li>It applies so even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Stained everything light</li>
            <li>&amp; I may be spraying too lightly each time onto the mitt</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to lightly buff the product on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m adding this edit to emphasize how important it is to wash your mitten between uses.</li>
            <li>So we&#x27;ll see how it works on paler skin because with banana boat i had boughten it last summer and it looked great over an already tan body but</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly &amp; evenly.</li>
            <li>works well, color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>or if you just want a light coverage.</li>
            <li>Why it wasn&#x27;t available in the US, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was left with great color.  </li>
            <li>I have my roommate do my back and the back of my shoulders and legs just to make sure it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
            <li>It was a cheap immitation of a liquid/spray tanning solution.</li>
            <li>you can try to get a light sun tan.</li>
            <li>Followed someone&#x27;s advice; by using scrubbing gloves during shower, then applying to the mitt and rubbing lightly on skin.  </li>
            <li>Great color payoff after second application.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT  and WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li>but i did on my hands since it was not going on smoothly and</li>
            <li>I watched a few Youtube videos on how to get the best coverage and application.  </li>
            <li>Great for the sudden need of a tan.</li>
            <li>and to keep it in one place &amp; easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>and i dont mind reapplying everyday because it smells great!</li>
            <li>The overall idea of this product is great.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great and gives instant bronzers so you can literally apply it and then walk out the door.</li>
            <li>This stuff is beyond fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic to use for an event, night out, wedding, etc.</li>
            <li>I took my gloves off and lightly went over my hands.</li>
            <li>Goes on streak free</li>
            <li>It actually works, looks great with no streaking.</li>
            <li>I went to bed and slept comfortably throughout the night and in the morning there were no stains on my sheets.</li>
            <li>and I was left with a great tan and no smell</li>
            <li>This selftanner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The end result is great, until 2-3 days later.</li>
            <li>This product was really great especially in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I was so smooth but</li>
            <li>i used the spray nasal after trimming the tube to fit the bottle.</li>
            <li>in the morning i washed my face with a gentle cleanser in the shower and the color looked amazing and did not make my acne scars stand out the way it did the night before.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin tone</li>
            <li>Im applying lightly twice a week to maintain and using Jergans gradual tan lotion in light on the off days.</li>
            <li>The color-guiding bronzer does not wash off in the shower if you do a light rinse/wash.</li>
            <li>Great tanner, red undertones, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>, the mitt is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but  not as smooth as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I recommend just NOT using it on your elbows or knees, or just EVER so stinking lightly.</li>
            <li>take your time and do it with plenty of advanced notice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few sunless tanners and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not orange looking and smells fantastic...</li>
            <li>People keep asking me where I have been to get such a great looking tan.</li>
            <li>And the mitt is cheap.</li>
            <li>It was virtually streak free.</li>
            <li>Both could have fit in the package together and saved on postage.  </li>
            <li>Its do fast and looks amazing every time.</li>
            <li>You just start out with light layers and continue layering until you get the shade you want.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t Look Orange ( Looked More Like A Golden Tan But Not Orange )</li>
            <li>I am a light olive skin colour</li>
            <li>Some brown colour can be seen in the water that rinses off in the shower but you are still left with a great colour.</li>
            <li>Once out of the shower I toweled off thoroughly and put moisturizer on my face, hands, lightly on my knees, elbows, and feet.</li>
            <li>and I find it extremely important that it looks &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The color guard is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you have light skin and you want a glow, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>It goes on very evenly, it smells nice, and it doesn&#x27;t look orange.</li>
            <li>It smells tropical and goes on streak free.</li>
            <li>There is SOME light streaking as it does take time to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>6- spray onto glove and lightly apply to face.&lt;br /&gt;step</li>
            <li>looks great the next day</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless is by far the best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my skin sticky, and I can see instant results!</li>
            <li>If it was available in a spray mist it would be easier to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>all of the bronzer washed off and left me with a great looking</li>
            <li>Couple light smudges around my toe</li>
            <li>AND it has enough color to be a great guide for where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent going on, but I did get that gross after scent.  </li>
            <li>I am light skinned.</li>
            <li>The mitt helps the product go on smoothly and evenly without staining your hands.  </li>
            <li>I got this product a few weeks ago and it works great!</li>
            <li>It fades nicely like a real tan.</li>
            <li>Great tanning product, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>It works for some,and doesn&#x60;t for others.&lt;br /&gt;The success of using depends on so many factors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>try it when you have the time, and when you do not have any important appearances;&lt;br /&gt;-try</li>
            <li>a day before and do not use creams or body lotions before( except a light layer on palms,knees,elbows;&lt;br /&gt;-DON&#x60;T USE THE GIVEN MITT, purchase a separate one from Beautisol</li>
            <li>or just use apricot scrub on the cheap.</li>
            <li>but that is important</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliation and barrier creams are important.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth.</li>
            <li>Apply a light moisturizer to elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mit is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It will wash away after you wash your hands or take a shower, but your tan will still be there lightly.</li>
            <li>wish it  had a  more golden golw.</li>
            <li>Great for instant color.</li>
            <li>The smell is very tropical and smells like coconut rum to be honest in the bottle.</li>
            <li>it helps give a streak free look.</li>
            <li>The price is great especially for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many different self tan products, and this by far is the BEST I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>Color goes on smooth and looks &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The mitt applications makes for the even smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>This product goes on so evenly and smooth, you don&#x27;t have to keep washing your hands in fear of staining them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay upwards of $50 for some of the ones you might find at a cosmetics counter that get fantastic reviews.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast, smells nice.</li>
            <li>but overall it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I use light therapy for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products and haven&#x27;t come across any that have actually been streak free or good smelling.</li>
            <li>Enjoy a tan without worry of skin cancer</li>
            <li>Streak free.</li>
            <li>but what a great and crucial piece to avoid orange spots and hand stains.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;The color is good, natural looking shade not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>and I also loved how you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s far superior to Jergens, et al.</li>
            <li>I can now feel much more confident knowing I&#x27;m not aging my skin in trying to get a real tan.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>love it, make skin soft and give it nice shade of tan.</li>
            <li>Perfect plenty to do whole body several times</li>
            <li>and so far it looks good.</li>
            <li>Flawless mitt helps for a smooth application, although I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much of it is wasted by soaking into the mitt itself.  </li>
            <li>Really it stays on best if you just wash with soap only &amp; no cloth or scrubber.  </li>
            <li>Literally everyone I&#x27;ve seen who has had a gorgeous tan admitted to using Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>and the mitt kept absorbing more and more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair with reddish undertone and I have tried so many different self tanners.</li>
            <li>Being able to see where you put it and having instant gorgeous...</li>
            <li>I took another reviewers advice and wash the mitt out after every use; so far so good.</li>
            <li>With this it looks perfectly natural and makes me look good</li>
            <li>gives a good natural tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fake bake is the best or as good as St Tropez mousse faux tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how good this works.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Before I begin, I am 21 years old and extremely fair.</li>
            <li>It is good for anyone, of any color as far as I am can tell.</li>
            <li>The color is a good natural one.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I am a fair, blond, blue eyed woman with the whitest legs you have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>So being 31 years old, I know that tanning isn&#x27;t good for me...</li>
            <li>This product is really good and leaves your skin naturally tan and for its price</li>
            <li>This product is good enough for me to recommend to my sister, since we both understand the damaging effects of the sun, but desire a believable looking tan.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, no harsh tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li>My natural color is fair to medium.</li>
            <li>I spray the product directly onto my skin (instead of onto the mitt), which I find to be more effective, but it gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>The tan looks really good, and natural.</li>
            <li>It delivered a natural looking glow that I loved it and for once I didn&#x27;t stink like self tanner.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>the color isn&#x27;t orange, but really natural even on lighter or fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>Natural looking, not orange (and I&#x27;m fair skinned).</li>
            <li>I ordered Fake Bake Flawless after a friend of mine recommended it to someone on Facebook after the girl asked if anyone knew where to get a good spray tan that didn&#x27;t turn you orange.</li>
            <li>Bake Flawless is now my favorite product.o knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly, let it sit for at LEAST 6 hours, and use your hands to rinse, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells really good and makes your skin soft after application.</li>
            <li>Although the color is good when you put it on, it seems to wash off almost completely.</li>
            <li>The product was in perfect condition and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>VERY natural looking!!!!!</li>
            <li>So excited I can do quick touch ups and color my legs when I need to!</li>
            <li>Again, with the bronzer it looks like I have a great and natural tan, however if this application does not darken I wonder if it will wash right off tonight when I shower.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pale so this is perfect!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve always had pale skin, but this tanner gives me that perfect bronze glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ghostly pale and this is the perfect medium bronze for me!</li>
            <li>this has a nice natural color, if you have fair skin do  NOT use too often youll be bronze like SNOOOOKIII but other wise</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the mitt and the application; but after the first time I used this and saw how easy it was to apply, I was hopeful.  </li>
            <li>The smell is AMAZING absolutely no icky self tanner smell that sticks with you all day!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants that flawless, fresh tan !</li>
            <li>, interesting right?</li>
            <li>I love that you can see the color right away.</li>
            <li>I got 2 more boxes of this tanning product waiting to be bought in my cart right now,</li>
            <li>All the reviews were right, and I am so glad I took a chance on this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better than it is right now.</li>
            <li>I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied it right &amp;</li>
            <li>i do love how it gives you a tan right away and  gradually builds darker.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;d do anything with water right after your application (like washing your face, brushing your teeth, etc).</li>
            <li>I watched many videos on how to apply it and it work right for me.</li>
            <li>YouTube had great demo on this product so it made it very easy to apply and get a great tan look with only few minutes before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and all of the other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and can not expose myself to sun or tanning beds due to battling melanoma twice.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, I would recommend THIS over the original as its easier to apply &amp;better outcome.its worth a try if you have the $.</li>
            <li>Love this product, doesnt leave streaks, smells great unlike other self tanners</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is better than any other tanning product I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>The color is NOT dark but is also not orange,  a good light bronze color.</li>
            <li>This one has NO bad smell, and it goes on easily with the applicator mitt.</li>
            <li>I do not go to the tanning bed, so this product is exactly what I need!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li>Instant tan, love it!!</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I was pretty steamed!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use it a lot, I recommend exfoliating really well each time you use this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>FEEL PRETTY!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big production to put it on all over evenly, but the results are very nice.</li>
            <li>It comes out a beautiful light brown color that you can build on and it stays a far more natural shade than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice and had my teenage daughter wanting to use it!</li>
            <li>Even if you get extra product in one spot it evens out very nicely after you shower.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon reimbursed me but the product itself is okay if you want a quick tan look</li>
            <li>Dries super quick and lasts on my skin longer than most people said it would.</li>
            <li>It has a great color at first, much better color then others that I&#x27;ve tried, but once I showered the next day all the color was gone.</li>
            <li>The price is incredible, compared to tanning memberships and other tanning</li>
            <li>Ever since then I have searched high and low for the perfect self tanner...</li>
            <li>I am SUPER fair skinned and this product looked completely natural on me!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve got my mother in law &amp; all my girls in love with this stuff , it really is a quick easy way to get quick color , not a nasty orange color either , a nice deep tan .</li>
            <li>You can always build on it either right after ur first application or the next day it still looks great!</li>
            <li>Goes on so easy, smells great, dries fast, and fades natural...</li>
            <li>Easy apply looks much more natural than most.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the spray top because it goes everywhere around in a fine mist, I noticed it on the bathroom floor later, so I just unscrew the top and dap on the mitt and apply in circular motion, works much better for me that way.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I watched youtube videos on how to apply and it was super easy.</li>
            <li>I applied lightly the first time to make sure that it didn&#x27;t appear orange or out of the bottle tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and reading reviews and watching a couple YouTube videos helped tremendously with application.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>

            <li>I can honestly say that using this stuff gives me a decent tan that by no means looks orange.</li>
            <li>Goes on super easy</li>
            <li>The smell is very delightful at first whiff but after being on the skin for more than an hour it starts to have a very odd and displeasing smell.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The guide makes it easy to get the tan even, and it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>Plus if it does stain, it also washes out super easily.</li>
            <li>If you exfoliate first as the instructions say-it really looks good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super easy to blend</li>
            <li>Also easy to quickly build a gradual tan.</li>
            <li>They made it super easy.</li>
            <li>Even though it is super easy to use it takes a couple of trials before you get the correct tone.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>

            <li>love the mitt and smell is great compared to other self tanners!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to apply than say a lotion and it will end up on your light-colored clothing, but it washes out and it really does give you a rich, brown tan for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>Found my new favorite sunless tanner!</li>
            <li>This is now my new favorite!</li>
            <li>live in Texas and most know that with the sun here, I should be able to tan without problem.</li>
            <li>I like to use it in the morning because the color guard gives you an awesome, dark tan right away</li>
            <li>Also, this seller shipped it super fast which is always nice.</li>
            <li>It works great for a quick and simple tan!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and it really was easy to apply, and I didnt get all of that yucky orange streaking on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>It was easy, it smells good when you put it on, I wore the gloves, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t when he did my back</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply, never looks orange, never streaks and always looks natural --- and I am a spaz with this kind of stuff.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very well and is nice for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, natural looking color, nice smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the mitten, however you must take your time and really make sure you apply it correctly and stay away from water, sweat, or the rain.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and gives a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>so I have to put a crappy towel down to prevent it getting on my floors or spray my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good.</li>
            <li>Wow, I just used this for the first time and love it!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product - it smells great and goes on looking very natural.</li>
            <li>Used to use fake bake mousse and loved it, but this is even better because the tan really lasts --  Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you exfoliate very well!</li>
            <li>But so worth it!  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t apply for me as well as the cream original formula.</li>
            <li>I think this product was worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also significantly easier than lotion to rub into the skin without streaks.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I rinse my mitt with hot water immediately after using</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m golden yaaay!</li>
            <li>I had to stop when I became more aware of the consequences of sun overexposure.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>When I got this in the mail I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>And I just poked a small hole in the seal to stick the tube of the spray nozzle into and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>rolled around that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it for me...however!  </li>
            <li>, I burn, so I was excited to try this</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless is my all time favorite self tanner!</li>
            <li>and after just one use of this i am golden , glowing and not orange !</li>
            <li>I love this,but after my first apply,  found out Im allergic to it.</li>
            <li>She was really excited about the results</li>
            <li>oh, I was so excited to use,</li>
            <li>Ive got my 3rd bottle still loving it!</li>
            <li>Not orange, no streaks , no weird smell, and love the applying mit.</li>
            <li>Just as good as a spray tan actually much much better, looks more natural, cheaper, lasts just as long&amp; my favorite -that one ingredient that all tanning products have</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product after reading all of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product and try it out.</li>
            <li>I was so excited,</li>
            <li>The product came and i was sooo excited to use it</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>all tan wipes I&#x27;m used to using but def worth the time!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this in the past,and I can &#x27;t believe Amazon can offer this product for almost 1/2 the price I originally paid.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the color &amp; application the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine any of the higher priced sunless tanning lotions doing any better.</li>
            <li>in fact I bought the original and the darker version because I couldn&#x27;t decide.</li>
            <li>the original took about 2-3ish coats.</li>
            <li>No horrible smell, funny orange color or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to found this</li>
            <li>It has great staying power, but not as long as some of the pricier ones</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time this week and love it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li>When the correct measures are taken, it looks great for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product is worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>and I was definately not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I discovered this product.</li>
            <li>I feel HOT with the color it gives me :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past alone with out a spray tan underneath and it truly is &#x27;flawless&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>that user friendly.  </li>
            <li>was originally going to give 2*</li>
            <li>Fast shipping! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it blends over rough spots like knees and elbows beautifully.</li>
            <li>No matter how well a tanner goes on, how great the color is, or how long it lasts, I won&#x27;t use it if it has that tell-tale self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li>Get it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lotions in the past and just put them on with my gloved hands, but it was never as, well, flawless as this.</li>
            <li>14 hours later, I have a bra and tank top on and there are still no lines :) :).</li>
            <li>I decided that after I originally got it all over the bathroom room, that maybe I would try it again in the shower (easier to cleanup).  </li>
            <li>I will stick to the original from now on.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you shave first and exfoliate....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t originally buy this thinking</li>
            <li>I originally bought two 12 oz bottles, (</li>
            <li>And then you are golden!</li>
            <li>i was pretty pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>I use to go tanning before I had my 5 children but since having them I have not had the time to get to a tanning facility and when I did find time to go to the beach I barely got a good tan</li>
            <li>The product works best if you put small amounts on at a time to build up to your tan.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this was better</li>
            <li>I got dressed and went to bed, all excited to wake up looking like J.Lo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, this product is worth a shot!</li>
            <li>remember to exfoliate before ( better 24hs before first use).</li>
            <li>think that the comments saying it looked like dirt or that it washed away after the first shower can safely be ignored.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate before first use, that may be why some people were having problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a really nice smell and not a hint of normal tanner smell.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited abut my purchase.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the purchase and will be purchasing  again soon!</li>
            <li>and I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>with any product it can have short comings and it takes time to learn how to use/apply successfully and adjust the practice to your liking.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most logical manner in which to acquire a tan... models do it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but in the past this company has delivered perfectly</li>
            <li>I used it first and just fell in love</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had such nice glowing, bronzed skin like I do now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>And it was worth it!</li>
            <li>will be adding a picture to show exactly how awesome the final product of the lotion was for me on the first go, and</li>
            <li>Just exfoliate and moisturize before applying and your golden bronze!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll buy this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was wanting and I will def be buying more.</li>
            <li>No more \\&quot;orange\\&quot; knees and elbows and the fragrance is great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a self-tanner before, but this has to be the easiest, most fool-proof product to use, and it works fast!  </li>
            <li>A TAD MORE AFTER FIRST LAYER</li>
            <li>A LIGHT SWEET SMELL,&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you get such a nice bronze color!</li>
            <li>I wake up with a consistently even, believable tan every time.</li>
            <li>I am super translucent pale and just one coating is perfect for me</li>
            <li>This is very easy to apply, the color is a very natural golden color, so you won&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa, and there is no horrible after smell.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice golden brown, even coverage and super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>The formula dries very quickly, yet allows you just the right amount of time to smooth it on evenly.</li>
            <li>It creates a beautiful, realistic warm, brown looking tan, is easy to apply, and what little of the color that rubbed off on my linen sheets washed out.</li>
            <li>drawback to this product is that you feel bronze and gorgeous right away, but some of it rinses off in the shower because most of the color you get instantly is from the color guide.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  </li>
            <li>Easy, great color, quick dry!</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as other tanners.</li>
            <li>Great smell and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>it goes on so dry and smells great</li>
            <li>The color is the most natural and the mitt helps you get the most even application you can ask for from a self tanner.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair to medium skin tone with blue eyes and light brown hair</li>
            <li>After trying several brands, this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>and then I had to just clean the sink up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>By far the most convincing tanning product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I just want everyone to be as happy and relieved to finally find something worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>I was able to do it myself and it really is streak free.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, great natural color and even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice when you apply it but still has that self tanner smell the next day which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, just don&#x27;t own white sheets</li>
            <li>The coverage is nice and the color is natural looking on my light skin.</li>
            <li>I could tell my freshly shaven and exfoliated legs absorbed the product better.</li>
            <li>tan lasts me about 5 to 6 days and even when it starts to fade, it fades &#x27;cleanly&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The mitt helps to keep my hands clean.</li>
            <li>and it sure beats wrinkles and rashes caused by the sun, not to mention the dangers of skin cancer - even to the young and seemingly invincible:)</li>
            <li>It leaves such a natural looking tan and the mitt makes it a breeze to apply flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I recommend having a bit of time to apply it, you really want to smooth it on evernly and make sure to get every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and though I can tan lightly on my face, arms, and back, but not my legs!  </li>
            <li>My sister has more pink undertones to her skin and it turned her bright orange.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh as well, it never stinks like most sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be healthy and tanned at the same time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for a quick touch of color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it in circular motion however its very forgiving and the coverage is so smooth and flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the kit comes with a pouch that&#x27;s actually the applicator you use to put on the tanner, no messy hands, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>And yes, rinse the mitt after use to keep it clean and in shape.</li>
            <li>Big YES from me, i would recommend to anyone looking for a nice healthy tan without the damage of a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Keep mit clean.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve used this 3 times, and love love the way I look...</li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin, dries quickly</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing dresses to work and this has helped my pasty legs tremendously.</li>
            <li>I find this to be the most natural color for my pasty skin, and also the most affordable.</li>
            <li>I think it would be nice if the mitt was more like an actual mitten or something</li>
            <li>I am blonde, light eyes, fair with freckles.</li>
            <li>I always apply at night before bed onto clean skin.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that this is by far the very best self tanning product I have ever used, and I have used ALOT of different products!</li>
            <li>so I avoid tanning beds and excessive sun exposure but a beautiful tan looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>Because you don&#x27;t want to wash off all the tanning lotion that you put on your hands, and then try and clean the glove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the next best thing to my professional spay sessions.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly with the glove, and the color developes quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I do clean and shave my mit.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth, no streaking.</li>
            <li>I read almost every review and discovered that all the negative reviews said &amp;#34;I have fair skin.&amp;#34; Well I don&#x27;t have fair skin.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell compared to tanners that actually tan.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant until the next morning and you can still smell the sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li>Has pleasant smell similar to Tropicana suntan lotion that has that tropical, &amp;#34;coconutty-type&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly fixable though, just put more around the inside of your knees/elbows and then wet a paper towel or some TP and wipe off the tanner from any still tan parts</li>
            <li>But the soft pad and light misty tan spray made the operation quite smooth and very easy.</li>
            <li>It gave me a beautiful, deep, rich tan that so far has lasted better than a week.  </li>
            <li>Just perfectly warm and olive, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>And the mitt applicator was very soft, but I don&#x27;t know how effective it was if I noticed splotchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It smells good but not strong, isn&#x27;t streaky, and produces a beautiful, natural tan color--no orange!  </li>
            <li>This seemed to have the most amount of positive feedback.</li>
            <li>On a more positive note, I do like the color.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get so many positive reviews??</li>
            <li>Im very pale skinned and stopped using tanning beds because they destroyed my skin and this is a great product for people like me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply/spray amd spread and looks very natural!</li>
            <li>The result was streak free and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing at first but changes after a few hours to a smell that it not so great.</li>
            <li>By far the best sunless tanner I have tried thus far in my 20 years of being an avid tanner.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and the tan it gives is so natural looking, no lines or orange color!</li>
            <li>As long as you wear the gloves and apply with the mitt, this goes on nicely and gives a great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>This one does smell the best of ones I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s kind of a chocolatey scent rather than full on fake tan smell.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this throughout the summer to maintain a beautiful tan, without the damage from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: One bottle of this has lasted me 6 applications so far, and I have probably 3/4 more left.</li>
            <li>Once it is washed off you will have a nice natural bronze that doesn&#x27;t look orange!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of sunless tanners and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Without a tan my skin is pretty fair, kinda blotchy red for the most part</li>
            <li>And it looks natural and sexy!</li>
            <li>And this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Used according to directions along with other reviews/instructions and turns out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and wow I love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you read her entire review, as she has some pretty good advice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried an array of self tanners including Xen Tan as well as all of the drug store brands and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Nice, natural glow though!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned (one step up from a red head, basically) and this works pretty well, better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>Very light, not greasy, dries fast and keeps hands clean.</li>
            <li>I put it on last night and when i applied you can easily tell where it&#x27;s been applied so its real easy to keep track.</li>
            <li>The color is an amazing golden brown and the mit makes it completely streak free and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good self tanning product, and the best thing about it in my opinion is that is doesn&#x27;t have/cause that unpleasant smell that most self manners do...</li>
            <li>I tan well, but I have very fair skin, blue eyes, and I am older, over 50 yrs.  </li>
            <li>I do not think i will be ordering this again unless it turns out to be the absolute best tanning product after I try other tanning products.</li>
            <li>just make sure u put a towel on the floor when u apply it other wise</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll most certainly need the face tanner for your face.  </li>
            <li>You can tell this is a better product right from the start as it has a brown color vs orange right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>(I will mix in a sunscreen if needed), is non-comedogenic, and rather than using it instead of my special acne controlling moisturizer, I can mix it in.  </li>
            <li>But it holds up well if you&#x27;re doing it for special weekend.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t, then I will save this stuff for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands so this might not be a problem to most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not even use an special exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I would just spend the money to get an air brush tan for special events, etc.  </li>
            <li>the reviews were right!</li>
            <li>Works well if you use it right!</li>
            <li>, you can see difference right away!</li>
            <li>I was amazed to see the results right away!</li>
            <li>this product but biggest tips are exfoliate, do right after you take a shower, and apply in the shower!</li>
            <li>so you can see right away!</li>
            <li>my neighbor at work noticed my tan and asked ...and she ordered it right away !</li>
            <li>figured out right!</li>
            <li>but it rinsed right out!</li>
            <li>Throw away all your self-tanners and purchase this one right now!</li>
            <li>When you reorder (and you will if you love it like I do) you will get a brand new mitt!!</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and leaves even the palest person(me) with a even golden tan.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt it keeps my hands clean and allows you to really rub it in and even it out.</li>
            <li>Messy , but very good product 😊</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and does not give a gross orange look that most self tanners do.</li>
            <li>Looks great and dries really fast (within seconds) which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>Best color, dries instantly, hardly ever rubs off onto clothing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super excited to see how it turns out.</li>
            <li>The most realistic face tan money can buy!</li>
            <li>It has a malibu rum coconuty mild smell and about the time to wash it off about 6 hours there is a very light self tanner smell which you really have to smell for.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply and you can dress right after.</li>
            <li>And the seller I bought from was such a great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty great product &amp; I&#x27;ll be using this for a while.</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty great product.</li>
            <li>I think the scent is pretty good as far as self tanners go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars searching for that all around great self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>, I still hadn&#x27;t washed it, but it came out looking as great as the first time, but the third time I used it without washing it!!!</li>
            <li>More importantly, have to wait hours after air brush tanning to resume normal activities vs 1 hour or just sleep overnight.</li>
            <li>The color is not a orange like most self tanners, it&#x27;s more of a natural golden brown.</li>
            <li>I has a great smell, but no matter how much i put on, I barely got any color.</li>
            <li>first try gave me a believable golden tan.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely fair, to the point where even the lightest shade of foundation in most makeup is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good not a heavy odor at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff, fool proof and EXTREMELY NATURAL LOOKING.  </li>
            <li>The mitt makes application very simple and it has a great smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>No bad smell, nice natural brownish color.</li>
            <li>All in all so far so amazing.</li>
            <li>It works better than others costing two and three times more (yes, even St. Tropez, Bare Minerals and Tarte).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really not that great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really not that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can use whatever kind works for you, just as long as you moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced this as well and to solve it, I just spread my fingers out really wide to keep the mitt in place.</li>
            <li>Lots of people said they got 10 plus full body tans with this product with spraying it on their body and not on the mitt.</li>
            <li>about 10 minutes looked good went outside to do some gardening</li>
            <li>Just nice natural looking tan tint to my skin.</li>
            <li>I got a nice even natural tan.</li>
            <li>and it was true.</li>
            <li>no streaking , no awful smell and real looking color</li>
            <li>I also love the way this one fades off very evenly to, which has been a problem with others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am now a light golden tan.</li>
            <li>This is the best, easiest, most real looking tan in a bottle....just fades after a shower but the longer you leave it on, at least 8 hours, the darker it will be.</li>
            <li>It takes me five minutes to apply this to my whole body using the buffing mitt and it is streak free!</li>
            <li>It really is so much better than spending so much time in tanning beds and risking skin cancer.</li>
            <li>The only good note I have about the color is that there were no streaks, and it was even.   </li>
            <li>To be fair, I tried this stuff 4-5 times and always got the same, not-so-great results.</li>
            <li>Everything it claims is true EXCEPT it is transferable.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and already have two of my friends hooked on it with</li>
            <li>It is true, as others have said, that when you shower after application (I apply before bed and shower in the morning)</li>
            <li>The color guide is very helpful in seeing (for the most part) where you have applied it.</li>
            <li>This product smells so good that I actually get complimented on what scent I&#x27;m wearing, as if I&#x27;m wearing perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot , and thos one is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>so I wear full sunblock and use this instead to look like I have some \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product gives a nice, natural color tan.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this product is how fast that it dries on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like that formula for those looking for a bit more color.</li>
            <li>I love the built in bronzer that lets you see where you&#x27;ve applied the product, very helpful for application.</li>
            <li>Good customer service, I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I have been paying full price for this when I could have gotten it here all along.</li>
            <li>For sure use the gloves under the mitt because it dries fast</li>
            <li>It went on so well and looked so good, then I took a shower the next morning</li>
            <li>Overall good, just not quite for me</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for those that prefer to have that sun kissed look without damaging their skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice with the glove and gives you a natural glow.  </li>
            <li>I wore the rubber gloves, did not use the mit, put a good amount of lotion on the glove, 4 sprays of the colorant, mixed it up in my hands and then applied to my legs.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, even, natural color.</li>
            <li>Like many people, I want results fast.</li>
            <li>version by FakeBake because I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a vain person, but all I want is to hide the cracks and scales; not look like a walking sweet potato.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much .</li>
            <li>and I love the way it gradually just gets lighter before you are ready to do again.</li>
            <li>Looks good but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>But overall good product...</li>
            <li>This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li>and I decided to try it since she provided such a good review.</li>
            <li>I love the color-my husband still thinks it was a real tan...</li>
            <li>I tried this after seeing several good reviews and thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that there is no streaking or lines with this product.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 6 days to build up to the color I wanted which was a light golden brown.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>:) I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>There is no ugly smell, just a coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>It produces a nice natural color and does not smell overly offensive.  </li>
            <li>In summary, it&#x27;s better than spending too much time in the sun or tanning bed.</li>
            <li>OK I literally have way too much to say about this stuff but</li>
            <li>True to word,</li>
            <li>This product works as well as the spray tans, honestly, and it looks like natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is also true.</li>
            <li>It looks like a healthy brown, not orange, and the glove makes everything so much easier.</li>
            <li>It give you a nice natural, even color.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>I got between 8-10 full body uses.  </li>
            <li>The color looks so real, doesn&#x27;t rub off on ANYTHING, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this product, looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Products like these are only as good as their users.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this item is that it does give you color</li>
            <li>COOL</li>
            <li>Loved it but kinda left my legs</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li>A full bottle lasts for about 18-20 full body applications, i would say.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a shimmer (you really can&#x27;t see any difference), however it does help darken the tan from the Flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This bottle will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, you def get that instant bronze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is still some color left by Thursday which is good.  </li>
            <li>I really really like the color of the tan that I am able to get with this product.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it look good</li>
            <li>but once you sleep on it and shower the next morning, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>This product is very flexible and we love it.</li>
            <li>Tried it a couple times to be sure, but I&#x27;m very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>and I applied 3 coats, one after another and just loved that my body looked like I just came back from a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li>Many others leave me patchy or scaly, but this just gradually fades like a real tan.  </li>
            <li>I should add that I am a strawberry blonde with fair to medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>IT DRIES SO FAST :)</li>
            <li>, especially for us fair skinned folks.  </li>
            <li>You must know what your doing and have good technique to properly apply.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good self tanner, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li>This will help the mitt from absorbing a lot of product (another downside to lotions) and it will go on more evenly.</li>
            <li>and you do have to wait a full 8 hours</li>
            <li>I am really pale---and I love this product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job in the cover up the white skin patches caused by vitilago.  </li>
            <li>Will need to buy something with more intense color.</li>
            <li>Also, the mitten that comes with it works very well, but make sure you have a rubber glove on your hand under the mitten as the liquid absorbs into the glove well and WILL turn your palms orange.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well and lasts for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li>I do love that it dries so fast  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much, I&#x27;ve never been streaky or orange and you know that&#x27;s the biggest no nos for self tanner.</li>
            <li>Going this route is much cheaper than getting spray on tans and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you really, really, exfoliate when using this.</li>
            <li>And make sure you get under your arms really well.</li>
            <li>so at this rate, the bottle will last a good while.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color, driest fast, you can see what it is that your putting on.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Work your way up from your ankles to your knees, make sure you are working the whole way around your calves and then thighs.</li>
            <li>* Invest in a good wand that can be used to reach your back if you aren&#x27;t yoga flexible.</li>
            <li>* Invest in a good wand that can be used to reach your back if you aren&#x27;t yoga flexible.</li>
            <li>But since I love the color so much, 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;7&#x27;&#x27;ish and a full 185 pounds.  </li>
            <li>BUT let me just warn you, that I packed a full bottle into my luggage when going on vacay, In a sealed ziplock bag to prevent spilling, and when I got to the hotel</li>
            <li>I now order two bottles at once I love it sooo much.</li>
            <li>but it also goes on with a red tone which is quite surprising.</li>
            <li>you get color almost immediately &amp; full color in about 6 hours .</li>
            <li>The color comes out evenly and natural lookig, and after one application when I wake up the next day, I feel so much more attractive.</li>
            <li>At first it looked kind of strange but after using the mitt to rub around, it came out nice.</li>
            <li>Love the immediate result, but fades fast.</li>
            <li>, that is sort of true.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve found that it comes in full force when I go to the gym.</li>
            <li>By the time I am done with my full body application, I can immediately put on my pajamas and not worry about it making my tan streaky.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad...</li>
            <li>This product is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>So far this seems like a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as air brush, but at 1/4 the cost not a bad deal and can be used for multiple applications.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>It is not bad at all...</li>
            <li>think the price is not bad at all for this</li>
            <li>Not bad stuff.</li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price too.  </li>
            <li>You can get the St. Tropez self-tanning pump bottle for a little bit more, and it will give you way better, more easily obtainable results.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, hands down the best sunless tanner on the market.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best tanning product hands down.</li>
            <li>The most darkest natural looking tan you can buy!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or streaky, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, looks very real.</li>
            <li>Very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful, and make sure you rub it in good right away.</li>
            <li>This might be my favorite find yet though; the mit makes for a SUPER fast application (just did a full body app in under 5min) and the toner helps to guide the way so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>It really is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t streak (which is amazing) and it last for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>and I read so many reviews on it and can now add to those and say how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural looking.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is easy to apply and the color looks natural.</li>
            <li>So it does go on really well, love the mitt it help tremendously.</li>
            <li>I love the natural look and easy application...</li>
            <li>This product looks natural, and it is easy to do application, unlike most products that make your skin look orange.</li>
            <li>If I use this item and then go on a run I drip tanning spray but other than that its great for those special events where you don&#x27;t have time to get to the tanning bed for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>Best self tanner I have tried in the past 4 years!</li>
            <li>This tanning product is super quick to apply and when you first put it on it smells very tropical like a coconut kind of scent.</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes for a very nice deep tan (no orange) if you are willing to devote the time.</li>
            <li>If you just rub it on with the mitt that they give you, it is fantastic and blends right</li>
            <li>It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes.</li>
            <li>It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buildable so it doesn&#x27;t show up too strong the first time</li>
            <li>is pretty easy to keep from looking streaky, and isn&#x27;t too orange looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This particular fake bake in my opinion, is best for fair skin.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how easy it was to apply and the bronzer makes the tan look incredibly dark and easy to tell where you have not applied.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, and the color guide shows you exactly where the product is so you can avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, you can see exactly where you are applying the product.</li>
            <li>A lovely natural looking tan, stays on nicely, super easy application.</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this for those that have very light skin tones.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, looks like a great tan and no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, DOESN&#x27;T SMELL, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, dries quickly, and most important the tan is very long lasting and looks REAL.</li>
            <li>Works really well, very easy to get an even real looking tan!</li>
            <li>Price is great compared to other products.</li>
            <li>It looks GREAT compared to all other self-tanners.</li>
            <li>I have been soaking the mitten in hot water, but it&#x27;s probably more effective to actually wash it with soap (but I haven&#x27;t tried, too</li>
            <li>I also experienced the bottle leaking like some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it arrived 6 days before expected!</li>
            <li>I followed the advice of other purchasers and cut the stem of the spray bottle, which has prevented it from leaking as others experienced.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>So other than the scent, this is a great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li>other then that its a great product.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers on Amazon have given great recommendations on how to use this product and I recommend you read those too.</li>
            <li>Two other things I&#x27;m not \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; about; the smell SOMETIMES even after showering and it doesn&#x27;t look that great on my face.</li>
            <li>Other sunless tanning lotions I used would leave streaks, give an orange appearance or just not work that great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair skinned redhead and I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunless tanning products including professional airbrush tans and automated spray tan booths.</li>
            <li>Also if you miss a spot or put too much on you can just spray more on or rub in the excess to blend it, making it look natural and making it easy to fix mistakes!  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate and apply at night, and then rinse off in the morning, and I am left with a beautiful, natural looking tan!!  </li>
            <li>I tan very easily but need a little help in the spring and on my legs in general, no weird orange/yellow color, just beautiful brown!</li>
            <li>This is seriously THE best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful product for people with SLE who can&#x27;t tan in the sun at all, and for anyone else who takes seriously the damage that the sun can do to their skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best self tanning product I have ever tried and SO inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I did everything exactly as instructed, and the application was just fine...</li>
            <li>The first arm I did looked fine.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best out there.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This works great, easy to put on and looks so natural, has such a mild smell, doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves an even tan, dries quickly, and the mit prevents streaks.</li>
            <li>Repeat till all is covered  - Move quickly</li>
            <li>ABSOULUTLEY LOVE FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li>Ordered this stuff then realized this stuff is super</li>
            <li>The bronzer will wash off in the shower the next morning, but you still have a great color that looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li>I began just trying any and every self-tanner that I could get my hands on, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with anything until I tried Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky nor did it stain my clothes afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I was applying it quickly.</li>
            <li>Got shipped to me quickly</li>
            <li>Over the years I have use many many different brands of self tanners on the quest not to look orange or have the product sink into my pores after shaving my legs!  </li>
            <li>I will continue to seek out ways to keep this from fading so quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly then I&#x27;m off to bed.</li>
            <li>Luckily I sprayed it into my sink</li>
            <li>The downside is the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The mit makes application incredibly fast and smooth, streak free.</li>
            <li>It dries super quick with no sticky feel.  </li>
            <li>so this gives me quick color.</li>
            <li>The mitt makes it glide on evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>If I were more diligent and used it more, I think the results would last longer.</li>
            <li>Then I blend in quickly in circular motion.  </li>
            <li>I am completely in love with Fake Bake Flawless self-tanner.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Fake Bake Flawless gives me better color than a spray tan in a salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant, so people have been telling me that \\&quot;I&#x27;m glowing\\&quot;, but</li>
            <li>also really enjoyed this particular seller,</li>
            <li>I like the spray as opposed to lotion because of the quick drying time.</li>
            <li>I have always been scared to ever even try spray tanner, but now I am pregnant</li>
            <li>Washed off quickly too.</li>
            <li>The tanner dries quick</li>
            <li>It has a mild tropical scent that I like.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li>Another super</li>
            <li>This will stain clothing but if you need a quick tan this does the job.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>(Having years of experience in the beauty field, I know facial products work best for the face because our pores are smaller on the face than the body, so this makes sense to me.)</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>(Having years of experience in the beauty field, I know facial products work best for the face because our pores are smaller on the face than the body, so this makes sense to me.)</li>
            <li>It always arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>and this bottle is going quickly.</li>
            <li>I love fake bake Flawless!</li>

            <li>I do like this fake bake flawless, I do! :)</li>
            <li>- I really love this Fake Bake product best of all.  </li>
            <li>It goes on evenly, dries quickly, and one bottle lasts me quite awhile.</li>
            <li>It dries super quick.  </li>
            <li>I was in a friend&#x27;s wedding when I was 7 months pregnant and needed some color for the one-strap dresses.  </li>
            <li>think 60 min gives a more realistic tan</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and never looks streaky.</li>
            <li>I love Fake Bake products and this may be the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>I am super satisfied with Fake Bake Flawless...</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>Most reviewers of the face formula say that this regular body formula works much better on the face, so I&#x27;m going to stick with this one and eventually muster up the courage to try it</li>
            <li>Love the Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li>Love Fake Bake...goes on perfect every time.</li>
            <li>But you apply the product and within about an hour you sart to see the results, take a shower about 4-6hoirs later to wash off the the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re left with a great color!</li>
            <li>This is a super product.  </li>
            <li>A couple things to note: when you are applying the product make sure to spray it evenly on the mitt, and apply in circles at a decent rate of speed to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li>If you wipe it up quickly you may avoid staining said surfaces.</li>
            <li>This product is super liquidy (is that a word?</li>
            <li>you have to go quick</li>
            <li>The formula is great--immediate color develops, dries quickly</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>I have a very yellow skin tone and like most people, most self tanners are just way too orange/red for me.</li>
            <li>If you are quick you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking.</li>
            <li>Fairly Quick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fades Quickly (Gone in about 3-4 showers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I put it on my knees and feet sparingly, but there are no streaks at all, and it dries so quickly, it blows my mind.</li>
            <li>I found the best way to achieve a smoother result was to exfoliate several days prior and moisturize the morning before an evening application.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a super novice self tanner</li>
            <li>covers evenly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the spray tan product Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice, natural golden tan color (I&#x27;m medium complexion) and the scent is not offensive at all....</li>
            <li>of now, this Fake Bake Flawless is my favorite self-tan product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly after you apply it so you don&#x27;t have to stand around nekkid forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now spray on my skin and quickly rub in.</li>
            <li>Drys quick.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to get some colour, I have wry fair skin and use this year round.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller they were quick to reply and my product was delivered within days.</li>
            <li>but i tried many more times and it was the same result.</li>
            <li>I use this as a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>rub off on clothing or sheets, dries extremely quickly and goes on smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many kinds of self-tanning lotions and most will give me skin irritation after several applications.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is super blendable.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted a quick fix to last me until I can physically go outside and lay out, and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell, it dries super quickly</li>
            <li>application process was so quick</li>
            <li>I just use it on my face to hide mild Rosacea every 3 days</li>
            <li>I am overall pleased with the product, but I did expect it to be better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li>I know that with many spray tans they tend to hide these imperfections or even freckles more than your tanning bed or outside tanning experience.</li>
            <li>Once you spray it on though, be quick to rub it in.</li>
            <li>Goes on great, I dont get streaks or look orange, but nothing lasts like a real tan of course, but this is close enough.</li>
            <li>Fake bake flawless is free of parabens!</li>
            <li>The smell is much better than most self-tanners, but it does become obnoxious after several hours.</li>
            <li>I applied it all over my body and was super tender from trying to rub streaks away.</li>
            <li>it spreads quickly using the mitt</li>
            <li>I use this when I am in a super rush and need to get some quick color.</li>
            <li>like how the guide color makes it look like you just got home from Cabo, and it dries super quick unlike the creams.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It was a mild change, but I didn&#x27;t want to do anything drastic in one day.</li>
            <li>Ihave also used the fake bake lotion, gel, and airbrush spray; but the flawless is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I just spritz it on an area and rub in quickly with gloves on.</li>
            <li>I love a healthy glow in the summer, especially on my legs when I wear dresses and shorts.  </li>
            <li>I have tested SO MANY different tanners and thus is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>Luckily with this product I don&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s still one of the best self tanners I&#x27;ve ever tried, especially for this price ($12.94 when I bought it).</li>
            <li>was super informative</li>
            <li>The mitt wore off extremely quickly, but you have to use it to apply because if you just try to use your hands with the gloves the solution won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li>Just ordered fake bake flawless, we&#x27;ll see if that one has better staying power</li>
            <li>Use it twice a week doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes and dries quick.</li>
            <li>but mostly i turned red and more freckled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not orange when applied, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Is even easier to apply, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Alot of fun, and look good at the same time!</li>
            <li>I really love the Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>The color fades off me quite quickly, id say within 2 or 3 days</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind that it fades quick.</li>
            <li>This helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>luckily all came up.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply more and build to an actual tan color.  </li>
            <li>No smell, dries quick.</li>
            <li>It was quick to apply, I&#x27;m not orange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I&#x27;m tan for 5 days.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got immediate color, however it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day or two at most.</li>
            <li>I did want to comment that the seller was super quick in placing the order in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I liked how it was pretty easy to use, just wish the glove fit a little better</li>
            <li>I bought this product previously and love it, came back for more; I would highly recommend it, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>mitt washes out very easily, and the smell reminds me of the old Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion from my wreckless tanning days.</li>
            <li>The mitt washes out very easily, and the smell reminds me of the old Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion from my wreckless tanning days.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>My Husband mentioned I have come along way with trying out Self Tanners and this was is so far the best as far as natural look and no gaudy smell!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this has some major pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless makes me look just as good and natural!</li>
            <li>It helps prevent streaking and it lets you cover huge areas very fast.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, it&#x27;s the second time in my life I use a tanner in spray, the first experience wasn&#x27;t good (another brand), I finished with a carrot color that wasn&#x27;t natural at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and the scent is lovely and inoffensive.</li>
            <li>good for people with more pale skin</li>
            <li>It does have more of a tanner smell to it, but I still highly recommend this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a consumer of MANY self tanning products, I can HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have applied this three times now, and I do enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, quick dry and a beautiful natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It dries immediately which I love because I can put on my pajamas right after &amp; go straight to bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that it runs off on clothing but even it does, it washes right out!</li>
            <li>Color goes on super smooth, no streaks, no fake color.  </li>
            <li>This product seems great at first application - but 80% of the tan washes off in the shower even after waiting hours to let it dry and soak in.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product from the same person each time and have had great success .It is easy to use and provides a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Great product except the mitten starts to wear down quickly</li>
            <li>After reading many positive reviews on Amazon and watching many positive reviews on YouTube, I decided to give Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li>this is great if you are looking for a subtle amount of color that can be applied easily without a huge time commitment.  </li>
            <li>The glove is also a great application tool, I was skeptical at first, but trust me, its amazing!</li>
            <li>Wish the mit would be more durable, after a few uses it doesn&#x27;t apply the product very well but the tanner itself works great.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it staining clothes except in VERY hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it gives you instant color which is great if your skin has not seen any sun since last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy  and love the mitt I just wish it was double sided.</li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin</li>
            <li>I will say however, the color is very pretty...</li>
            <li>It worked better for me than any other kind.</li>
            <li>The original gives a nice tan, I am going to be in a wedding which is the only reason I want to be darker.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and very realistic looking.  </li>
            <li>Goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil in the spray keeps you from getting any streaks or blotches, the price is a steal, and the tan looks so natural that a family member of mine who exclusively tans at salons will be switching after seeing how just 2 applications has given me a nice, healthy, natural-looking tan with nearly zero-effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put it on lightly the first time to get the feel of how it will look.</li>
            <li>Also, When you first put it on (after shaving and exfoliating) wait about 4-6 hours and take a light shower.</li>
            <li>Great, dark color.</li>
            <li>This is the very first tanner that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>The only downfall to an otherwise great tanner is that it doesn&#x27;t really last more than a day.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and looks very realistic.</li>
            <li>First product i have found that is orange and streak FREE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other self tanners before and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>The box is very pretty to me</li>
            <li>Which was my mistake the very first time I applied</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Hope others enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I really had no where to even start, but after viewing a YouTube video about how great Fake Bake was, I decided that for the great price and \\&quot;said</li>
            <li>Great for getting some color, but I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t get as dark as I would like.</li>
            <li>and I have a very consistent tan, which doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>My normal skin tans ok, and</li>
            <li>I ordered it and the morning it came in, i put it on and was very pleased with the initial smell (kinda coconutty...</li>
            <li>price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake tan is amazing just make sure you rub it in good</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>I have tried self tanners and been to get a professional spray tan done in salons but never found any that I truly loved until purchasing Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>it comes with, and drys super fast!!</li>
            <li>Came quick and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast !!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast!!</li>
            <li>This product goes on easy no dry time and is more of a tea stain color than carrot.</li>
            <li>It darkens super fast, is relatively easy to put on but the sprayer nozzle will sometimes leak</li>
            <li>So when you clean your counters, floor, or anything else don&#x27;t be surprised if it comes up with a reddish brown color. :)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think this product would be good for those who are not as fair and the difference in skin coloration wouldn&#x27;t be so noticeably dramatic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly and had a pleasant coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the mitt really makes this an easy and quick self tanner to use.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was so easy to remove the rest of the color it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>It was a fast and easy fix for quick color when I needed it</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, I did my whole body in under like 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>If used exactly as directed, this is certainly one of the better self tanning products I have attempted.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to put on and dried so fast and gives a beautiful tan.  </li>
            <li>Works great big difference nothing to noticable tho highly recomend this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many self tanners over the years, and Fake Bake is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend reapplication  over the course of a few days, to achieve the perfect color/tone.</li>
            <li>Super easy little pouches to travel with and produce a good color too.  </li>
            <li>cause I have fairly light skin and usually do not tan easy.</li>
            <li>This goes on very easily and also not extremely dark.</li>
            <li>I know it is a good thing to exfoliate your skin before you put this on, but with the other non-sprays, I only exfoliated every month, and I was good to go with each application.</li>
            <li>And I live in the LA area so we have many options!&lt;br</li>
            <li>New favorite.</li>
            <li>My new favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li>I have used them all, no joke, I love trying new self tanners and gradual tanners.</li>
            <li>I live in the NW where most of the year it&#x27;s rainy and gray.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, gives an instant beautiful bronze to your skin and the color left behind (because,yes, a bit washes off in the shower) is beautiful as well.</li>
            <li>It honestly blends in with ALL skin types- from the fairest to the most naturally dark.</li>
            <li>Smells great (not the typical urine smell) &amp; you can apply in the morning.</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  </li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions from a previous review, and this product works great.</li>
            <li>Works great at first then doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li>While most of you might find this appalling, I was really happy about this.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and much faster than having to apply a lotion.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have any odor.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to put on thanks to the guide color.</li>
            <li>This product was so easy to use almost foolproof really.</li>
            <li>And it easily rubs off on the glove when you blend it in, so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting so much product.</li>
            <li>I have to say it was easy to apply and extremely fast drying.</li>
            <li>That would make it top notch, except that it takes longer to buff on (with the provided mitt) than most tanners, and more than half of the color washes off with the first shower.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dries soooo fast.</li>
            <li>and I even found a video of a girl showing how easy it was to use it (a real person, not someone who worked for FB).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>get a hint of color with the color guide which is nice, so you don&#x27;t necessarily have to wait until the full color develops.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate really well before the first application and moisturize between applications.</li>
            <li>The mitt makes it easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smell anything at all (as long as I don&#x27;t try to &#x27;double coat&#x27; without showering in between... not my brightest idea) and it leaves a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty good actually.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is very forgiving as well and blends so easily.</li>
            <li>The whole process is very quick, maybe takes me 15 minutes, including shower.</li>
            <li>Some parts of my body were patchy but overall it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply, fast drying and didn&#x27;t rub off.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful long lasting colors and will be purchasing it for now on.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and is a beautiful bronze, and the results are instant.</li>
            <li>The application is easy, it dries really fast &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the hideous smell afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, dries fast, and smells like coconuts.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I liked that it looks pretty natural.  </li>
            <li>It went on very evenly and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy application</li>
            <li>Micro Mist is easy to spray on and seems to blend really well.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, the gloves and mitt that comes with it, help so much with the application. ....</li>
            <li>When you first use it, it&#x27;s like wow my skin is now a nice tan.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it smells good then the next day you reak of sunless tanner smell even after showering.</li>
            <li>The MIT is easy to use and makes it look very even.</li>
            <li>First, I love the mitt...works very well, wish I could buy separately.</li>
            <li>Although my tan did not turn out quite as dark as I would have liked, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless looks very natural and good for the first 1-2 days.</li>
            <li>I can for sure tell that it is  staining my skin, because I can smell that \\&quot;fake tan smell\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t very strong which is good for everyone&#x27;s nose&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Works great the first 5 times, washes off when you take a shower though, no real lasting effect and the effectiveness of it seemed to go down after using it more and more.</li>
            <li>It gives a very nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>While I am aware that there is a big hype for this product, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that great.</li>
            <li>This is the first self tanner that didn&#x27;t turn me into an Oompa Loompa!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more once mine is all gone!</li>
            <li>This self tanner is about the same price as the spray-on ones in Walmart, but it works SO much better!</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t last for more than one week !</li>
            <li>Looks just like real tan from the sun! !</li>
            <li>I have used alot of self tanners but i never thought in a million years i would find something i love so much NO MORE TANNING beds for this girl i love love</li>
            <li>The most natural self tanner ever!</li>
            <li>really works!!</li>
            <li>I got this product within the same week of ordering, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>After the first application, I had a TAN!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fast drying and smells yummy too!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it tho!!!</li>
            <li>Watch tutorials on youtube if you are nervous for your first try!</li>
            <li>This one has never failed me though!</li>
            <li>No fake tan smell, no streaks, and no orange!</li>
            <li>This seems to be as close as I&#x27;m willing to look and it did not dissapoint!</li>
            <li>First self-tanner that works!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first got it because all the reviews</li>
            <li>It washes off with first shower!  </li>
            <li>I use Tinted Love by Designer Skin, which is a moisturizer with a little bit of self tanner in it, &amp; I absolutely love that stuff as well !</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was aiming for!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Gives you a rich tan even on first go.</li>
            <li>You can see exactly where you are putting it!</li>
            <li>if you have a French manicure, be sure to wear enclosed rubber gloves, it will turn your tips brown!  </li>
            <li>I would also suggest exfoliating your skin first!</li>
            <li>Color fades FAST!!</li>
            <li>Have recommend to several friends who also love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>but I just blotted it on with the left overs on the mit and it turned out lovely!</li>
            <li>Will not order again and threw remainder, after first application , in garbage !</li>
            <li>SO PRETTY!</li>
            <li>People compliment on how pretty my complexion is!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it enough, Fake Bake Flawless is amazing!</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle and we don&#x27;t get enough sun to get a great tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product for anyone, but especially for those new to self tanning, as I was.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am looking for a different one though that doesn&#x27;t come off as easily and moisturizes my body more.</li>
            <li>This is such an easy to get a healthy tan look without being in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I love how the product doesnt have such a strong smell.</li>
            <li>So easy to blend and dries in an instant:]</li>
            <li>For someone with very light skin, Fake Bake gives a nice glow that easily develops into a more bronzed color.</li>
            <li>As far as the glove goes, its very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>good at first then a few hours later its not so great smelling...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have heard good thing about tanning mouse for men and will definitely give that a shot as well as that is known to work great with hair as well and is generally suggested for dudes and may come back and adjust this review if need be after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>it has no annoying smeel as all other sun tanners do and application fool proof- very easy and smooth</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Great product for very pale skin if a light color is desired.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see this go on so sheer &amp; light while quickly drying.</li>
            <li>Best part of using fake bake is that it&#x27;s the perfect color for pale people and you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also super pale and was happy this didn&#x27;t look unnatural or orange.</li>
            <li>However, I certainly think I look healthier and more vibrant with some color on my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and quick to apply, dries quickly (smells like coconut), and gives very natural looking results.  </li>
            <li>When reviewing a self-tan product, I believe it&#x27;s extremely important to introduce certain characteristics of the author in order for readers to determine whether the product should apply to them.</li>
            <li>It tends to wash off a little lighter than I prefer, but it is still a great product.</li>
            <li>I used to love Sublime, but Fake Bake color is beautiful and rich even after one application.</li>
            <li>So little confidence boosts are always welcome.  </li>
            <li>Looks so natural!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the smoothest, best smelling, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; (The bottle does drip a little bit.)</li>
            <li>If used correctly you&#x27;ll have a pretty beautiful dark tan!</li>
            <li>I would honestly invest in something a little more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow this little bottle is awesome...</li>
            <li>I gave it a 2 because the smell is actually pleasant unlike other spray tans.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant, almost like a soft coconut oil, definitely NOT strong or overpowering like most products.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>My husband is a very fair person, with pasty white skin and especially his legs.  </li>
            <li>its the best one ive tried so far its a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The mitt not only keeps application clean and easy, but helps show where you already applied!</li>
            <li>But its not as strong as other tanners and comes off once you shower, and honestly for the color</li>
            <li>The first time I did it very lightly since I was new to it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this after reading positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and package was secure.</li>
            <li>The color guide is great for even coverage, it can be a bit harsh to walk around with though-</li>
            <li>The mitt works really well for applying the product so it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It has great color payoff, but if you want to be darker you can use it a few days in a row until you achieve the color you want.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the most important thing we&#x27;re looking for in a self tanner (the color) is not so great.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply and it has a great, subtle smell.</li>
            <li>An amazing homemade sugar scrub to use before applying mix 1/2 a cup of sugar brown or white and 1/4 coconut oil and use in the shower (or anytime)</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and never goes on unevenly.</li>
            <li>The mit really helps for a streak free tan.</li>
            <li>Gave me a great color after a few applications.</li>
            <li>Spray some on the velvet side and lightly buff over your whole body.</li>
            <li>Only used it once, but it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>it really gives me the tan look, but I do not feel comfortable wearing it during the day.</li>
            <li>Once I did that the next day I had an amazing \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, a bronze \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>you pay very close attention to what you&#x27;re doing and exfoliate beforehand, add a dab of oil to knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly,</li>
            <li>This is probably the most natural looking self tanner I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many fake tanners and this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I read the and reviews, my gut instinct felt it would turn out like a similar product I own, St. Moriz.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice deep color ( Not Orange).</li>
            <li>I went to bed that night with a tan smile on my face.</li>
            <li>and I know how frustrating the hunt for the perfect tanner can be</li>
            <li>(DHA always has a distinct smell after it develops, but the smell is tropical until then).  </li>
            <li>I moved far out of town and couldn&#x27;t get a salon tan any more.</li>
            <li>But its worth the money with the gloves and everything.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>It is so fun</li>
            <li>But it is worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and I was even able to apply it to my feet and still look like a natural tan.  </li>
            <li>The results make it totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>More importantly it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes the next day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural, and is so much better for your skin than a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>The color is so natural, I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li>There is literally no inconvenient aspect to this spray.</li>
            <li>I actually used it one morning and showered in an hour and still had a nice color-</li>
            <li>With 3 uses, the bottle is still pretty full.</li>
            <li>Get compliments constantly on how \\&quot;nice and tanned I am\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Super easy and super natural.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Wow this is my favorite tanner.  </li>
            <li>Recently my dermatologist told me to stay out of the sun and honestly I don&#x27;t like sitting out anyway</li>
            <li>I bought mine from Amazon for $13 - definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It produces a really nice golden color, dries instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every sunless tanner out there and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I can get everywhere on my own except for my back</li>
            <li>i have used a million self tanners and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This technique seems to decrease the amount of product absorbed my the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone desiring a more natural, bronze glow.</li>
            <li>Love it and have bought 3 bottles so far.</li>
            <li>so by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li>use a blend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps.lend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>I have a medium olive complexion and this gives much more of a natural tanned glow to my skin compared to the St Tropez.</li>
            <li>Most natural.</li>
            <li>As a pasty white gal, I get a great NATURAL looking tan that doesn&#x27;t make me look rusty or streaky.</li>
            <li>- the color was the only thing I liked a bit</li>
            <li>I think it even looks more brown and natural than when I use tanning beds,</li>
            <li>So far it looks really good and natural.</li>
            <li>It looks great and natural when it is applied but does not last.</li>
            <li>Golden glow, never orange,</li>
            <li>The color is a nice golden brown, which is the only star this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is the most natural look I&#x27;ve ever come across from any gel, cream, liquid or wipe (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot).</li>
            <li>It took me a couple times to master it, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, both expensive and cheap, but this has by far been the best yet.</li>
            <li>and it gave me a nice tan the next day</li>
            <li>I tried it a couple more times and still had the same problem, My best friend was trying it at the same time as well and had the same complaints.</li>
            <li>have fun putting it on</li>
            <li>but it dsnt smell nice anymore (7 hours later).</li>
            <li>It turned my skin a golden brown color upon application(not</li>
            <li>Returns are going ok so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially it leaves you with a bit of a golden tan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments and everyone is surprised its self tanner.</li>
            <li>The most natural.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice instant color.</li>
            <li>and I thought the spray and mitt was a cool concept being that besides jergens glow this was the first sunless tanner I ever tried.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t worth it in my book.</li>
            <li>I have always used Fake Bake Flawless because of its simple application and really good color.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>Almost instantly gave me some nice color.</li>
            <li>Worth a try and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This color of fake tanning is great, never orange always nice brown tanned color.</li>
            <li>I have bought every self tanner on the market and despite all of them claiming to be the most natural looking tan around, always end up making me look like a walking Dorito.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to wear shorts</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a good chunk of time reading over the reviews for tips on how to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worked well for my purpose, has a decent smell, easy to use, and no orange color to it.</li>
            <li>It actually looks like a real tan and smells pretty nice too!</li>
            <li>The color is the most natural that I have obtained.</li>
            <li>I love that this product delivers immediate, natural looking color.  </li>
            <li>but I think it well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>After a shower it does provide a really nice, even tan for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Nice, deep tan.</li>
            <li>Apply it consecutive days to deepen color, moisturize between applications and be sure to exfoliate well prior to applying to ensure a smooth, long-lasting tan.  </li>
            <li>I used this product once and the color was nice but lasted only one day.</li>
            <li>and you actually look like you have a nice tan</li>
            <li>This rinses off in the shower (make sure you wait a few hours) and leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Best product for fake tan have light skin and doesn&#x27;t turn orange leaves</li>
            <li>My own hold back for not giving this product</li>
            <li>I maybe going to use it this winter when I&#x27;ll turn completely white just to give myself a kind of &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It provides good color but any rough spots on your skin will be highlighted.</li>
            <li>Most said because it was old.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, looks natural not orange</li>
            <li>It is the most natural looking, streak-free self tanner I have used.</li>
            <li>Educate yourself, being brown isn&#x27;t worth your life.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it looks so natural</li>
            <li>I am outside kind of a lot</li>
            <li>I usually do 2 thin layers, and it covers evenly and perfectly!  </li>
            <li>but I found the color is not as golden on me...</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless system is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When you wake up, you have to take a shower, otherwise, the tan won&#x27;t look natural, more of an orange color.</li>
            <li>but it was handled so fast and with such good customer service</li>
            <li>The muddy colored guide rubs in, making sure you apply completely.</li>
            <li>My favorite besides the natural looking tan you get is the scent...</li>
            <li>: ) My boyfriend has also used this product and he loves the natural color it gives.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you want to be tan for the night, but as soon as you shower the following day all the color completely washes off.</li>
            <li>and wow I am glad I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it actually smells kind of tropical.</li>
            <li>I used one from my old hairpump bottles, its got a better stream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is totally worth spending 15 dollars a month on as opposed to 80 dollars on a tanning membership</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self tanners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also, spray the product directly on your skin because if you spray on the mitt, it absorbs most of the product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of necessary...</li>
            <li>I figured she had been to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than lotion type, looks natural.</li>
            <li>It is the most natural looking tan you can get in a bottle and the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li>but it is a golden Brown and not Orange</li>
            <li>, I think its amazing , and fast, not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>there is and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It gives such a nice tan to your skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hesitant about trying a non-lotion tanner like I was, this is well worth the chance.</li>
            <li>I thought they all were, it gave me a nice brown tan instantly.</li>
            <li>this spray just gives me the most golden bronze natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I love how it naturally gets darker with each</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to have finally found this product!</li>
            <li>I used two days worth of coats</li>
            <li>So if you ever need to reduce the color absorbed around toes or joints...</li>
            <li>Everything went on nicely with the mit except for my upper thigh area...</li>
            <li>I REALLY liked the deep brown color before the color guard was washed off.</li>
            <li>It works and looks natural for sure.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself allergic or sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes off but I dont mind that since then it looks fresh.</li>
            <li>I was so nervous about using a self tanner, but application is easy, clean, and completely even.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful,it looks natural and steak free!</li>
            <li>FAR has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my white legs, stayed on for about three days then naturally stared to fade.  </li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few self tanners and this is so far the best Ive used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I liked the color of this product and the application was fairly simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth not leaving tan everywhere.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure to wash the glove after tanning otherwise it wont be as soft overtime and might crack.</li>
            <li>All in all, this product is a definite must if you want a nice tan for this summer while saving your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>so it looks like you were freshly out tanning in the sun.</li>
            <li>and I look golden all the time.</li>
            <li>he would know if this came from some old can but had NO idea till I told hime :)))))</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Def worth the money to try this product tho</li>
            <li>the results were better as far as streaks go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the natural tone</li>
            <li>I got some spots on my legs where the procuct was left in my pores but after exfoliating, it cleaned uo nicely.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you exfoliate really well before hand, and really rub it all in.</li>
            <li>ankles!&lt;br /&gt;the color is a nice golden brown, not orange or red.</li>
            <li>Find out if it worth to try</li>
            <li>can only compare this to loreal sublime bronze and banana boat for light skin and this product is far superior to either .</li>
            <li>I used and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>but I expected a lot better results using this after reading the reviews - I of course exfoliated and made sure I had no product (lotion) on before application</li>
            <li>Overall, nice product.</li>
            <li>Try Bronzbody, it’s worth the bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I cannot count how many differnt tanning products that I have tried attempting to give myself a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth some of the faux pas that I can overlook.</li>
            <li>Totally worth your money.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had was some coming off on my pajamas as I let it set over night, so don&#x27;t wear nice pj&#x27;s with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have found the golden tanning ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>these 2 together, apply every 2 days, and you will be a silken golden tan goddess for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have light/medium golden skin and it looks just like my skin when it is tan.</li>
            <li>I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li>it would be nice to have an extra cloth with it but workes well,</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t streak and lasts for several days if applied properly, I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li>So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money, and</li>
            <li>It dries super quick, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong, feels light on your body, and the color guide is awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of girl who researches a product in-depth prior to purchasing</li>
            <li>I love the color and the fact that you can rub it in seamlessly with the mitt that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The bronzer washes off in the shower and you&#x27;re left with nice, natural-looking color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My only gripe about this product is actually a good thing, and that&#x27;s that it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the results are so natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It definitely leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It was a much  more reasonably priced option and it actually got better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only reason for not giving this product 5 stars is the &#x27;tan&#x27; starts fading in 2-3 days and starts looking kind of blotchy, so the cycle must be repeated.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far better than any drug store product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>There is no bad smell, which is a first for self tanning products.  </li>
            <li>It is a quick and easy tanning system for a very busy mom that I am.</li>
            <li>love it 4 stars though since it states floral smell and is supposed to have no smell the smell is not bad compared to many other products I just am waiting for a zero smell product !</li>
            <li>I am quite pale, and I was happy with the initial application as the color guide is a nice, bronze color.</li>
            <li>Hands down amazing product!</li>
            <li>sure not to get any water or lotion on yourself after applying for at least 4 hours, but right after I put it on my hands I find putting a tiny bit of lotion of my knuckles smooths out any lines and makes it look perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it definitely delivers a nice brown tan but it washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised... I&#x27;ve tried other sunless tanning products on my very fair skin but they end up looking blotchy and orange.</li>
            <li>I have been telling others how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural!!</li>
            <li>I am an avid user/lover of this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, easy, non-streaky affordable self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to apply though you just have to blend it fast</li>
            <li>Its fast and easy and it really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no mess, no horrible odor</li>
            <li>give you super dark color right away, so you can achieve a good color that works for your skin</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li>The glove is kind of a joke, and a hassle having to wear another glove underneath, but the color is pretty good, doesn&#x27;t stink too bad, not too much color, lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to leave streaks due to too many layers of tanner or too many attempts to blend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: This is still my favorite tanner months after my original purchase, and after trying several others including mousses and sprays.</li>
            <li>It smells better than most other self</li>
            <li>Recently purchased the FB original lotion and love it.  </li>
            <li>I know I am one of the many 5 star reviewers of this product, but I give it 5 stars for a reason many of the other reviewers may not know about.</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t as toxic as many other brands too.</li>
            <li>will give this one more try before I order the other one again:).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>DHA has been found to be deposited in the lung and other tissue thanks to this great vehicle.  </li>
            <li>Having used other topical tanning agents I can say the best use of this product is for the BODY.  </li>
            <li>and I get my legs and stomach done in less than five minutes which is get nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years, and this is the best yet (by a mile).</li>
            <li>it gives a believable tan and smells significantly better than other tanners I have used.  </li>
            <li>I think all of the self tanners have a significant odor,until  somebody will find a better chemical what reaches the same effect;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly and also washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It drys super fast!</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>No streaks, no weird smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>You really need to make sure you rub it in nice and even but holy cow.</li>
            <li>So I got this product pretty quickly</li>
            <li>and it washes off pretty quick.</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty quickly compared to some of the others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>AFter the first application I wasn&#x27;t so quick to throw them out...</li>
            <li>The mitt can soak up a lot of product- when spray the product on my skin and use the mitt quickly in circular motions, it is evident that a lot of the product is soaking into the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quick and I have not had any issues with it rubbing off on my sheets, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty even color, I&#x27;m sill getting used to how quickly it dries</li>
            <li>it dries pretty quick ..</li>
            <li>IT DRYS SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li>It has proven useful when I&#x27;m looking kinda sickly pale and can just slap some on (dries super quickly and yes, smells good) for a night out</li>
            <li>It develops very nicely over a few hours.</li>
            <li>After reading so many rave reviews I had high expectations for Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but it leaves you with the most beautiful fake tan you can get.</li>
            <li>(I only apply self tanner to my legs) and the best part, I only need to apply this once to achieve a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>To begin with I have a very fair complexion, dark hair, light blue eyes and tons of freckles of every shape and size.</li>
            <li>&quot; &amp; there are many other products I use &amp;have used that are similar or much better &amp; they&#x27;re at cheaper prices on here ( Amazon) , so why settle?!!?  </li>
            <li>It goes on super quick, dries fast and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, quick drying, gradually builds color, looks natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead/fair skinned, I burn super easy and never tan naturally.</li>
            <li>But, seriously, this is a very good self tanner.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that bright orange that some tanners have turned me, but it was still orangey and not a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and was concerned about streaking, color quality, and splotches, issues with other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>Smells good compared to other tans in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>However the tan is superior to any other product I have used (which is TONS) in terms of color, evenness,etc.</li>
            <li>So the gloves create a nice friction that keep the mitt on pretty much completely throughout the process and it solved my problem If I were to really try to find a con</li>
            <li>You just have to be sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots, after my first application I didn&#x27;t really get around my mouth very well</li>
            <li>but other then thta works good on legs</li>
            <li>It smells really good and is not orange like other products</li>
            <li>AS WELL ,THAT MIGHT BE WHY OTHER FAIR SKIN PEOPLE SAID THEM</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t layer the product like some do, I would HIGHLY recommend a good body scrub once it starts to wear off especially before applying another layer.</li>
            <li>Left a nice, even color very fast.</li>
            <li>That said I have searched high and low for a good self tanner and</li>
            <li>I will most likely use this for special occasions.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>These reviews were right.</li>
            <li>so it fits right and closes tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I recommend shaving right before also..</li>
            <li>I put it on right before I went to bed and then rinsed off in the morning</li>
            <li>and they were right -</li>
            <li>but I could wash them and it came right out.</li>
            <li>I tried it on one hand right away using the mitt.</li>
            <li>and this is right up there with St. Tropez.</li>
            <li>It does not leave you streaky or orange and provides just the right about of color</li>
            <li>but it washed right off.</li>
            <li>Some tanners come right off and defeats the purpose of trying to look tan in a bikini.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trying to apply once without the latex glove and discovered that the tanner just seeps right through the mit onto your hand.  </li>
            <li>so I can put on my pajamas right after and go to bed.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>I feel like the tan washes off right away.</li>
            <li>It rinses right off the tub.</li>
            <li>I spray it right on my skin and blend in with mitt.  </li>
            <li>I guess I prefer a lotion, but I would get this again if the price was right.</li>
            <li>I can put on my pajamas right after and there is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you know right away if you have missed spots.</li>
            <li>Comes right off.  </li>
            <li>but it washes right out.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not.</li>
            <li>It works right away and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I put a tad of lotion on my elbows, knees and ankles/feet right before applying</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail yesterday and applied right away...</li>
            <li>and I have no time to return it to get what the right thing.</li>
            <li>You will look tanner right after applying because there&#x27;s a bronzer in it</li>
            <li>It dries in about 10-15 minutes and you can jump right into bed without fear of staining linens.</li>
            <li>but it washes right out in the washing</li>
            <li>You can also layer it, one application right after another one, to achieve quicker and darker results.  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>It did turn my pi&#x27;s orange but washed right out.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get the application JUST right, the color is mismatched and blotchy looking until you take a shower.</li>
            <li>Just washed them well right after.</li>
            <li>You have to be committed to do it right.  </li>
            <li>The product washes right off.</li>
            <li>Right before I stopped using the product it was like smelling gas fumes.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and did this right off the bat and had no problems with the bottle leaking.</li>
            <li>its exactly right.</li>
            <li>but then right before i ordered it online</li>
            <li>then in circular motions rub it right on.</li>
            <li>PLUS, this literally drys right away, and you can put your clothes on as soon as you are done.(if</li>
            <li>So on went my quest to finding the right solution for me.</li>
            <li>right after its applied</li>
            <li>I prefer to use this stuff right after I take a shower, &amp; before bed.</li>
            <li>It seems as if it washes right off but</li>
            <li>The smell is so yummy like coconuts, I apply it right before bed</li>
            <li>Should have noticed it right away by the bottle that this wasn&#x27;t a continuous spray which makes a lot of spotted and blotched areas on the body;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, right away you can see the color change.</li>
            <li>I applied the spray right onto my body and then rubbed it in with the mit.</li>
            <li>I can get dressed literally right after using it, and leaving it on all day while going about your business is no problem either.</li>
            <li>I like the application mitt and the fact that you can see where it applys on your skin then disappears but for me it just isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
            <li>I applies it right after I showered.  </li>
            <li>&quot; right away with the color guide, if you will, so I don&#x27;t need to wait 4 hours until it shows up.</li>
            <li>right in the shower itself.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my skin color right away.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right.</li>
            <li>If you wipe it immediately with rubbing alcohol it should just come right off though .</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it right before you go out somewhere.</li>
            <li>I use it right after showering and lotioning and I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking or clumps of color.</li>
            <li>right after applying-</li>
            <li>Wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters , right?</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It gives just the right shade.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on schedule.</li>
            <li>noticed color right away, but</li>
            <li>I even use this on my face and rub it in with my hands, and then scrub my hands with a nail brush right away to keep the developer from turning my palms orange.</li>
            <li>: I know it says to spray on the mitt, but I just spray it right on the skin and immediately rub it in with the mitt.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t turn me orange, didn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, even right after I applied it, it didn&#x27;t streak, and it looked</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the product right before you exfoliate, because it will take off some of your tan.</li>
            <li>I use it right after, then every 3 days after that.</li>
            <li>pale skin now has that beachy, beautiful, golden brown color that I absolutely</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless spray is my new favorite way to tan.  </li>
            <li>The only downside which I have seen in other reviews is the leaking spray top!!!</li>
            <li>All in all the color is great, the smell isn&#x27;t bad, it dries really fast, the color guide is really helpful, and it is an all-around great product!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, decent smell, and pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to clean up in a shower.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries amazingly fast (you can still add more to the dry parts to add more color or even out a streak) and doesn&#x27;t get on clothes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I have used it a couple of days in a row, I notice that the color builds, even when I clean my face with a gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li>it is how easy and fast I can get a tan with fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li>far as when to start your first application:  Again, this is just my observation -  it might be better if you&#x27;re doing stuff around the house to apply it then</li>
            <li>No streaks, no orange, smell is decent and it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Turn on your AC or make sure the room is cool enough that you don&#x27;t sweat -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking.</li>
            <li>Yes there&#x27;s a bit more prep than you would have with the average drugstore product but nothing over the top.</li>
            <li>It never oncesmelled like the typical sunless tanners (I liken it to rotten fruit), instead the pleasant coconut smell went away throughout the night</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is just as good as the salon spray tan except waaay better on my pocket book and easy to apply at home.</li>
            <li>It gives a more natural looking tan at first, and as you build it up you get darker and darker.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really notice that its everywhere until you clean your bathroom...</li>
            <li>Smell kinda like accelerator, but overall pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>not weird looking but really natural healthy glow to me rather than</li>
            <li>I just use a normal bronzer powder and I match just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they told me this when I got sprayed professionally at a salon, but I must have forgotten it.</li>
            <li>Looks completely natural, dries super quick, not sticky at all!  </li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, not orange at all, a dark brown tone like you&#x27;d want, and its instant!</li>
            <li>The only slight issue I have is the microfiber mitt starts to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; (like a sweatshirt), even though I wash it between uses, but I would be happy to purchase more mitts in order to keep my tan going.</li>
            <li>a nice bronze, not to dark, not to light, color.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you do not like wearing a self tanner with a dark color guard you can definately apply this after a good exfoliating shower at night, and then rinse if off in the morning for a fresh tanned glow.</li>
            <li>tanner is sooooo easy to apply and very natural looking too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to apply, especially with the mit that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and the color is very natural.</li>
            <li>The color guard makes this so easy and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The mit is very soft and easy to use, but beware--I had some fuzzies come off and get onto my skin.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It smells GREAT, it works QUICKLY, and you&#x27;ll actually look TAN, not orange, streaky, or any other bizarre color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product and I highly recommend it for first time tanners like myself since it was so easy.</li>
            <li>, the smell is great (because you know that self tanners can have a weird after smell), and it is so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>From cheap to high dollar.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Fake Bake spray, and it is quick and fast and did a good job, but makes a huge mess in my bathroom, which is why I decided to try the Flawless.</li>
            <li>The smell I find quite pleasant and is just tropical not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, looks like a natural tan!</li>
            <li>The mitt is intimidating, but totally easy and looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and appears natural!</li>
            <li>Finally someone that did it right!!!</li>
            <li>After using many products on my pure white legs, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did do a full intense full body exfoliating first and that likely made a big difference, as well as the great mitt that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li>I am extremely fair skinned darn right glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>I cover up in a light  lose sarong for an hour or two so that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>I burn so easily that it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to get a natural tan.</li>
            <li>Gives great color and the smell is not too terribly strong but still not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I spray on the glove (soft side) and scrub lightly (but quickly).</li>
            <li>Works really well, easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I would suggest only doing one arm at a time and doing your legs in two sections (top and bottom) because the product dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is clean and free of all oils, I wipe down with a skin cleaning astringent, 3.Let</li>
            <li>Color good but messy to apply and wears off quickly and rubs off onto my clothes.</li>
            <li>It is not a &amp;#34;bahama&amp;#34; tan but looks very natural with my tone (I am fair skin and blonde hair).  </li>
            <li>I would like to wear shorts year-round if I could, but now that I am a senior citizen I am becoming self-conscious about the looks of my bony old legs.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanners, but Fake Bake is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>junk, washed off after first shower, left it on overnight, adn waited a full 24hours b4 showering, just junk, threw it out and bought Tan Towels, from Ulta, way better no smell adn no residue to wash off, dont use this junk of you</li>
            <li>No more stinky faces from my husband, lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanning products and this one definitely wins first prize.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a great self tanner for a few years now, and this is IT!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and not stinky at all, I usually cover it up with cologne anyway.</li>
            <li>I have used several different types of self tanner and this has been the best by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else experienced this</li>
            <li>have tanned my whole body four times, and the bottle is still fairly full (1/2?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very happy to have found something that looks natural even though its fake :)</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t tried too many different ones, this one goes on smoothly and there really aren&#x27;t any streaks.</li>
            <li>I usually apply this stuff 1 or 2 times a week, &amp; it works great that way.</li>
            <li>am light skinned, borderline fair skin, so it means a lot if something actually gives me an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The orange color is much more apparent in the wedding pictures than is visible by the eye.  </li>
            <li>I used a patting/dabbing technique to apply a small amount of liquid to my hands and feet and it seemed to work great.</li>
            <li>however, I replaced it with a clean spray nozzle from a half empty body spray which worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It evened out my blotchy paleness and made my skin in general look so much better.</li>
            <li>Great smell usually.</li>
            <li>The bronzer/color guide looks pretty orange after you put it on, but if you exfoliate in the shower and apply it at night, you will have a golden brown glow after you shower it off in the morning.</li>
            <li>My husband is happy about that because he hates the smell of tanner usually.</li>
            <li>When morning came, there were no stains on my clothes or bedding, surprising because of the dark color guide.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the easiest and most mess free product I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>so I burn all summer long and never get nice color.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my face and it looks really good, not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and I can honestly say it has never EVER</li>
            <li>I think it is a GOOD product, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Everything i&#x27;ve tried would leave me real streaky, not bad color, but the streaking was just way too embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It goes on dark and is a good color.  </li>
            <li>I am pale and this gives me a nice easy tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fair skin and super pale legs</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs thus far), dries super fast with a pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li>As someone new to self tanning, I feel like this was pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>But the shade of my skin right now looks so natural and the mitt it comes makes blending so easy and eliminates any streaking.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic self tanner though, and a must have for us pale girls wanting some safe color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out.</li>
            <li>It gives you a pretty dark tan (I am fair skinned) right away</li>
            <li>My thoughts and views are my own and are for the sole purpose of helping others know what to expect in certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>The instructions are very thorough and if you follow them, you will have a great color right away that lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and it sprays on with no mess!</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s such an easy product to use!</li>
            <li>This is our second year of using it, the color isn&#x27;t orange at all &amp; the mitt makes application easy with no streaking!</li>
            <li>This item took a little while to ship, but the actual product is great!</li>
            <li>but it is perfect for upcoming events when you want a little extra color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bottle, just to make sure I have it whenever the first one runs out !</li>
            <li>When you shower in the morning you&#x27;re left with an awesome little glow.</li>
            <li>it smells great and has an unbelievably realistic brown glow unlike other self tanners that turn your skin a funky orange oompa loompa color!</li>
            <li>This pale girl has a nice brown tan!</li>
            <li>I have tried many things in the past, and this makes my problem skin areas look more natural than most things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it is so easy to apply with the mitt and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky like most other ma do.</li>
            <li>I suggest light strokes and maybe a new pad because the pad keeps flying off my hands.</li>
            <li>This is wash the tan right off and you will have to do the whole process all over again!</li>
            <li>Id say around 8am or 9am and after the movie her was orange on his leg right in the exact spot he his leg on mine</li>
            <li>Even without the base tan though I was extremely happy with the streak free, easy application, BROWN not orange results :)</li>
            <li>, It was really easy to rub on and for a spray bottle it was not messy at all in thee</li>
            <li>Natural looking and easy.  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast</li>

            <li>Dries super fast.</li>

            <li>It was easy to apply and made me look like I had a natural tan.</li>
            <li>Despite the mitt being flimsy, I still give this product five stars for looking so natural and being so easy to use.</li>

            <li>A nice, deep brown with ruddy undertones as if you had really been in the sun that day.</li>

            <li>the tan looks so natural and dries really fast:).</li>
            <li>Natural looking, easy to apply, watch you tube videos.</li>

            <li>If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin I WOULD NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li>though I love it and it works fast and looks natural.</li>
            <li>fake bake goes on easily and smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  </li>
            <li>I have found I like using this sunless tanner best a few days after a spray tan to make it last a bit longer.</li>
            <li>So finally I decided to try this product just for fun, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not orangy, looks natural and not stinky.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally olive skin and tan easily.</li>
            <li>now I can have it year round and for such a great price!!</li>
            <li>My (now-husband) jokingly called me pumpkin hands for the rest of the day, but luckily it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable in the pictures.</li>
            <li>And super fast delivery</li>
            <li>Leaves a natural looking tan and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It dries very quick and so far no staining on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks natural</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll apply and have a slight one, then wake up with a gorgeous one.</li>
            <li>I think all self-tanners can be a pain to use but this one dries quick which I really like.</li>
            <li>The tan is natural looking and the product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Take your time applying and be sure to buff the product in gently and completely.</li>
            <li>but the tan comes out perfect color and last a few days.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft feeling and loved the color it gave me..</li>
            <li>Also you have to use quite a bit and put it on fast, it settles quickly and you could get spots darker than others.</li>
            <li>fake n bake its super easy to use and the color looks great</li>
            <li>The actual product was good, it gave an even natural colour.  </li>
            <li>I am white, very white and this works so great and doesn&#x27;t look orange at all (unless you don&#x27;t apply it as directed).</li>
            <li>This gives a really natural and buildable bronze color and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and i normally have pretty light skin.</li>
            <li>Not messy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Dark hair follicules, scars, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased 12 boxes of this thinking for certain this was going to be the best product I have tried and seen.</li>
            <li>actually quite pleasant and not expected!  </li>
            <li>, it gets SUPER dark and SUPER intense brown/orange right away, so I go to bed like 30 minutes after applying it, let it deepen overnight, and then when I wash it off in the shower it looks amazing like a real tan!</li>
            <li>This product is better than most, however it is not very dark once you wash the bronzer off, the bottle only lasts me about a month, and places like me</li>
            <li>I threw mine in the dryer on high heat for about 10 minutes and it came out clean and fuzz-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have just gotten more and more pale.</li>
            <li>It applies very easily and mess free.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly and looks natural!</li>
            <li>The color developed into a natural looking, dark brown, beautiful color that  lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li>For someone who has spent Lots of $ and Lots of time in tanning beds I love this product!</li>
            <li>okay , i first got this as a gift a few months ago &amp; immediately got more .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>Love this self tanner doesnt streak but does get on light colored clothes if its hot out and your sweating or getting wet</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of uses to get the full color you are wanting, depending on how dark you like your tan, but I was seeing nice color after just the first application/rinse.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is so fair it is pretty much see through, and it makes me look like I have spent time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I did put more on my left leg than right, because it was darker.</li>
            <li>Not having the spray nozzle made applying this a hassle and honestly not worth the effort when there are MANY products with an easy spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>This came super fast and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Color is SO natural, application is SO easy and so fast!</li>
            <li>the first use!&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to you, the directions say to spray directly onto the mitt and then rub onto the body</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the color is natural and pretty.  </li>
            <li>It looks pretty natural and is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Nice and dark, super even finish.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I have repurchased several times because the tan is really build able and comes out very dark.</li>
            <li>Was easy to apply and really no mess at all.  </li>
            <li>and I consider the price very very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to very GENTLY apply the tanner, otherwise your mit will become pilly and crunchy (and won&#x27;t absorb the tanner liquid the way it&#x27;s supposed to).</li>
            <li>What I do like very much about</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Looks very much like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and left no streaks for me.</li>
            <li>so I ended up not using it very much at all.</li>
            <li>* Dries very fast and not sticky.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and it leaves no streakes.</li>
            <li>color looks very real.</li>
            <li>it dries very fast</li>
            <li>The problem is that even if you follow all instructions it still seems to wear off very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very fast too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reapplied before going to work as I didn&#x27;t see where the product had rubbed off very much on my sheets or blankets</li>
            <li>was very reasonable .</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>wear white or very light /expensive</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly and lasts for a solid week.</li>
            <li>Well, I am very, very fair-skinned, so I ordered this product with a bit of hesitation.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast (2 min) and does not leave stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in early spring before prom and all of the other senior activities that I wanted to look great for.</li>
            <li>Most other products I won&#x27;t use on my face just because they don&#x27;t go on smoothly and the color is always off.  </li>
            <li>Reviews on Fake Bake Flawless made it sound as though they had solved all of these issues.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and mitt work very well for a quick, easy application, and I love the delicate coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Blends smooth, better than other Fakies.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a beautiful subtle color.     </li>
            <li>, it is good for those times where you just need a quick instant glow, and your product will last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, so you&#x27;ve got to keep moving, but it&#x27;s worth it, as you can put on clothes without worrying about staining,  or if applied before bed, your sheets won&#x27;t become intimate with your faux color.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, the color looks very natural and streak-free (thanks to the blending mitt and color guide mixed in).</li>
            <li>Success is largely in the technique.  </li>
            <li>Good product, however it does leave me a little bit orange at times.</li>
            <li>Gives a good tan, But a little orange like and streaky.</li>
            <li>Super easy application and instant color</li>
            <li>I love taking the sun, but every year, I&#x27;ve become more weary about absorbing the rays for more than a half hour for obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li>Its super easy to put on , especially if you&#x27;ve never used self tanner before .</li>
            <li>Super easy to use (especially with the provided glove)</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and quick with the mitt being so big, and you can see it go on</li>
            <li>It dries right away which is great for me because I am a not good a using sunless tanning products, I always rush and want to get dressed right away</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, we all feel better and look better with a little color to our skin!</li>
            <li>and then shower to get the full effect (I highly recommend shaving at night and then going to bed with the tanner and showering off in the a.m.)</li>
            <li>Now maybe I just use too much, since I am VERY light skinned, it takes a whole lot (like 6 sprays on each leg directly onto the skin) to get me a tanned color.</li>
            <li>The little bottle goes a long way and the gloves included help application to be flawless.</li>
            <li>was looking for a great self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t cost too much, would give me a great, even, strong tan (that doesn&#x27;t look fake like those girls people make fun of, but one that actually would look as if I just got back from a vacation in the Caribbean) for someone like me-</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve been on a beach vacation ( I wish) since my life does not allow me enough sun time this new bottle of magic gives me that sun kissed look without the sun!</li>
            <li>Build-up: admittedly I am not the best exfoliator, but if you don&#x27;t scrub this off completely before reapplying, you run the risk of serious build-up / brown flakiness (I tend to get it most in my inner elbows and neck).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just adding a little sanity to the love festival to say it&#x27;s great to use once in a while, and be careful around the eyes, don&#x27;t spray it etc...  </li>
            <li>You basically want to get your skin as bare and clean as possible in order for the product to go on smoothly with out blotches or streaks, this also helps to allow the product to really soak in, giving it more staying power.</li>
            <li>Received my product in good time, and the product never lets me down!</li>
            <li>i used a quarter of the bottle with two applications, took two applications to get a good color, very dark color gaurd</li>
            <li>Once you have done it a few times it is very easy!</li>
            <li>Is a good product however doesn&#x27;t last more than a day and isn&#x27;t very dark.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable, and easy to use self tanner.</li>
            <li>But color regardless, this stuff looks SO natural, I am now a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I usually use St Tropez, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>lasts a while, i would not use though without applying lotion to you skin first.</li>
            <li>but I heard that the fake bake flawless darker does</li>
            <li>(This is after I waited two hours for it to fully &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>This  version tends to streak a bit more than the lotion, the bronzer to \\&quot;show where it goes\\&quot; didn&#x27;t stand out enough for me</li>
            <li>read first review from Glenis Ewing.</li>
            <li>But this looks believable, I use only one \\&quot;coat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and i love that it is an instant tan.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless truly is what they say!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it actually works!!</li>
            <li>but it really is pretty set after 10 minutes or so.c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying the product does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this and use it daily.</li>
            <li>It produces a nice, natural, golden tan that I get compliments on regularly.</li>
            <li>It wears off pretty evenly and doesn&#x27;t look blotchy..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two days, and I have moisturized pretty well</li>
            <li>THE FIRST SELF TANNER</li>
            <li>and it really helped me out!  </li>
            <li>fast service !&lt;</li>
            <li>(he used it first).</li>
            <li>We did it on him for 4 days and he was very tan!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get the product at first.</li>
            <li>I ordered Fake Bake Flawless on my phone while in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was the first time I felt hope for this product.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it promised and my skin was glowing for days.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply same amount on each leg, arm etc.</li>
            <li>so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied it, so</li>
            <li>just finished using this for the first time</li>
            <li>I also LOVE that you can get the top of your hands which is usually a challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is the best!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no foul smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try Fake Bake Flawless - guess what?</li>
            <li>when you first start using this product, you need to put it on every time after you shower.</li>
            <li>Ohh, and the tan does look real!</li>
            <li>I love the color payoff with this product, especially if I use it two days in a row!.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine there is a similar product that works any better.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and BAM - a pretty tan that lasts ;)</li>
            <li>I have used several self tanners before but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and this product was pretty forgiving considering my hap hazard application process.</li>
            <li>I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>One of the best fake tanners out there</li>
            <li>the first time i used it and that happened i messaged the youtube guru who recommended the product and she suggested washing it.</li>
            <li>It was not a shocking color change that would cause second glances, but I can tell it took the glare off my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used tanners more recently with systems that were more expensive and looked alright, this looks amazing!</li>
            <li>No orange tint or funny streaks.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as it says, a medium bronze.</li>
            <li>It only  lasted about 3 days so if you use it make sure  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for first time users.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>After the tan has had several hours to do its magic, take a shower to rinse the residue off.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>Exfoliate first and moisturize, then apply the product.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid tanner for years.</li>
            <li>Love it would definitely buy again.</li>

            <li>I would recommend  the Fake Bake flawless that I just purchased.</li>
            <li>first time using this type of tanning solution.</li>
            <li>My tan has lasted about four days and there are signs of fading but not too much!</li>

            <li>This fake and bake is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>

            <li>love this fake tanner, works better than any I have tried and I even quit using my airbrush tanner machine because this is so much better and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most of it comes off when I shower the next day.</li>
            <li>Not fake bake though.</li>
            <li>First self tanner</li>
            <li>key with this product is to make sure you read the directions and WASH THE MIT AFTER EACH USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this fake bake spray is Awesome .</li>
            <li>It is not fake</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty thorough about blending it well to avoid any streakiness.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty thorough about blending it well to avoid any streakiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was not the case with Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the follow the instructions about doing the knees last as not apply it on your feet!  </li>
            <li>On my face I apply to the mitt first.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a spray.</li>
            <li>I was amazed, the color is so real and not orange at all, I am brown!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is truly FLAWLESS!  </li>
            <li>Self tanning.com rated Fake Bake Flawless in it&#x27;s top ten</li>
            <li>Ok after a month I FINALLY received this product.</li>
            <li>Now here is where I think this is funny.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had this condition you know first hand</li>
            <li>Almost done with my first bottle and going to buy</li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t impressed with first application, did second application the very next day</li>
            <li>One of my friends, an esthetician, referred me to Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li>She swore by it and said it is nearly error free every time.</li>
            <li>I saw exactly where it was being applied.</li>
            <li>and it faded really well!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless about 1 year ago and have been using it as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; and ordering it ever since.</li>
            <li>What drew me to this in the first place was the mitt and the fact that it was a liquid and not a lotion.</li>
            <li>favorite application tip I picked up from a girlfriend is this: Apply the product to your entire body (even the face!)</li>
            <li>, my sister was at my house the first time I used this</li>
            <li>My first self tanner ever</li>
            <li>I did and extra sudsing in the shower to make sure that there were no oils on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product-the low price is just a bonus.</li>
            <li>Love this product just purchased my second bottle.</li>
            <li>This seems to be one of the affordable higher end workable ones.</li>
            <li>and it helps SO much in preventing streaks!</li>
            <li>I like this the most out of any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used, but I still get an occasional streak.  </li>
            <li>but after the first day there were brown circles around the roots of my hair on my skin so you could realize it</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve used my one bottle many times &amp; still have plenty left.</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I am real fair and have tried so many sunless tanners only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t want to spend hours trying to get it on correctly so it doesn&#x27;t streak, etc.  </li>
            <li>I will say the first time  </li>
            <li>Love the color and for the price I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I look tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, I am not a regular tanner.</li>
            <li>Make the water as hot as you can tolerate</li>
            <li>The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous, which is a pocket.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it this last time.</li>
            <li>I can put it on so fast!</li>
            <li>BUY FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS!!!</li>
            <li>The mit really helps the product to glide on without streaking, and  protects  your hands from staining!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This Fake Bake liquid tanner is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li>Final color is not orange like most.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so I thought yes, first tanner</li>
            <li>It took sooooo many application and actual spritz of the product to get some color that I just stopped usinf it all togother.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It smells phenomenal and dries almost instantly!</li>
            <li>you get such a great look after just one use and everyone at work the next day thought it was a real tan.</li>
            <li>I use the fake bake flawless about once a week</li>
            <li>Might work for some others who have more time or maybe it will last longer for you!</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time and I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li>If you want to have that tan look without laying out in the hot sun</li>
            <li>For some reason, the uptake on the back of my hands is greater than elsewhere, maybe because my skin is drier there.  </li>
            <li>Best fake tan I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>This was also my first time using a spray method for tanning..</li>
            <li>this is the first tanning product i have used that works without streaks.</li>
            <li>Constantly repurchase because I&#x27;m always so satisfied.</li>
            <li>But, I am still a fan of this stuff and will more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li>The color guide in the product makes it beyond simple to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere.</li>
            <li>I exfoliated my legs first then applied with the applicatior glove.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>but if I can&#x27;t it never looks like there is a line, it blends very well!</li>
            <li>The first application blew my mind.</li>
            <li>so I am at a higher risk for skin cancer than some and tanning beds are just not for me.</li>
            <li>Performed exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>the first two times I bought it</li>
            <li>Even on my hands and tops of feet, no crazy lines or too much color deposited.  </li>
            <li>cut the inner straw attached to the sprayer as the top reviewer suggested, and have continued to wash the mitt after each application.</li>
            <li>* spray the MITT first.</li>
            <li>I use on face &amp; entire body - love it.</li>
            <li>the only problem is when u do take a shower most of it does come off.</li>
            <li>You can get that Healthy look without the the harmful effects of the Sun,and if applied correctly your not left with an orange tone.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store brands to higher end products &amp; everything in between.  </li>
            <li>Hence, my Fake Bake Flawless purchase.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I did at first.  </li>
            <li>the first night I tried it - thank goodness</li>
            <li>, I tried exfoliating first</li>
            <li>I really did was follow the directions!</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. :)</li>
            <li>but u have to be FAST when applying !</li>
            <li>The price absolutely can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many different brands of Self Tanners, I almost didn&#x27;t even bother with this one.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Depending on at what point you are in the application process (day 2 of the first 3 applications)</li>
            <li>I was almost embarrassed at first.  </li>
            <li>You get color after the first application and go from there.</li>
            <li>I shower first, shave my legs, apply my coconut oil moisturizer (Monoi oil,</li>
            <li>It is pretty goof</li>
            <li>Also, the bronzer which allows you to see where you&#x27;ve applied does come off on clothing/sheets and in water, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply this and go to the beach or pool without showering first</li>
            <li>This is the best fake tan I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My only lament is that I wish the color was more enduring.  </li>
            <li>This works fast!  </li>
            <li>But its much easier than using your hands!</li>
            <li>Very sastified!</li>
            <li>I have tried many a self-tanner in my day but this one goes above and beyond any I have ever</li>
            <li>The directions explain how to do it, so make sure to actually follow them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a red undertone.  </li>
            <li>Also fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Sometimes when i yawn a lot my eyes water and the first time this happed</li>
            <li>Over the years have I tried many &amp;#34;fake bakes&amp;#34; and now here is one with the actual name.</li>
            <li>It will eventually give you that self tanner smell, but when you first apply it, the product smells like coconuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty even...</li>
            <li>but the next day it looked alot better.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this from my salon after doing a spray tan and when I ran out, my salon didn&#x27;t have any in stock</li>
            <li>I thought I would check amazon to see if they carry it and sure enough!!  </li>
            <li>I read them and did exactly what they said do for application..</li>
            <li>I need something with more of an olive tone, and this definitely works.</li>
            <li>It came out a really pretty color IMMEDIATELY after application but washed off after one time in the pool...</li>
            <li>I was more hoping for something that actually alters your skin color.</li>
            <li>This is my ultimate FAVORITE sunless tanning product.</li>
            <li>Also a tad drying of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware too like</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different self tanners, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It really worked!</li>
            <li>Do follow the instructions and exfoliate well and shave before your first application</li>
            <li>It did make my butt and breast area match the rest of me though;)</li>
            <li>After applying the first application I went to bed, I woke up,rinsed off and was amazed.</li>
            <li>at least it is greatly reduced in this product.  </li>
            <li>love the product, and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve finally found one I love.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that because this seems to last me a while.</li>
            <li>I would definitely moisturize before hand to make it an even better even glow.</li>
            <li>You need to apply more than once a week if you shower daily.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake blends my tan lines perfect</li>
            <li>The point of this is, I still an on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>My first time using a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Great color, long lasting</li>
            <li>this seemed blotchy when i put it on first</li>
            <li>then I ran across Fake Bake Flawless.  </li>
            <li>However, you must exfoliate before you use it the first time</li>
            <li>I did it for the first time on Friday night, showered Saturday, and reapplied.</li>
            <li>The only color I get in the sun is red/pink and more freckles.</li>
            <li>Go lighter at first if you are worried, thats what I did</li>
            <li>but this stuff, even after the first application.</li>
            <li>Health First.  </li>
            <li>i will definitely be buying this again whenever i run out :)</li>
            <li>First of all, once this stuff settles on you, the tropical smell leaves and you smell like...chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t laid in one in weeks since I bought Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not on my short list of favorites either.</li>
            <li>(__(*)__)  </li>
            <li>First time I bought this</li>
            <li>This is absolutely going to be a staple in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my tan, and some have even asked if I recently returned from vacation.</li>
            <li>it must be used properly :)</li>
            <li>I like to apply the Tanwise mousse with the gloves and mitt from my Fake Bake kit and it always works perfectly.</li>
            <li>at first gonna try sun labs</li>
            <li>I did notice after the first use that the bottle does tend to leak some from the cap, so</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It has NO fake tan smell on your skin.</li>
            <li>The next morning, I was believably bronzed with nary a hint of chemical odor to give me away.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use, but used continuously for about 4 days and</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price, but fades way too quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best fake tanner stuff I&#x27;ve bought/tried/.</li>
            <li>I also cut the tube that is inserted into the bottle before first use, and have had no leakage as others have reported.</li>
            <li>To see exactly how to use this, go to youtube, type in SMLx0 and find her Fake Bake Flawless review!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, 100% Will be purchased again!</li>
            <li>So buy this if you need a pretty tan for a day or evening, but not if you&#x27;re sweating or swimming.  </li>
            <li>Shave FIRST 24 hours in advance of application.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, for the price, you are probably better off just going to a tanning</li>
            <li>I also made it a decision to add Fake Bake flawless into my weekly routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first at home spray tan</li>
            <li>No fake tan smell-</li>
            <li>The thing is is that this is my first time using a tanning product</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the patience and time to get the fake tan looking flawless for me.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best products from Fake N Bake.</li>
            <li>You can see exactly where you have sprayed it on and rubbed it in</li>
            <li>I cut the spray tube alittle smaller and it stops the product from leaking out of the top of the bottle when applying it.  </li>
            <li>but today is the first day.  </li>
            <li>I did not apply to arms as I&#x27;m already pretty tan on that area.  </li>
            <li>yes, love this stuff, would totally recommend and I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li>First of all I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday</li>
            <li>However, a year later I can confidently say this stuff is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tank top that I sweat in and the arm pits turned red 9 months ago.</li>
            <li>This is my first self tan product.</li>
            <li>The Fake Bake Flawless has worked well and does not seem to irritate my skin on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I still used it, and seems to work pretty  well.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does not make your skin turn that obnoxious orange color that you get from most self tanners.  </li>
            <li>Item was delivered a day before expected, which is always a nice surprise (:</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>It really does give u a glow!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give u a deep tan more of a bronze color.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless leaks ...</li>
            <li>this Sooooo much going to buy ALOTTT Moreeeeeee !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, the only thing I dislike is the glove you put it on with.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Well for the first time ever</li>
            <li>I will no longer use anything but Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many tanners but this one is the last I&#x27;ll ever use.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and it goes on very even!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Was pretty pleased overall with this product.  </li>
            <li>The tanner soaks through by the time you get done with your whole body, so you still end up with tanner to wash off your palms/fingers, which defeats the purpose of having a glove!  </li>
            <li>I think this is just because it&#x27;s the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan on using it much more in the future, especially as the weather gets warmer :)</li>
            <li>, i recommend going to find her video if you&#x27;re interested in it.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>I would recommend spraying on the glove first not yourself though.</li>
            <li>I tried the Fake Bake Flawless Darker after I finished my first bottle of this one, and I actually like the Darker better for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was one of those people who tan so much they look orange!</li>
            <li>We would shower and put fake bake flawless all over us before going out to dinner.(I</li>
            <li>We thought we looked pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t find anything that I like better, I will go back to this brand.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried fake bake flawless!</li>
            <li>I find myself correcting areas constantly with this tanner, which makes me use more of the product; meaning it will run out soon which is also displeasing.</li>
            <li>mo2MTW5LWRU7DPF]]My take on Fake Bake Flawless Self Tanning</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought a self tanner</li>
            <li>Since this item can&#x27;t be returned I am willing to try it again..</li>
            <li>If it goes any differently I will make sure to update my review.</li>
            <li>i went ahead and ordered it, and it works exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove.</li>
            <li>the tanner made my acne scars stand out more when i initially applied it.it</li>
            <li>It looks real and it doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>(I shaved and exfoliated first.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a much cheaper and safer alternative to tanning, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>THE BEST fake tanner out there.</li>
            <li>I use lotion first, so it&#x27;s blends in with the skin easier.</li>
            <li>First, it gives you an insta-tan.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, i buy it religiously!</li>
            <li>I love the final color.</li>
            <li>, it helped enormously in making sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the flawless results.</li>
            <li>I will give one pointer, the first two times i used it</li>
            <li>No fake tan smell at all.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on, my husband came into the room and said, &amp;#34;do my legs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Just have to be consistent about putting it on or it will wash away in days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty translucent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty brown, not orange.</li>
            <li>I am having more difficulty getting even coverage on my legs, but I suspect that I&#x27;m not using enough</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my mother who has now purchased her first bottle</li>
            <li>I purchased Fake Bake Flawless about a week ago off Amazon and just received it yesterday.</li>
            <li>The tan is gradual yet you can def see after the first application....</li>
            <li>It may look streaky after you first apply it</li>
            <li>So this is my first self tanner I have ever purchased and used.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally tried this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product makes you instantly darker so you can see where you would need more spray.</li>
            <li>Girls, if you wear you hair up, make sure to apply this to the sides and back of your neck and outsides of ears!  </li>
            <li>For the first 2 hours, it smelled like it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>Now, when I say &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34;, self tanners aren&#x27;t exactly rocket science</li>
            <li>The first  time i used it</li>
            <li>Fake Bake&#x27;d Flawless helps me achieve that.</li>
            <li>Like it better than my home air brush system actually faster.</li>
            <li>Everything I wanted, fake bake flawless is my go to self tan.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>the first one got there with no problem at all .  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well...</li>
            <li>After first shower, it was patchy in some areas, but that could have been my fault for how I applied it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best fake tan I think I have ever used</li>
            <li>The mitt that&#x27;s included seems to glide the spray lotion into your skin with ease and you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>THEY PROMISED, LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE PICTURE</li>
            <li>My husband even helped with my back to make sure I got everything even and non streaky.</li>
            <li>While buffing on this tanner, I get an instant shade of tan, with a sun-kissed blush color on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order the bottle without the mitt this time because the one I got first is holding up.</li>
            <li>I thought, Okay keep an open mind, you still haven&#x27;t showered yet maybe the smell will go away.</li>
            <li>I exercise every day which only makes the smell come out more.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a darker color or you have darker skin I would suggest  skipping this and using the Flawless Darker version of Fake Bake.</li>
            <li>This is the only self tanner I use after trying so many.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless...</li>
            <li>it gives you the perfect glow without the look of a fake tan.</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m not sorry I purchase this &amp; will use the remainder of it, yet I don&#x27;t think I will order again.i</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about using this, as with most spray tan products, it kinda gives you a musty scent under your arms.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was some freaky skin problem, but it was just the self tanner.</li>
            <li>No weird splotches.</li>
            <li>Smells like a hot island babe.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li>Dries incredibly fast as well!</li>
            <li>If you follow the suggestions in the first review it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>First tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used nap</li>
            <li>most of it washes out the next shower.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever used that did not turn me orange.</li>
            <li>This is the best fake tan I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Also has a more yellow look than I like.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning product.  </li>
            <li>love the tan it gives but if you  dont have anyone to help you get the back</li>
            <li>Also, just so you always have everything at hand , make sure you have extra latex gloves.</li>
            <li>Still the best fake tan out there.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get a tan instantly with this product.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I have been applying about once a week</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really picky!</li>
            <li>This fake bake is the best solution!</li>
            <li>I have used many and this is the first and only one that does&#x27;t leave an orangey color.  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>(mine was done after the first application)</li>
            <li>Goes on fantastically, but has too much of an orange tint!</li>
            <li>pretty reg from now on.  </li>
            <li>You can see exactly where it is</li>
            <li>I have tried this product many different times, and attempted to apply it in many different ways....</li>
            <li>No streaks and a believable color on my blonde skin.</li>
            <li>You will need to exfoliate your skin first to prepare for your tanning experience.</li>
            <li>I use a towel on my bed the first night</li>
            <li>* a lot comes off the first time you shower.</li>
            <li>I have a light beige skin tone and after just one application I could see i considerable difference in skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best for the price.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I decided to try the one from amazon seller first....</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m glad I bought it the second day of using this</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It feels that part of it goes away when you take the first shower.</li>
            <li>so it was even more so obvious for</li>
            <li>This product left me a bit orange but not horribly.</li>
            <li>However, it was the first self-tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty soup (AKA: DHA).</li>
            <li>It really makes you look tan and not orange at all!</li>
            <li>It can be streaky if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing the first time you are applying it</li>
            <li>Yes, it tans you pretty well with one application.</li>
            <li>Most of color washes off in the Shower next day.</li>
            <li>This really boosted my confidence!</li>
            <li>I showered the next morning, and most of it washed off, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a more greenish undertone and this looked kinda red,</li>
            <li>Okay, people I have been using self tanner on and off since middle school</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t look fake or orange and smells great!</li>
            <li>I convinced my bf to let me give him his first tan.</li>
            <li>It goes on even and fades pretty evenly too which i like</li>
            <li>The application is pretty foolproof and the mitt allows for an even covering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enter my discovery of Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange.</li>
            <li>I would apply first thing in the morning and shower it off before bed</li>
            <li>My first one I didn&#x27;t trim and it resulted in it leaking around the edge...</li>
            <li>and I plan to double team myself with this product and that one in hopes I&#x27;ll have a more stable tan</li>
            <li>and I plan to double team myself with this product and that one in hopes I&#x27;ll have a more stable tan</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product through my hair dresser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so I am very white</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in a while that I&#x27;ve used a self tanning product.</li>
            <li>I did find the smell to linger about for a day or so even after my first morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was expecting the excess colour to wash off in the shower the first time after applying it, so that wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me.</li>
            <li>What I did, because I totally freaked out the first time I seen it, was apply some more baby oil to those areas and blended it with the rest of the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it caused my legs to break out, which many tanning lotions do to my legs.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many various products while others streak and look orange</li>
            <li>I now am confident to take on summer with any outfit (especially my bikini)!</li>
            <li>I spray directly onto my skin and smooth in with the mitt for</li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic if you want an instant tan</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of self tanning products.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>It works well but make sure you have a day or so before going in public.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update with overall body review: Okay-</li>
            <li>First of all, it is a spray need</li>
            <li>If you are wondering if this product does what it says, I can tell you that it absolutely does 100%!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I wasn&#x27;t orange.</li>
            <li>(like I did the first time) and use 2 ziplock bags &amp; an additional plastic bag over the two ziplock,</li>
            <li>As an avid tanner, I&#x27;ve tried everything from tanning booths to spray tans to self tanners.</li>
            <li>BEST fake tanner around.</li>
            <li>im almost done with my first bottle of this</li>
            <li>but I just need to get that death glow off my legs when I first wear skirts without stockings in the spring.</li>
            <li>I just got my fake bake flawless today.</li>
            <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t aware.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>In just two days I&#x27;ve gone from pasty white to a respectable (i.e., not a vampire) color, and there&#x27;s been no streaking or uneveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure that you shower, don&#x27;t take a bath after set hours after becuase you will rinse off the extra.</li>
            <li>I literally had to apply it consistently to get the desired color.</li>
            <li>I WOULD FOLLOW BOX DIRECTIONS AND EXFOLIATE FIRST AND SHOWER</li>
            <li>FIRST</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to absolutely anyone!</li>
            <li>I decided to try something else because the Cali Tan Spray is more like a bronzing last minute spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I opened package to the Fake Bake Flawless, I remember reading a review about it regarding snipping the end of the spray tube that goes inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looked streaky when I first applied it</li>
            <li>If you properly prepare your skin, exfoliate and shave, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best Fake tan product on the market.</li>
            <li>And between you and me, my boss is kinda hot.</li>
            <li>No weird smell.  </li>
            <li>I also have washed the mitt after each use to prolong the life of it &amp; to keep it soft so the spray continues to go on streak free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and have LOVED it..</li>
            <li>but a beautiful golden tan stays behind.</li>
            <li>few streaks, good coverage and tan color not orange.</li>
            <li>-The color is good, IF you plan to apply it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and always have had trouble tanning in beds.  </li>
            <li>If you should end up with some areas darker than others, just exfoliate those spots rather heavily and they will blend in fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just a little bit so the product can flow more easily.</li>
            <li>Follow other reviews, be sure to shower first and do application in the shower for clean up.  </li>
            <li>There is no bending in odd angles naked in the shower while a very very good friend spray paints your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading numerous reviews and watching a half dozen tutorial videos on youtube, I decided to try this for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with Fake Bake products for years now, but this new formula is by far their best yet!!</li>
            <li>If you need a quick, effortless than I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>-I found it easy to apply, but you have to work fast and have a light hand,with long movements and circular ones too;&lt;br /&gt;-have</li>
            <li>Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I looked around on the internet for hours before I finally decided to pick up the Fake Bake Flawless, and I so far really love it!</li>
            <li>The girl that demonstrated it on youtube was quite pale and she turned a gorgeous tan</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m so pale, I can put one application on and I&#x27;m good to go for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product if you are ridiculously pale like I am.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, using the color guard to show you where it has been applied, and provides an instant golden tan.</li>
            <li>My only beef is that the mitt pills quickly, but I guess this isn&#x27;t a huge deal since one comes with every box</li>
            <li>but I have super white light skin</li>
            <li>The first is- the smell after it settles isn&#x27;t pleasant (baked skin smell), but I can get past it.</li>
            <li>The mitt is very nice to have too, as gloves can be hard to work with...</li>
            <li>--I ended up spraying the product directly onto my skin and THEN using the mit to rub it in!!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it really is streak free &amp; smells way better than other self tanners .</li>
            <li>The bronzer is really helpful during application, and washes right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, just my experiences- but I always try to be fair and plain spoken in all my reviews.</li>
            <li>I worked out today and scrubbed the bathroom with cleaners and showered again still dark super easy awsome color !</li>
            <li>Never ever have I gotten such amazing brown natural color!</li>
            <li>Ive used A LOT of different tanners, and this by FAR is my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is the most realistic, easiest to use, best-smelling fake tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless leaves me with a nice, natural looking tan, especially with the mitten that comes with it</li>
            <li>It dries instantly so its not messy at all, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, and it smells nice like coconut sunblock not gross like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>luckily, touch-ups are not hard with this</li>
            <li>This product is different - you are actually getting nice brown tan right away after applying !</li>
            <li>Caution for older women, makes your age spots more apparent.</li>
            <li>True, but I am getting older and want to try to protect my skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews are for real!  </li>
            <li>I purchased fake bake flawless in order to get tanned up for a large formal event I had to attend.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want a football shaped outline on your cheeks when you bend over :)  Same for large breasts, use a cotton bra that fits all the way in under the breast to absorb any sweating.           </li>
            <li>This product lasts a week without applying more before I start to see it fading in certain areas by my inner arm.</li>
            <li>This gives a very natural color with no stains on hands/fingers and dries super fast!</li>
            <li>This product will also significantly darken scars and acne, so I recommend somehow maintaining a reasonably clear complexion while using this on your skin.</li>
            <li>that just gets better as the hours go on, and it&#x27;s build-able depending on how dark you wanna go (I find two days in a row of application is a medium-dark tan)&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing for a self tanner, very similar to coconut tanning oil</li>
            <li>I have them for other purposes since I tint &amp; highlight my own hair.</li>
            <li>but other then that, does give you a nice glow</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too, not like other self tanners.</li>
            <li>Is much lighter than the original and takes several days to achieve what the original does in one.</li>
            <li>The tan is just warm enough, just cool enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the most part, however it takes a while to blend in because spraying onto the mit then onto the skin is a tedious process.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to a friend, but only if they weren&#x27;t willing to spend the extra $20 for the St. Tropez tanner, which I believe is definitely superior.</li>
            <li>but so far the color looks ok and pretty natural.</li>
            <li>On the first try I was even able to get my whole back</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so when I found this product I was excited.</li>
            <li>To be honest I was nervous buying this product because all the other self tanners were in aerosol cans</li>
            <li>The color is nice but that odor , like other self-tanners, lingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also smells much better than most tanners when putting it on, at least at first.</li>
            <li>The nice, deeper color I had hoped for, after using the other product.  </li>
            <li>I always had a hard time tanning my inner arm and this works great!!  </li>
            <li>I have very pale skin, and this gives beautiful, very natural color to even the palest girl.  </li>
            <li>I waited until the next evening to shower, even though it says you only need to wait 4-6 hrs, and after i showered, I was a streaked mess and most of the beautiful color was gone.</li>
            <li>color guard makes sure you don&#x27;t mess up.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great for the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to the original formula again!</li>
            <li>Super natural, a nice bronze color as if I live on a tropical island and spend all day outside!</li>
            <li>I advise washing the mug frequently, otherwise you will turn green lol</li>
            <li>It goes on so well, color is great and subtle.</li>
            <li>As a middle aged man, the combo looks great with my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li>As a middle aged man, the combo looks great with my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li>If you are sure to cover all skin area when applying (don&#x27;t be afraid to repeat over an area) you&#x27;ll have great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them, and I haven&#x27;t been 100% happy with any of them...until now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it worked really amazing, and just after one night.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It really went on smooth and looked so natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to see where you need to apply more as there is a darker guide color that gradually sinks in for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>even when NOT in use all over the box, i had to put toilet paper on the top so that it doesnt bleed out when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But even though I applied it before bed so that it had a chance to thorougly dry most of it washed off, but enough color was added to make it worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I dont know how dark this would be on super pake skin, but I would for sure stick to 60 minutes at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head who has had melanoma, so I use 70spf daily.</li>
            <li>I bought this product last year in the summer, and it worked really well, but you had to be sure diligent on application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the mitt that comes with this stuff to make for a smooth application, or if it&#x27;s the product or both, but the color is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t smell chemically after it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li>The absolute best fake tan spray or cream  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless really is error proof.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely zero complaints regarding this Fake Bake Flawless product</li>
            <li>I really like Fake Bake because the color is perfect for me</li>
            <li>I have tried many different tanners and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned, and have tried many different types of sunless tanners over the years (sprays, creams, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s really not that strong but over time your nose doesn&#x27;t want anything to do with it, and on top of that you can&#x27;t shower because it washes completely</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews before purchasing this product, but I am not impressed with this.</li>
            <li>but it works really well for me &amp; goes on sheer &amp; the more</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such a better color, it&#x27;s sooo much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, the smell is nice, but Fake Bake &amp;#34;Flawless,&amp;#34; it seems, is inherently flawed:&lt;br /&gt;A)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tanning beds off and on during the summer time for a good 8 years, I am only 28 and was recently diagnosed with Melanoma.</li>
            <li>Thats the only way to make sure you havent missed any spots or applied too much in one area.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough (especially with no smell!).</li>
            <li>I got this after trying several different things including the Tan Towel (which I did not like) - I loved this after</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better for someone who already has some color and just wants an extra boost.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is more of a \\&quot;builder\\&quot; fake tan, which is really good for anyone of any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I am selling my tanning bed since I&#x27;m starting to get nervous about melanoma cancer.</li>
            <li>This is only my second self-tanner I have used but color wise</li>
            <li>Truthfully, when I opened the package I was really nervous if the bottle would have been open and used.</li>
            <li>I alternate this with the Jergen&#x27;s daily tanner since this isn&#x27;t a good &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake Flawless before, but ordered it at amazon from this seller because it is so much cheaper compared to Ulta $25+.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought my 2nd bottle because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>following the proven instructions to apply self tanner (Shower, Exfoliate, Moisturize) I found it to be quite a simple process that had good</li>
            <li>I researched this product along with a few others and I decided I wanted a self tanner that would be fast drying and smell good</li>
            <li>am buying more next week and be ready for summer.</li>
            <li>Gives a good natural color only problem is it&#x27;s very sensitive to water and</li>
            <li>The first suggestion of trimming the dip tube was smart and also cleaning the mitt after each use.  </li>
            <li>If you are careful and follow the instructions it is very easy and</li>
            <li>This is very dark stuff and when sprayed it was quite surprised that it more splattered from the bottle than sprayed in a fine mist!</li>
            <li>And it darkened over the next few hours and just looked better and better!</li>
            <li>the color was great and natural looking, but I followed the directions exactly (even left extra drying time) and put it on at night, as directed.</li>
            <li>I now have a scar on my chest, less than cute!</li>
            <li>Also, did not break out my super sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I love the mitt that comes with it because it really provides a smooth application, not to mention it really cut down on the amount of time that it took me to apply.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use a self tanner to try and be a little bit more healthy.</li>
            <li>One coat gave me a good non-artificial look (no orange color) and I used very little of the product.</li>
            <li>hardly no color!!</li>
            <li>and I am super dark, LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Application is easy although I am weary of how long the mitt will be useful.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate your body to get rid of dry spots, and you&#x27;ll be looking beach ready!</li>
            <li>Have only used it once but seems to go pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>Color is very natural and there is no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>One thing that is definitely positive though is that you get color immediately and it lasts for a couple days, if you don&#x27;t reapply.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>/&gt;Believe the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>On a positive note I don&#x27;t even like coconut</li>
            <li>Read another positive review with suggestions to counter others complaints.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks more natural than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Hence the reason the directions say spray at night and take a (VERY LIGHT) shower in the morning and pat, NOT RUB, yourself dry.  </li>
            <li>The mitt makes for easy application and washes out easily with a little baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>At least try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>The color is great, lasts only a few days, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, dries fast, smells great and lasts even after showering a few times.</li>
            <li>I recommend starting out with a light application and adding more the next day if a darker color is desired.</li>
            <li>Not too much color once you shower but still a pretty glow.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use Fake Bake, as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>It is always better to have it too long than too short.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever using a self tanning product (or before a spray tan)</li>
            <li>Due to turning 39 and the effects of tanning becoming more noticeable on my face and chest at an ever increasing speed, every year I spend a few hundred dollars buying all the number one, two and three top brands on the review lists.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying the version made for face next, although so far I&#x27;m happy with this product overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying the version made for face next, although so far I&#x27;m happy with this product overall.</li>
            <li>worry about staining clothes, it washes out of any clothes you may get this on if you aren&#x27;t able to shower (or choose not to if you want to keep the bronzer on for a stronger tanned look, which I recommend as long as it&#x27;s within controlled temperatures).&lt;br /&gt;Unlike St. Tropez</li>
            <li>It washes off pretty fast too.  </li>
            <li>I started with the Original Fake Bake Lotion and just recently bought my first bottle of Flawless.</li>
            <li>(it really is that fast!), and sleep on a towelovernight.</li>
            <li>It will stay on after showering for the most part as long as you don&#x27;t scrub yourself too vigorously.</li>
            <li>The weather has turned warm and my ghostly white legs were just not ready to see the light of day</li>
            <li>My first experience with a self tanner was a St. Tropez gradual tanning lotion that I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>but I am OK with this one as long as I wait a day after I shave.</li>
            <li>The mitt is okay, it&#x27;s starting to fall apart on me, but I feel like that&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li>but the tan pretty much fades in a week.  </li>
            <li>(make sure to leave on as long as they suggest)</li>
            <li>I lastly lightly rub mitt on the top only of my hands without any extra spray.</li>
            <li>The rest of it is pretty much self explanatory.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much anything out there.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that I will add to my long term routine for sure.</li>
            <li>[...] Be careful if you do this in the morning fresh out of the shower, because wearing the color guard all day can get messed up when doing things like dishes, hanging wet laundry, or if you end up getting rained on lol.</li>
            <li>and I was very hesitant about it since this was my first foray into self-tanning.</li>
            <li>Also it pretty much washed off in the shower, which I took 14 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>will be using this for as long as it is made :)</li>
            <li>Mostly I feel as though I should wear a sign saying &amp;#34;Fake tan here.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve long since stopped sunning myself, and tanning beds are not safe-so what to do?</li>
            <li>it looks like a real tan not a fake one..</li>
            <li>At first when I applied it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but as time passed I could see it getting darker.</li>
            <li>It pretty much washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>First of all, the package arrived amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>but I recommend doing your face first before too much product soaks into the mitt.</li>
            <li>There is a review (voted most Helpfil) which I won&#x27;t rehash.</li>
            <li>When applying this you can see exactly what it looks like and rinse off excess color if you have applied to much.</li>
            <li>Not as much upkeep as other tanners which is nice.</li>
            <li>Make sure you trim the spray tube so it isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li>The dark side of the application mit kind of holds the product and it doesn&#x27;t come through onto your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Wash</li>
            <li>It will give you a nice, dark color</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re nice and dark.</li>
            <li>The only issue is you need to really buff it in good for a solid all over color.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I have loved this product in the past.</li>
            <li>just one bit of advice if you have scars, scrapes or any kind of marks on your skin the dark spray will set in and illuminate these flaws on your skin.</li>
            <li>For a comparison, I changed my makeup 2 shades darker than I would usually wear (I&#x27;m fair skinned).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t streak, not at all orange, nice dark brown color.</li>
            <li>use a balm of some kind on ankles, wrists, knees and elbows to blend in and prevent areas from getting too dark or blotchy.  </li>
            <li>The color is a gorgeous brown instead of orangey like spray tans usually come out.</li>
            <li>No orange tinge just a nice tan that you can build up to as dark as you want.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it was as good as the 2 I&#x27;ve used in the past that have both disappeared from the market.  </li>
            <li>It gives my pale skin the most natural looking tan I have been able to acheive from a bottle.</li>
            <li>I just used a rough washcloth and rubbed the heck out of my legs, knees and feet until I was smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>and I had always thought it was pretty decent, even though it was the first tanning cream I used I always stuck with it.</li>
            <li>, pleasant scent and dry time is instant.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something middle of the road that was a decent price and might have better results than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li>mitt is very soft, I think that the brown side works best for rubbing in the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Fake Bake formula does blend very nicely, it does not appear &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; (isn&#x27;t orange, at least on my skin) and it is even (not splotchy).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Other then that I really love this stuff, the smell is really good with little to no self tanner smell afterwards and I have been using this on my face with no breakouts or irritation</li>
            <li>It really has everything I have been looking for: the color is by far the most natural and long-lasting and easy to build on; the scent is very nice, and the DHA does net ever smell super strong as your color develops--and the DHA smell is completely gone once you take your shower;  the product is super easy to apply and very forgiving (I&#x27;m a clutz) and this kit comes with 2 latex gloves to protect your hands and an application mitt that completely and easily gets rid of all streaks; and 2 units of this size bottle lasts me the entire bikini season (which is LONG in Georgia- at least 5 months!); it also works extremely well on my face without causing any breakouts (Just use it more sparingly on your face.</li>
            <li>It by far had the best color I had ever used, but was somewhat difficult and time consuming to get right.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and definitely gives you a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice at first, but after a while smells a little.  </li>
            <li>Use this one day before you want full color (although some color appears immediately and a little more within an hour).</li>
            <li>no need for a gradual tan unless you wana be super dark, one coat is good enough.</li>
            <li>Comes out like new and allows you to continually apply the smoothest streak/splotch free tan every time, even with an old mitt!</li>
            <li>Overall Fake Bake Flawless has even coverage, is easy to use and has decent color payoff.</li>
            <li>i spent my 20&#x27;s getting as much sun as possible, but it seems like more and more people I know are getting skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>I only prefer the high end products, they just tend to be better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame, since I don&#x27;t have much need to look tan for only three days every two weeks and going from fair to tan to fair rapidly looks weird.</li>
            <li>It will probably last me a month,  the other that I use would last about 2 weeks which I had to keep applying every day, which did not smell good !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, the tan lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly like my skin would normally turn after tanning!</li>
            <li>FB is significantly changes my skin tone for the better, but it doesn&#x60;t last for me for a week - unless you don&#x27;t use shower regularly every day,&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was totally worth it and as a fairly new mom this is just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazingly tropical and never turns into that yucky typical self tanner</li>
            <li>Not messy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but I just make sure to apply in shower after i dry off and then wash my hands thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I do lotion up with Lubriderm and make sure Im dry before applying.</li>
            <li>I make sure to rinse out the applicator mitt every time I use it and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>Very decent product.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the application easy</li>
            <li>But I left it on for 6 hours than took a shower and all of the dark washed off leaving me with a great color.   </li>
            <li>NO orange, NO streaking, go as dark as you like, doesn&#x27;t wash off for several days, smells great</li>
            <li>and I leave it sit out on top of my bottle to air dry.</li>
            <li>And it fades far to quickly.</li>
            <li>Itis as easy as drying your skin off with a towel, only you&#x27;re applying tan.</li>
            <li>Definitely idiot-proof and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hey this stuff works great and unlike some I have seen leaving white and dark streaks</li>
            <li>if i don&#x27;t use mass amounts of lotion; i still put lotion on, which seemed to even the bronzer out that would&#x27;ve been washed off if i had chosen to shower, and the blotchy pieces of dry skin blended in more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously if you have dry skin, expect to look a bit blotchy after showering or exfoliating, but I&#x27;ve been able to remedy that by popping a bit tanner into my lotion that I use post-shower when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>Before applying this, be sure to rub some lotion on any dry areas..</li>
            <li>It is easy to see why this product has such rave reviews.</li>
            <li>The color is very realistic as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my entire body, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Very realistic and buildable color.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I used artificial tan, but it turned out flawless.</li>
            <li>Terrific product, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure dry skin areas are moisturized.  </li>
            <li>a medium skinned gal who tans easily but for some mysterious reason my legs take forever to darken.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tans quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I watched several YouTube videos of how to apply and it was easy.</li>
            <li>and I burn easily when I&#x27;m outside but never seem to get tan.</li>
            <li>I burn easily when I&#x27;m out in the sun and living in the deep South</li>
            <li>(make sure you let the product dry a bit before putting on your clothes).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such an easy application</li>
            <li>Not orange, not medium or dark brown, but a smooth radiant light tan glow.</li>
            <li>make sure to let it dry all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>It is easier and less greasy to apply and the glove is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>(I have all white sheets in my bed and no stains!!!), and streaks are fairly easily avoided.</li>
            <li>I spray it directly on my skin and then quickly rub it in with the mit.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have dry patches that will absorb more of the tanning product then the rest of your skin.</li>
            <li>I will use a blowdryer on my body to make sure I&#x27;m thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>The mitten will last longer, and this is an easy way to also wash the product off your hands.</li>
            <li>This goes on pretty light but definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It goes on SO easy, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, or gross !</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, especially with the included mitt, literally takes 5 minutes out of your day.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d just apply more when it was dry and see if it would even out.</li>
            <li>it dries very quickly and i havent noticed any on my clothing from last night or today.</li>
            <li>I had no streaks at all, make sure you don&#x27;t get wet or sweat within the first couple hours of using it</li>
            <li>My acne and dry skin has gotten better but for the life of me I can&#x27;t get even 2 shades darker from tanning.</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice- doesn&#x27;t stink like typical self tanners.</li>
            <li>No streaks, drys quickly, and natural color.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to always exfoliate and dry your legs before you apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no drying time necessary.</li>
            <li>I am on medication that makes me super sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not have dry skin before application otherwise the &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34;  will turn darker.</li>
            <li>Also make sure it&#x27;s dry before getting in bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin as well</li>
            <li>The smell is okay not terrible but not necessarily good either....</li>
            <li>However, it may seem like the application is easy enough, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>(very realistic tan/ not orange at all)</li>
            <li>As I rubbed it on, it went on smoothly, but where it first touched my skin, it left a splotchy mark that I couldn&#x27;t get evened out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After smoothing it on as evenly as I could, it was dry as most people have stated, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>the color is natural and it dries quickly</li>
            <li>Within a day my face is back to the normal tone, so I have to add more.</li>
            <li>It has a great deep dark color, it applies evenly depending on how well you exfoliate your skin etc.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>However, since you rinse this kind off after you apply it, I&#x27;ve noticed it comes off on the clothes a lot less than others do.</li>
            <li>This product has really good color but does not last long (3-4 days).</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product, but I don&#x27;t know if it is much better than the Banana Boat Summer Color self tanning lotion that you can find for half the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li>It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and most importantly: it gives you a beautiful (not orange) tan.</li>
            <li>sure that you have smooth skin when applying- shave and make sure you are careful around the eyebrows, or if you have facial hair take care of it a couple day earlier;&lt;br /&gt;Practice and accept the possible results!</li>
            <li>I liked it, but it was so messy and was all over my clothes until I took that first shower.</li>
            <li>I am very fair completed &amp; have used this 5 out of the past 6 nights but still don&#x27;t have the golden tan on my legs that I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white as a ghost by this April and have to fly down to Miami for a bachelorette weekend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, the second ingredient, Dimethyl Isosorbide, is an extremely great ingredient used in the cosmetics industry because it breaks down surface fat molecules and &amp;#34;hitches a ride&amp;#34; into the living layers of the skin, carrying with it whatever molecule the manufacturer has bound to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color guard in combination with the mitt makes sure I get every single square inch of my body, no streaks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to risk it on my face in case it accentuates any large pores.</li>
            <li>A large portion of it does wash off every time you shower</li>
            <li>I worked at a large chain tanning salon</li>
            <li>if you get sweaty with it on, it will come off on your clothes for certain.</li>
            <li>Would collect in certain areAs.</li>
            <li>Be smart with what will cause sweat WITH FRICTION.</li>
            <li>certain areas lighter and/or darker</li>
            <li>It certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>or when I wear certain tan-only colors</li>
            <li>I feel like I was really misled by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am a very pale person, but this still gave me a good color without looking overly tan.</li>
            <li>As a naturally very pale person, I&#x27;m always looking for a good self tanner.</li>
            <li>I have moderately pale skin, I can tan in the summers but never get extremely dark, and this color comes out perfectly on me.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to self tanner!!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m a new faithful!!</li>
            <li>Ok first the negative it does have a tanning smell about 4 hours into it and once rinsed off its light</li>
            <li>Has a great natural color, buildable, doesn&#x27;t fade weird (hardly actually), and so quick and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product, it just makes a mess in my shower area but</li>
            <li>I even think the color is better than any spray-tan I&#x27;ve had in past, more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time fake tanner with fair to light skin.</li>
            <li>and it eventually came off unevenly and made my skin look even more splotchy!</li>
            <li>This is not my first fake tanner-  but by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I still have a few more applications to go!  </li>
            <li>The color is so natural and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Great as far as not staining clothes, but a little tricky when you&#x27;re new to applying.</li>
            <li>great going on, but next day before shower I detected some odd scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, you get instant color and about half of it stays after a shower.</li>
            <li>The whole process took less time than it would have taken to drive to the tanning salon and get a spray tan, and I did it in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li>Works really nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to put it on, dry and go to bed without worry about it coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I initially tried this product on my legs because I wanted to make sure I got the technique down before I moved to more visible areas of my body.  </li>
            <li>The mitt makes applying this soo fast and easy, especially once you&#x27;ve already done it before.</li>
            <li>It dried in minutes, and I was able to dress quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for a quick fake tan.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have that fake tanner stench, no streaks, easy to use, and good color.</li>
            <li>I suppose it does if you use the stuff, but wash it out, place it over the bottle to dry, it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.</li>
            <li>Third, I have to put on so much because the spray does not spread easily.</li>
            <li>Used to spending wayyy too much time in a tanning bed (lay down AND stand up in same session) to achieve a great tan.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands, both high and low end, and this is the easiest to apply and most natural looking of them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly with absolutely no</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first since self tanner is a scary thing, but it really did go on flawlessly and looked totally natural.</li>
            <li>sprayed the mitt once or twice and began rubbing in very light circles, moving from one area to another while applying harder pressure as the wet/dampness wore off.</li>
            <li>: This is my personal step that really helps me as an extremely pale person get a beautiful, even, brown tan.</li>
            <li>good tip that I found if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you get your back is to spray some of the tanning liquid onto a dark rag/towel and as if you were drying your back off, with one hand hold the top of the towel and one hand hold the bottom, wiping the towel across your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray dried in seconds and leaves a very pleasant smell (considering some of the other ones out there).</li>
            <li>It is a good product and went on very easily, no streaks, and not orange at all.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d rather use the NEW Jergens glow which is completely unscented and achieves a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with the mitt and it has held up fine after numerous applications.</li>
            <li>I have tried every expensive brand from Sephora; Dior, Clinique, St. Tropez and this is the best one by far!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to moisturize dry spots!</li>
            <li>keep it in a cool shelf away from heat and light, where i keep all my other liquid products and lotions without a problem for years.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless saves me nearly $60 a month!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother with &amp;#34;blending lotion&amp;#34;, regular lotion worked just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sticky at all, sinks in super fast, and a light tropical scent.</li>
            <li>And though the company does make a specific product for the face, I used the body tanner and it was totally fine.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li>She has purchased this twice and the look is pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>If you can get it on even the first time, it does have a decent color, but it is a pain to work</li>
            <li>The product also has a decent scent!  </li>
            <li>I would likely buy this again for a quick tanner!</li>
            <li>At this point, I had very high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a very high quality, there are no streaks.</li>
            <li>The mitt that comes with it is also very high quality.</li>
            <li>I think all self-tanners do to a certain extent, but this will straight turn your sheets</li>
            <li>I guess its really my fault for having large pores, but still I took a star off my rating for that reason.</li>
            <li>I have tried other self tanners and this one is my favorite by far!!!!</li>
            <li>I love that it also gives a slight tan right after using it, so if you feel like you need a tan</li>
            <li>, little do they know my AMAZING tan comes out of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>the mit that comes with it for application kind of sheds a little.</li>
            <li>applied at night went to bed and woke up nice and dark !</li>
            <li>Especially in the traditional places where the lotions sink in too much and create the ever lovely bread-crust effect on the edges of the palms, between the fingers, nail beds, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the feet!</li>
            <li>The following night, I applied another and that made me kind of orange, so just as a fair warning, if you are super pale, you might come out a little orange.</li>
            <li>I am SUPER pale and it gives me a nice natural tan without all of the damage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to see where you apply it because the colorguard is super dark.  </li>
            <li>Even better is, it did not rub off a single bit on to my clothing!</li>
            <li>but works very good and doesn&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and have a difficult time finding a self-tanner than doesn&#x27;t look orangy and rusty.  </li>
            <li>The applicator sponge is a real pain to use, unless you are doing large area&#x27;s or your whole body, but for my face, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I get the best results when I exfoliate for a few days before using it &amp; the day of, then use it after taking a shower in the evening &amp; putting on NO lotions or anything [except for a little argan oil or something like that on my elbows, knees, ankles and face].</li>
            <li>I have used numerous self tanning products in the past and I can honestly say this one gives the most realistic color of all of them.</li>
            <li>Took a little bit to apply the first time trying to make even, but overall amazing!</li>
            <li>Looks very natural!!  </li>
            <li>With other products, the smell was so strong that it lingered even after showering- not in a powerful way</li>
            <li>my overall body was pretty good not going to lie, but areas like your feet hands knees are super tricky and give the FAKE tan away so easily.</li>
            <li>Okay, usually self tanner is something I would use for special occasions or weekends I wanted to wear shorts.  </li>
            <li>And definitely not orange or muddy looking, but a beautiful slightly darker than your natural shade tan!  </li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased with the ease of the application process, how quickly it dries and though the tan is not intensely dark, it does look natural</li>
            <li>My excitement was so high for this product to only go down more and more as I use the product.</li>
            <li>Have spent $100 and this looks so much more real.</li>
            <li>I also lightly apply an \\&quot;in shower\\&quot; body lotion or oil such as Alph Keri and gently rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I hope the instructions are accurate because it says I only have to apply once a week to keep this tan.  </li>
            <li>By far the best fake tanning solution I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product had amazing reviews, so I figured that many people couldn&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li>It goes on really even, and the mitt smoothes nicely to avoid any harsh, discolored areas.  </li>
            <li>Works great but only feels like the tan stays for a few days instead of a &amp;#34;week&amp;#34; as the box says</li>
            <li>and you can see a huge difference with just one application as my stomach was snow white</li>
            <li>My legs have that pasty &#x27;dead fish, belly up white&#x27;, LOL.  </li>
            <li>This has great lasting power, and my bottle lasted me around 2 months with heavy use.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best fake tanning product I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>I love fake bake products and this was an amazing price for this product.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product was how light it was.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely get a full body spray tan with it, the bottle lasts for a really long time to which is a big plus :) Enjoy</li>
            <li>, I think this is a terrific product and really enjoy the whole line that FakeBake has.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is very buildable, so you can get a light tan or a really deep one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this albino Momma is a HUGE fan of this product and will definitely continue to purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I still really like the results though, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>The picture is very misleading as it shows in the picture a spray nozzle on a purple bottle.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m ready to put on a skirt and head out the door.</li>
            <li>This looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>Thanks Glenis.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviews that stated the gloves that came with it were very flimsy</li>
            <li>An absolute steal</li>
            <li>She is also very slender</li>
            <li>My tan looked a lot better than some of my friend&#x27;s professional spray tans (which cost so much more!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this correctly is key.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll have light spots, especially don&#x27;t sweat or there will be brown rain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>With potential problem areas of the knees and elbows a LIGHT application of baby oil works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li>I have never used a self tanner before and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect</li>
            <li>I was intrigued on trying this out, I happened to find this product out on amazon, by accident really</li>
            <li>This stuff fades really fast.</li>
            <li>, I was hoping for a burst of fruitness or something really tropical</li>
            <li>You have to really put it on 4 days in a row and</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t get splotchy.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>, I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li>My legs never got much color at all.</li>
            <li>Ive really tried every self tanner, creams, gels, lotions, sprays.  </li>
            <li>And reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>It really has everything you hope for in a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t stand out as much in the summer.</li>
            <li>I only use the mit after applying to smooth around ankles and elbows, because I feel like mits end up rubbing off 1/2 of your self tanner</li>
            <li>but this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely re-order</li>
            <li>Oh and I like this much more compared to aerosol sprays because you have to be so careful not to spray them all over the walls.  </li>
            <li>This pump is much easier.  </li>
            <li>My suggestions would be to definitely do it a night, exfoliate before applying, and mostly importantly, take your time when applying this.</li>
            <li>My tan always looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>It gives a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; tan.</li>
            <li>but for the price, you really just can&#x27;t beat this bottle....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much sun in a year</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with a very stained hand.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try it, but they were selling it for almost $30.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic tanning product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me orange and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>Just blend it in very well and DO NOT RUSH THE PROCESS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking people who say it&#x27;s orange are using too much and not spreading it well.</li>
            <li>and I was referred to use this by a pageant girl who models for Modern Vintage Boutique.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>So I was caught and had to tell him what it was haha as soon as we got home from running errands</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So I apply a light coat daily until I get the tan I want.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After exfoliating with a coarse sugar scrub, I applied lotion lightly to my elbows, ankles, toes, knees (</li>
            <li>I am a very fair-skinned redhead with some freckling.</li>
            <li>(I really went for it and put it ALL over).</li>
            <li>I really like the &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Blended really well</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping .</li>
            <li>Thanks again...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much at once.</li>
            <li>Consistency is very water-like.  </li>
            <li>I DO have more color, just not much on my legs.</li>
            <li>I applied this Monday and didn&#x27;t really need to reapply tonight (Friday) but</li>
            <li>By the reviews I expected this to be better than the drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>I did my homework and tried to read as much about how to apply and which ones claim to do the job without making you orange and stinky.</li>
            <li>I use this everywhere, my whole body, hands, feet, and my face as well.</li>
            <li>really its because of this product</li>
            <li>I think the mitt is the real clincher here though.</li>
            <li>I keep looking at my tan bod because I am amazed at how real it looks.</li>
            <li>It gave a really great color, but the spray got all over my floor and cabinets, it was horrible, I went back to the orignial and am very happy.</li>
            <li>you will get a golden, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>put on the gloves and shake the bottle very well.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that wants a tan without the damage!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin imperfections still show through but would with a real tan too.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The mitt makes the application very even and prevents my palms form staining.</li>
            <li>The day it arrived, I showered &amp; exfoliated my whole body.</li>
            <li>, it absolutely does not rub off on clothing etc.  </li>
            <li>It came out very even</li>
            <li>and I was done my whole body in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>No streaking and dries fast.</li>
            <li>but I have a very yellowy-green olive complexion...</li>
            <li>This (both with 1 then 2 applications ) looks fairly natural and golden not orange.</li>
            <li>It looks like a real tan</li>
            <li>I really prefer the lotion because it gets me a darker color.  </li>
            <li>But I like how it dries so fast</li>
            <li>So my wife decided to try it and it has turn out very well for her.</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>I had spray tanned at a salon, but it never compared to the real thing, so</li>
            <li>Use sparingly when squirting it out on the mit, it comes out in an amount which was way too much to use at once.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>Just enough to cover light flaws.</li>
            <li>I expected to use it more</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on my skin</li>
            <li>I feel as though it worked with my skin tone and blended really well.</li>
            <li>how much is needed to evenly distribute onto my whole body.</li>
            <li>But it also fades very evenly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very affordable price.</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>1 for the foot, ankle, knee and back of knee lightly.</li>
            <li>the easier it is to spread around and blend like as in spraying your whole arm, not just your forearm.</li>
            <li>The sun always burns me no matter how much sunscreen I lather on myself.</li>
            <li>I normally just use those scrubbing gloves and it all works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Even though it was fast drying (which means you need to work relatively fast) a lot of the color comes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>They exchanged it no problem (thanks amazon)</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>this is something that you cant put on fast, you need to evenly put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a light tan left on my arms and legs and haven&#x27;t used it in over a week.</li>
            <li>so I shouldn&#x27;t diss it too much.</li>
            <li>This is a much healthier option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t really absorb, but that the liquid stays on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>As a recovered serial tanner, then serial spray tanner, I have to say I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very sunkissed.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than a spray, and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house and get sticky and stinky for a while</li>
            <li>The spray bottle makes applying this so much easier.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This combination works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>As the tan develops the smell will come through, but I don&#x27;t really notice it unless I sniff my arm.</li>
            <li>) Wash the mitt gently with soap and water after each application.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>I really like the spray.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the spray over a gel, liquid or mousse because the spray really soaks in to your skin.</li>
            <li>Can really make some mistakes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It puts such a light color on you that it&#x27;s not even noticeable.</li>
            <li>The color was  very faded and spotty</li>
            <li>(No matter how much exfoliation, it comes off patchy in these areas).</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need to &amp;#34;review&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>very quickly&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product will probably purchase again</li>
            <li>This stuff does work really well for what it is.</li>
            <li>Also MUST exfoliate well beforehand, otherwise it looks very splotchy.</li>
            <li>I can get out of the shower, apply oil to my elbows, then put this on and get ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using this product before bed, but really, there&#x27;s no reason to.</li>
            <li>I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Secondly but equally as important, NO orange.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>The problem with the spray on tan was you had no way of telling how much coverage you had.</li>
            <li>very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Shows a real tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 4 hours I could really see the tan.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I used too much product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>VERY embarrassing...</li>
            <li>The bronzer really does help you to see where you are putting it on, and how much.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and the mitt works very well at evening things out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention it dries insanely fast during application, which is always a plus in my book&lt;</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on self tanners.</li>
            <li>and I seemed really orange-y.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I  really like the color this stuff leaves</li>
            <li>Give it a shot for real.</li>
            <li>MAYBE I NEED A VERY MUISTURIZING BODY CREAM.</li>
            <li>I could not use this on my face as it very drying and got streaky.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If I were simply just hanging out on the beach, it&#x27;s fantastic for giving that tan without the sun damage.</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>but I recently was diagnosed with skin cancer and had to stop tanning in the UV light.</li>
            <li>I also moisturize my skin very well though.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this</li>
            <li>so I got really go results</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend to much time in the sun</li>
            <li>It also is VERY blotchy..</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Because it will absorb into your skin so fast, and you use twice as much.</li>
            <li>So much, I almost wrote this review</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really tan you either.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use because I really did NOT want to be orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the time for real sun (not to mention the damaging rays) or the money for a spray tan.</li>
            <li>It was very orange.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much self tanner</li>
            <li>but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Then applied this to my whole body, face included.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You build the color each day, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too intense.</li>
            <li>You have to work fast with the mitt, because the product dries rapidly.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on you&#x27;ll notice your pours are darker than normal.</li>
            <li>, it looks like a real tan &amp; I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Dries really fast so no rubbing off on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li>I have tried lotions that really had me scared of self tanners</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I wanted to quit wearing pantyhose with dresses and feel comfortable wearing shorts in public.</li>
            <li>I exfoliated before applying and really tried to rub it on evenly.  </li>
            <li>It really soaked into some parts of my legs but not others.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do that</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no streaks and instant color.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>It makes the application process simple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Tan looks real and not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I really like fakebake.</li>
            <li>It tends to come off even after I waited a whole day (or couple.)</li>
            <li>it helps you get it on very evenly.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I have never used a self-tan/sunless tanner before because I feared looking like an orange, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Also do not wear it under light or white clothes.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and doesnt get all over!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>This dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Love this product... works great and does NOT look yellow or fake...</li>
            <li>I really like the mitt</li>
            <li>AT ALL, no matter how much I exfoliate and moisturize afterwards,  I still end up very blotchy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the colour that shows on my skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend people try it!</li>
            <li>I really like how the color looks</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leak THAT much</li>
            <li>Seems like a much safer alternative to going out in the sun and the color of my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>really looks like you went to the islands and sunbathed for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instant results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Too much money and effort to go through for no visable color change.</li>
            <li>then apply lotion to my whole body( Olay)&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>Get put of shower and lotion up your whole body.</li>
            <li>That tells me it looks real, not orange and cakey.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and isn&#x27;t tacky.  </li>
            <li>and I got very tan.</li>
            <li>When it starts to fade in the creases of your arms and around your neck it looks very splotchy.</li>
            <li>it will run, which really bothered me.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well.</li>
            <li>It also is very orange.</li>
            <li>To much orange tint.</li>
            <li>DHA, the tanning agent in products like this is in and of itself NOT HARMFUL really if your not bringing it into your lungs.</li>
            <li>So I took a shower that night, and exfoliated very well, like you are supposed to</li>
            <li>Also, if you use this stuff on your hands/feet, do so very sparingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a porcelain skinned redhead and this product didn&#x27;t deliver much of a tan.</li>
            <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the mitt that comes with it as well.</li>
            <li>All in all, I will keep using it, until I can get some real sun.</li>
            <li>It is important to keep skin regularly moisturized while using this though.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t that much work anyway.</li>
            <li>I refuse to damage and ruin the youthful lipids from UV rays, but I really like a \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; glow form a tan.</li>
            <li>and i want my face as tan as my body without having to color in my whole face and neck with makeup and look all cakey.</li>
            <li>The color guide really does help you see where it went, and also looks passable as a tan until your tan develops.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>The gloves and the mitt really make a difference in the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li>This stuff looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real brown tint.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t give me much of a tan, and what it did give me would fade in about four days.</li>
            <li>Once it washes off it doesnt leave as much tan as I would like</li>
            <li>if you keep re-applying too much.</li>
            <li>It will really transfers onto sheets, but has always washed out.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast so</li>
            <li>There are those that say the mitt uses up too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>so you can really tell where you have applied.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell (coconut).</li>
            <li>my package got here so fast.</li>
            <li>but I already know I&#x27;m going to buy another one here real soon</li>
            <li>Be careful around your arms if you&#x27;re like me and tend to have tanner arms on the top of your forearm and paler skin on the bottom part of your arm/the inside crease of your elbow.</li>
            <li>and you really can&#x27;t do anything that night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not apply too much pressure when rubbing it in the the mitt.</li>
            <li>As for the Fake Bake its amazing, light fresh smell not over powering at all.</li>
            <li>: If you mix in your hands with a body lotion it makes the application THAT much faster and longer</li>
            <li>The amount you put on is what color it turns our to be, it doesnt get much drker as the day goes on, shake up the bottle before use and cut the stem on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is much thinner in consistency</li>
            <li>Also when you stop the tanning treatments and it wears off, it came off much like too-tan skin; flaky and patchy</li>
            <li>its dries so fast.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t rub off on any of my clothes, which is pretty remarkable, considering I actually sprayed some on my arms and back, put on white silk pajamas and went to sleep, and nothing came off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the absolute sh!t.</li>
            <li>It looks real.</li>
            <li>almost white in the winter; but in the summer, I am capable of getting a nice medium deep tan.  </li>
            <li>I have not had much luck with this product.</li>
            <li>It wants to slip off during application.</li>
            <li>It works, it really works...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The color is natural and golden looking and does increase with time and applications.</li>
            <li>I really have to use something on my legs in the summer</li>
            <li>and I really looked like I had a real</li>
            <li>and everyone thought we had real tans from baking on the beach.  </li>
            <li>It smells very tropical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this self tanner.  </li>
            <li>It would take maybe 4 days of application to really see a change</li>
            <li>You need to exfoliate really well to get it all off.</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t really like, I wish it just didn&#x27;t smell at all, so I&#x27;d suggest showering before hanging out with anyone.</li>
            <li>this looks better than any spray tan ive ever had, it looks like i&#x27;ve spent a week on vacay!it</li>
            <li>I dont like how if you put too much on in one place it will be blachy</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re really supposed to drench the thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I:&lt;br /&gt; -exfoliated very well</li>
            <li>, I can now get a natural golden tan without the damage of the sun or tanning bed.</li>
            <li>This stuff washes off to fast</li>
            <li>It goes on well and looks real.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>After which, is still smells but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t do much to keep it on like moisturize or refrain from shaving.</li>
            <li>The mitt that comes with it does need to be washed every couple times you use it, but it washes up really well.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered very promptly and as stated.</li>
            <li>But how natural looking it does look is so worth over-looking that con.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It dried really fast and instantly looks great.</li>
            <li>so I embarrassingly have, for lack of a better word, crevices, where I had a bit of trouble applying, but ultimately was able to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it looks really streaky when I applied it.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a self tanner, instead it is very tropical smelling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>Really helps apply an even color</li>
            <li>Which i dont really see any color come off when i rinse.  </li>
            <li>highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and some of the girls asked if I spent money on a tanning salon spray tan.</li>
            <li>He would never have had me put it on if it didn&#x27;t look real.  </li>
            <li>Mine always washes off, but again, I do like to really exfoliate my body and moisturize my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>It builds very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries amazingly fast and I haven&#x27;t noticed any on my clothing or sheets.</li>
            <li>extra light when you rub across feet, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!nner.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>People think it&#x27;s a real tan on me.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY use a plastic glove under the mitt.</li>
            <li>It really does glow.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color, it is a bit intense though especially if you are wintertime white, it wasn&#x27;t orange</li>
            <li>my real sun tan</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It works really well not to turn you orange while giving you a tan gradually</li>
            <li>Not too much of the color came off.  </li>
            <li>I really like the result from this tanner, doesn&#x27;t fade patchy</li>
            <li>It really needs a wrist banding sewed onto the mitt to keep it from pulling off.</li>
            <li>the mit makes it very convenient, but i did forget to wear the rubber gloves they provide with it</li>
            <li>I have purchased every brand from the very highest end to the lowest.</li>
            <li>Going into it I was VERY scared of turning really orange, messing up, etc.</li>
            <li>I would not spray much on, if I wanted a bronzed look</li>
            <li>This was so much better than I expected having never used a self tanner.</li>
            <li>It is now May 13, and I&#x27;m getting ready to order again to carry us thru summer.</li>
            <li>did watch some videos on how to apply it which were really helpful for getting even color and to avoid streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was home all day because by the time I was ready to take a shower, I stank.</li>
            <li>It is fast drying, and the \\&quot;color\\&quot; won&#x27;t rub off on stuff while you sleep...</li>
            <li>after i scrubbed those babies, my over all tan looked real.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of sunless tanners over the years and was really looking forward to trying this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>(I used it primarily to add color to my upper arms to eliminate a semi-farmers tan).</li>
            <li>stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li>I decided I don&#x27;t like this product so much after all...</li>
            <li>It made me an orangeish color and was very splotchy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>One application doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>hand mit is really helpful to prevent streaking.</li>
            <li>Will make knees and ankles orange if you get too much product on them.  </li>
            <li>You Have To Find Out How Much You Need To Apply For Yourself To Get The Tan You Want .</li>
            <li>In Conclusion , I Really Recommend This Product .</li>
            <li>What really sealed the deal for me with this product is the way it fades.  </li>
            <li>if you get too much to can wash it off &amp; start over.</li>
            <li>FAST</li>
            <li>I used a sea sponge loofah and some sugar scrub I made to exfoliate everywhere, really focusing on my knees, elbows, ankles, hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The mitt doesn&#x27;t stay on my hand very well</li>
            <li>It has saved me so much money (from getting air brush tans)</li>
            <li>I really think that makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>but then I had another friend tell me that I was getting really tan</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Dries fast, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It looks like a REAL TAN.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tanning liquid!</li>
            <li>This product is much easier to apply than the one I used to buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>Works very well on body</li>
            <li>Layers very well.</li>
            <li>...glow in the light white, if I may.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments when I use this, and it looks really natural...even for me.</li>
            <li>Not orange and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast; it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have any on.</li>
            <li>use it after showering before bed, Do not apply too much stay on the lighter side.</li>
            <li>I really like this product-</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Nice product for me who does not have time to spend hours tanning but wants to go outside with friends and not have that totally white glow.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with 2 protective latex gloves, to protect your hands from absorbing to much color, and it also includes an application mitt.  </li>
            <li>If they would attach elastic around the bottom, it would stay on your wrist better, instead of slipping off.  </li>
            <li>This goes on evenly, activates and dries fast, and has NO SMELL.</li>
            <li>(because this stuff dries fast) using the rubber gloves that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I applied the tanner to my whole body, boobs and all, I&#x27;m also a breast feeding mother who co sleeps with my baby.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also very buildable</li>
            <li>The glove that comes with it works very well too.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I used it gently on my face,  hands, elbows , knees.. and just took my time</li>
            <li>For me, it took a lot of coats to really make a difference, but with that said...</li>
            <li>Took me three applications to get the color I wanted on my legs that matched to the real tan</li>
            <li>Has to be to be very evenly put on</li>
            <li>inside of elbow) fade much quicker than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>really getting a tan!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If you put to much on, don&#x27;t worry too much, you can get some of it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Another downside with the mitt is even if you exfoliate really well</li>
            <li>and it looks real.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast too</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to get into this whole Snookie thing.  </li>
            <li>The tan is extreamly even as well as real looking.</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure not to get wet went</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan...not orange.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so much darker</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>this stuff really works..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so dont use to much or</li>
            <li>it looks really streaky.</li>
            <li>banana boat just didn&#x27;t really tan very well at all.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how much that matters, but seems reasonable</li>
            <li>The mit really helps and the spray on.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS TANNER..</li>
            <li>and it really took the pasty-ness away.  </li>
            <li>so I will by from amazon again and again thanks</li>
            <li>DO NOT listen to people saying it doesn&#x27;t wash off immediately because it absolutely does.</li>
            <li>It looks like a real tan; not some Jersey Shore Oompa Loompa monstrosity.</li>
            <li>Could I have rubbed it too much and some of the product rubbed off perhaps??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And highly recommend !</li>
            <li>but the night after I feel much lighter.</li>
            <li>Liquid tanner in a squeeze tube is kind of a mess, and I&#x27;m sure that is why the other products didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li>Much darker color than Moist Hemp Bronzing lotion alone.</li>
            <li>to apply&lt;br /&gt;Looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the pump, and in fact you really dont need to use the pump</li>
            <li>The stuff just looks real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I still do really like this product, but I had to take a star away.  </li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>really though...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t risk having too much on your hands because this is a fast drying product (and trust me</li>
            <li>I tend to get a bit antsy and go too fast over my thighs, but that&#x27;s how you can miss a spot...</li>
            <li>Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When washing your mitt: I use a gentle shampoo to wash it out, and truly scrub it.</li>
            <li>I was a tad afraid to try it, but it worked great!</li>
            <li>Very tropical.</li>
            <li>I really like the application method.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting to the point where it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to keep it up.</li>
            <li>but after showering you have to really look to see it.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t understand how it can fade that much after one wash.</li>
            <li>:/showering you have to really look to see it.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t understand how it can fade that much after one wash.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot</li>
            <li>They never came out even or looked real..</li>
            <li>even the darkest formula didn&#x27;t really build up much color on my skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve battled with the orange thing my whole life.</li>
            <li>I realized that somehow the liquid came out of the bottle &amp; the brown liquid seeped through the bag and completely ruined over $250 worth of clothing &amp;</li>
            <li>you really cant screw up the application unless you just dont wipe that spot...</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li>Also it dries so fast because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li>of my absolute favourite things is that it doesn&#x27;t smell AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried a tanner that didn&#x27;t immediately give off that metallic funk that hung around you until you showered later, even if they promised they were odor free.  </li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product for all complexions.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t end up looking too bronze, either, which I appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I used a light coating of massage oil on my hands, elbows, and knees prior to applying.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>but after an hour or two, ended up looking much lighter.</li>
            <li>The provided glove makes the application so much faster and even.</li>
            <li>With the guide this is the fastest self tanner I have found that provides a very even look.</li>
            <li>i really like this self tanner.</li>
            <li>,THEY MUST BE PUTTING ON  TO MUCH?</li>
            <li>BUT AGAIN I DIDNT USE TO MUCH</li>
            <li>Drys fast.</li>
            <li>when really it was just one application i applied</li>
            <li>I appreciated that the seller was so prompt in sending the order.  </li>
            <li>It applies very well and after drying and letting it soak into my skin it was not streaky at all.</li>
            <li>From the very high-end to the drugstore brand</li>
            <li>It keeps it from absorbing too much into your skin and making it look dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Spray straight on the skin</li>
            <li>It really is all about trial and error.</li>
            <li>I of course didn&#x27;t really understand until I got the bottle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend really exfoliating your skin before applying so</li>
            <li>And it really stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buff lightly onto feet and hands using the buffing mitt only.  </li>
            <li>Haha)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, but the tan really evened itself out over night.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to get out in the sun (nor do i really want to fry myself)</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it fades out waiting a whole week to reapply.</li>
            <li>After not using it for two days a green ring appeared on the brown mitt and it kind of freaked me out.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far and am pleased with the color it provided</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a natural looking fade or last more than 3-4 days</li>
            <li>I LOVE the sun and love being tan, but as we all know, it&#x27;s not great for the skin.</li>
            <li>its ok, I have used some that are way better and some that are way worse.</li>
            <li>I spray it at night, I take a shower the next day to make sure my tan has developed and stays on longer.</li>
            <li>and I was still left with a nicely tanned naked bod.  </li>
            <li>The Fake Bake product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>on nice and even and doesn&#x27;t look fake, it looks like a nice natural tan.</li>
            <li>I applied an hour before bed and found the smell from it on my face overwhelming (I&#x27;m sensitive to odors) and had to get up in the middle of the night to shower.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>I have had people comment on my nice color a few times since I started using this.</li>
            <li>The color is okay, I guess, but it&#x27;s obvious that it isn&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li>like I had some kind of skin disease for a few weeks before it was all gone.</li>
            <li>It seems to rinse off when you shower or bathe so to actually keep a nice glow you have to do it often, if not daily.</li>
            <li>I have used many self-tanners before such as L&#x27;oreal sublime, Jergens Natural Glow, Tan-Towels, Clinique brands, etc.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and the smell is tolerable, but when it started to fade, it looked like dirt on my skin, especially around my feet and inner part of my arms.</li>
            <li>I liked the Fake &amp; Bake lotion better than the spray option, but this product does work well.</li>
            <li>I have never had anyone make a negative remark about the color, all I hear is about how good</li>
            <li>actually gave my 1/4 full bottle to somebody who was interested in trying it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice, even color and makes me not look so dead.</li>
            <li>The mitt is handy for application - that also comes with a few gloves to wear underneath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a stain, leaked all over destroying a nice 32.00 shirt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a firm believer in skin protection while still having a nice sunkissed glow</li>
            <li>After trying several self-tanners, this is by far, the most tolerable.</li>
            <li>I honestly think the tan with Fake Bake looks better than the tan I get from sun/tanning bed.</li>
            <li>just you (which is a good thing, at least in my opinion).</li>
            <li>I recommend doing it right after your shower, use Pure &amp; Natural soap</li>
            <li>I put it on last night and instantly had a nice tan</li>
            <li>Maybe if they had a different kind of mitt to apply it with...say with fingers and different material...</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless gives you a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>which is nice, but again it is messy.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is, by far, the best.  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake works well and gives you a nice, healthy tan.  </li>
            <li>,Such a nice thing to hear when before I felt embarrassed of my white legs.</li>
            <li>I prefer creating my own Fake Bake tan rather than paying for a spray tan; I received better results.</li>
            <li>I have never really been able to use a self tanner due to my skin being dry, but this stuff is outstanding!!</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s not oily, it dries fast, and the color is great even for such pale skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>I use the fake bake flawless at night right before bed after I have already brushed my teeth and done anything else that I need to do that requires using water.</li>
            <li>Not only is it super easy to apply, but the color lasts forever, it doesn&#x27;t wash off streaky like other tanners, it smells AMAZING even after it&#x27;s dry, and speaking of drying, I can get dressed immediately after putting this on without having to worry about it coming off on my clothes.</li>
            <li>, i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s super fair skinned only because i am not sure how it&#x27;d react.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>It just takes a few minutes to apply; you&#x27;ll be able to see a tan right away.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m sure mostly everyone knows this, but I learned this the hard way, is to use a scrub before the first application and apply a little bit of lotion on feet, knees and elbows to make the product go on smoothly to those areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the Fake Bake Flawless over the Sungoddess because Sungoddess seems to dry/bunch up when i&#x27;m applying in some areas, but other then that if i&#x27;m careful and rub in good then no problems.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, little smell, dries super fast.</li>
            <li>First off, you want to make sure you exfoliate with a product that does not leave an oily residue because if you use this after that, it dries in an odd mottled coloring, almost like you have a rash or something.</li>
            <li>elbows and knees, tan over them quickly and smoothly -careful not to have a full mit of product when you touch these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick to apply with the mitt, it only takes me about 3 minutes to do my whole body!</li>
            <li>its easy to use and the smell is not bad, but i think u can still smell it after few days , the colour is not orange , i didnt put on me face tho .</li>
            <li>im scared i would mess up, and look funny or not rub in good enough.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it was easy to apply and dried quickly but was way too light even after several applications.</li>
            <li>Mitt fibers started falling out by the end of the first use, so I bought a new one for 10 bucks from another brand</li>
            <li>After my first application I went downstairs without telling my mom that I tried out my new holy grail (we are beauty fanatics and bffs)</li>
            <li>first off guys if your new to this.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake worked great, had a nice smell to it, easy to apply, lasts fairly long (3-4 days unless you apply every other night) and this doesn&#x27;t stain everything.</li>
            <li>but I live in Alaska right now, so my paleness was becoming alarming.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it directly on the mitt and held the sprayer almost right on it to avoid spraying my  surroundings.</li>
            <li>I am over the days of laying in tanning beds, and right now the weather here does not all to get natural sun.</li>
            <li>Even my 10 yr old daughter came in right after and said &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried AT LEAST 5 other self tanners, this is the best  one BY FAR!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply as long as you shave and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Like so many other reviews state, this works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original fake bake and loved everything but the smell...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li>The balm isn&#x27;t cheap (it was originally priced at $90 but dropped to $50 on Amazon a few weeks</li>
            <li>I have used the original Fake Bake and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Fake Bake lotion and loved it.</li>
            <li>The mitt and gloves provided really help in preventing the streaking and hand-staining that most other sunless tanners cause.</li>
            <li>Other than those avoidable/fixable problems, overall a good product and would recommend.  </li>
            <li>Luckily this self tanner produced and very natural color on my skin, very close to a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the face as splotchy for those people who are older like me who have large pores.</li>
            <li>After exfoliating, I used a few squirts of this (I kept it light for the first application) and I was surprised by how lightly it went on and how well the enclosed glove worked to apply the product evenly.  </li>
            <li>I have very light pale skin naturally with cool undertones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty Irish, and Fake Bake Flawless gives me just the right amount of tan that looks natural and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li>I apply it to dry skin after a good exfoliation in the shower, give it about 2-3 minutes to completely dry</li>
            <li>or maybe my skin is super dry and absorbed the wetness immediately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally light skinned (European decent)</li>
            <li>You can see very clearly where you are applying, and while this is a liquid, it spread and blended incredibly well, dried amazingly fast, and actually left my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I tried this last night after my bath (exfoliated, lotioned my knobby parts, dried myself very well) and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use other self tanners but I love this one ....</li>
            <li>Perfect fake bake with out all the harm of the sun!</li>
            <li>Smell is WAY better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Best fake tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Way better than lotions or other sprays.</li>
            <li>and personally I will only use self-tanners that contain bronzers so that you are clearly able to see exactly where you are applying it.</li>
            <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t have any other self tanners on when applying this.</li>
            <li>it took several days to see a significant tan and to work out any spots where I was heavier or lighter handed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know what I like most, the color or the fact that it doesn&#x27;t sit in your pores on your legs like so many other tanners do, or the other fact that it doesn&#x27;t fade like if you have some sort of disease.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate prior to applying and wash your mitten out in the sink after every use and your golden!</li>
            <li>and I love telling other women</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, none really keep that great bronze post the first shower (but then nor did the $50 salon spray tan either).  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and lingering like some other tanners I have used.</li>
            <li>The following day I noticed that familiar self Tanner smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not beach or water friendly, and tended to run and spot, which led to daily applications at one point.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other spray on tanning formula i have ever used....</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not sticky like many other formulas.</li>
            <li>Way better than the other.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I can not stand the orange color I&#x27;ve gotten from so many other products.</li>
            <li>I have always been on the hunt for a good fake tanner, but up until I found this product I was not able to find one that I was happy with.</li>
            <li>I would say there are two things to be aware of however - the liquid and the mitt require a little more effort in blending than a lotion self-tanner would.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky like most other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>Another thing, my mitt started to pill up on the first use and little pieces come off at each use - hopefully this won&#x27;t happen too much more.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold up better then other sunless tanners I use.</li>
            <li>It does smell better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very big bottle too so well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>i was concerned the color might look to orange like many other self tanners on the market.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint like many other either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two so far its about time to order again!;)</li>
            <li>Despite many other reviews saying to shower at night, apply, let settle/go to sleep, and shower again in the morning...</li>
            <li>instead you could shower in the morning, apply this stuff, and you would have a deep rich tan that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is much better then other tanners.</li>
            <li>So unless you apply 3 or 4 applications on top of each other which I&#x27;m assuming this reviewer may have done, it will NOT turn you orange.</li>
            <li>: Overall I find this product to be worth every cent!</li>
            <li>am a 28 year old female with pretty light skin (daywalker here).</li>
            <li>I cut a bit more than an inch off of the straw part as recommended in other reviews to prevent the leaking.  </li>
            <li>Smell is better than other drug store brands that I&#x27;ve tried - although there is an eventual tanning product smell after using.</li>
            <li>Most of the other sunless products that I have used, turn my skin a blotchy brown, orange color.</li>
            <li>The best fake tan ever !</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I got several bottles for myself and others.  </li>
            <li>THOUGH like most other self tanners.</li>
            <li>I followed other reviews that said to trim the spray top straw, and there was no leaking whatsoever.</li>
            <li>smell, deep and rich brown (</li>
            <li>Even after applying liberally, within 2 days my skin is back to its original color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I am 100% back to my original pallor after a shower.</li>
            <li>The instant brown wears off a little in the shower but you still get a nice glow from the product!  </li>
            <li>You HAVE to make sure that you exfoliate first, and I also used a little bit of baby oil on the rougher areas before applying (ankles, knees, heels, and elbows).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have said, \\&quot;i&#x27;ve tried them all!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but after using Fake Bake Flawless last night, I felt that I absolutely MUST!  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate before I use it &amp; after reading other reviews I trimmed the tip off the spray bottle so it has never leaked from the top as have been some reviewers complaints.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice dark glow that actually looks real, and appears right away.</li>
            <li>I suspect this method reduces the amount of product absorbed into my skin, which in turn shortens the life of my fake tan, but it makes application so fast and easy that I don&#x27;t mind having to do it more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale naturally--really got this more to hide the veins on my legs than to get a tan, but the color has made my legs look so much nicer.  </li>
            <li>The spray is great if you do not want a dramatic change over night</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for a self tanning product that delivers a natural looking tan, is economical, quick and simple to apply!</li>
            <li>It works great the first few times but after that the mitt starts to get crusty and it just doesn&#x27;t apply the same as the first times, doesn&#x27;t apply well at all actually.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an easy to apply, good smelling, natural looking self tanner, I would recommend Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li>I love the tanner, however if you&#x27;re not careful it will streak occasionally.</li>
            <li>It does dry very quickly, and I have not had a problem with it coming off on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>No fake tanner looks like a real tan, but this is by far the closest you can get.  </li>
            <li>everytime you use it to keep it clean and lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I do like the product, it seems pretty much like all the others as far as a tan color.</li>
            <li>Very simple and clean to use.  </li>
            <li>It does dry very quickly and there were areas that looked blended</li>
            <li>This may be called fake bake, but the color it leaves is beautiful and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>Speaking of color, It gave me nice medium bronze with a hint of that redness, similar to the tone you get when coming home from a long beach day.</li>
            <li>Most of my body tans very well but for some reason my legs don&#x27;t get dark.  </li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as off hoped but nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rare that I have any major streaking</li>
            <li>This product left me a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that only looks on the browner side (NO orange or other funky color)</li>
            <li>Application is fail safe, they include a mit, which makes it easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This went on perfect, didn&#x27;t actually have a smell (at least I didn&#x27;t really smell one) and people actually thought I had been tanning at the salon.</li>
            <li>This product dries very fast and so far it stays put on my skin and not on my clothes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am fair skinned (choose not to tan) with some freckles, I have more of a pink complexion and regularly have a few blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I guess it looked good in pictures because you only saw the front of my legs but looked kind of crazy in real life.  </li>
            <li>After i showered, more than 24 hrs later, i was expecting a light to medium tan after two back to back applications.</li>
            <li>I have Irish skin with lots of freckles I have never been able to tan and self tanners turn me orange, I used fake bake and have a nice golden tan after two uses.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about purchasing self tanner online for my daughters high school grad/prom.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to wear a white shirt right after applying and letting dry</li>
            <li>Love love love fake bake!!</li>
            <li>I Love love love fake bake!!</li>
            <li>and it drys fast), and then soften the mitt again before use with a soft brush like a toothbrush or a nail scrubbing brush, not real hard just for a bit to make the mitt soft again so that the tanning product goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I applied it and rinsed it off after 8 hours only to find that certain parts washed off more than others (the color was even before showering)    Three days later</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash the mitt out well after each use, or you will have a stiff, unusable mitt after the first application.  </li>
            <li>It may seem like a hassle to some, but I only tan for special occasions, so</li>
            <li>So I use it for special occasion and try keep it while having my daily routine of hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely picked the right item!</li>
            <li>I got my product super fast once it was back in stock.i</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t soak into the backs of my legs at all, which made the fronts really tan and the backs super white.  </li>
            <li>and this product costs much less and last a lot since comes in good amount</li>
            <li>The glove isn&#x27;t very good quality and gets dirty so fast, and you have to be gentle when washing the glove so it dosen&#x27;t fall apart or get too matted.  </li>
            <li>- i LOVE the color it gives me right after applying &amp; waiting the 6 hours till it sets , but once you take a shower , even if it is the next day , you loose a lot of color .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fantastic thing about this spray is that you can add more or continue to blend it into skin and it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and streaky like other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>Lotions get used up much more quickly AND are more expensive!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly with the mitt that is included, and it has a slight tint</li>
            <li>I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it arrived quickly and has a very minimal smell compared to most self tanners.</li>
            <li>I did not use it for my face though, so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on that, but on the body it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Well, the best thing I can say about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>As a female in my late 20s, I am really looking at all options to provide me with great skin as I age.</li>
            <li>I will be a customer for as long as this product is available...</li>
            <li>liquid rubs on smoothly and due to its chocolate color, you can tell exactly where you&#x27;ve already applied it.</li>
            <li>The only complaint which was pretty popular based on other reviews is that the bottle does leak but its easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>i have tried many self tanning products and normally discontinue use due to the odor.</li>
            <li>I turned orange in spots, light tan in others and completely no tan in others.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of self tanners over the years, including the original Fake Bake lotion, but this light spray goes on flawlessy and has no odor at all!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this product I love it and will always use it&#x27;n looks so natural no orange or streaking just a natural looking tan</li>
            <li>but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It provides a more natural looking color and goes on easily, following the instructions, which are clear.</li>
            <li>If you use the glove that comes with this product and rub in consistent circles, it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have already olive skin and fake bake gives me an even deeper beautiful tan</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;color&#x27; on my face this early in the season.  </li>
            <li>but after 6 hours I took a shower and the excess washed away and just left a nice, even, natural looking tan on my very white legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since then I have used Fake Bake about every 3 days and my legs are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid tanning bed addict since I was young (about 14, and I&#x27;m now 21)</li>
            <li>it looks DARK but is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked the color it gave and the ease of application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless self tanners out there and this one BY FAR gives me the most natural looking.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a nice tan, usually after 2 applications.</li>
            <li>, I look natural and i have a pretty glow.</li>
            <li>After only one application, it gave me a nice golden color that was even and lasted through a couple showers (I exfoliate everyday) without seeming to fade.  </li>
            <li>whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  </li>
            <li>My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  </li>
            <li>My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure this bottle will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s more than plenty dark for me.</li>
            <li>The color on the skin looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Next time I will just go back and pay the $10 extra at Ulta to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li>only negative thing I have to say is that I wish the color was more build able</li>
            <li>WOW, This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it made my stretch marks dark and waaaaay more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It still feels just as full some 8-10 applications later as when I got it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;m pretty surprised on the reviews and the scale of the emotions some users express.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the mixture is darker, you can even see if you have any dark patches you need to mix in more.</li>
            <li>The first application made my skin darker but natural looking.  </li>
            <li>looks fairly natural and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>The Mit is nice to use, but small pieces come off of it when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I am a mother of two, full of figure and white as a sheet.  </li>
            <li>While researching Fake Bake Flawless, I noticed that most of the negative reviews were from fair-skinned women like myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Micro Mist (a good cheapie), L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (a glittery and splotchy mess) and countless others...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not bad, but I wish it would last  and stay longer on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful for that review, as it was very detailed and helpful to me, as it obviously was to countless others.  </li>
            <li>But the next morning after showering, I was left with a very light, orangey color.</li>
            <li>Overall, most raved about this product, however for someone who is naturally pale like me ( meaning I have no base tan whatsoever)</li>
            <li>After all the years of using self tanners, finely one that actually looks natural.</li>
            <li>The reason this is hands down my favorite tanner, even though I&#x27;ve found one that is darker</li>
            <li>but I made sure to lay down a towel before I went to sleep</li>
            <li>most of the color would wash down the drain.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>SURE TO LAY A TOWEL DOWN WHERE YOU WILL BE DOING THE SUNLESS TANNING.</li>
            <li>When I push the button down, liquid also seeps out around the perimeter of the spray top.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on my mitt and start from the top of my leg and work my way down when I get to my feet</li>
            <li>Better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to purchase more and I will never purchase any other product ever again!</li>
            <li>: It dried really fast, and was pretty easy to see where I&#x27;d put it already</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve developed a quick, simple application method for those of you who are interested.</li>
            <li>A little streaky - but good stuff overall!</li>
            <li>a fair skinned Asian and wanted just a little bit of tanning.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated the mitt for applying the tanner to my body and the odor was better than some others I have tried but for some reason all the little sunspots I have on me from not using sunscreen when I was a teenager&lt;br /&gt;Turn</li>
            <li>If you do professionally spray tan this would be nice to use to extend the tan a little longer, sort of like maintaining it.</li>
            <li>Apply as little or as much with the mist and glove it couldn&#x27;t be easier or better.</li>
            <li>I live it!</li>
            <li>I am new to the fake tan world, but after using Million Dollar tan, there is nothing else as good!</li>
            <li>I had what I will call my new, permanent color!</li>
            <li>Also, to keep your mitt like new every time you use it,  rinse it thoroughly every time you use it,  then throw it in the dryer!</li>
            <li>MY NEW GO TO!</li>
            <li>I used this in the evening after watching some YouTube reviews (I&#x27;m new to this!) and had zero problems with application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without the stuff &amp; Amazons price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to sunless tanner!</li>
            <li>I feel like a new woman!  </li>
            <li>Over the past month or two I have tried several different self tanning products, this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I am an experienced self tanner and this product was hard to blend and when it wore off left streaks.  </li>
            <li>If you are tired of frying your skin in the tanning bed and want to look good when you&#x27;re older but want that summer glow try it you will not regret it!</li>
            <li>one is easy to use, works fast &amp; does not cake &amp; peel off after a couple days like the other spray on ones do.&lt;br /&gt;After just 3 days</li>
            <li>I live in Fl, so this didn&#x27;t do much in terms of darkening for me.</li>
            <li>really like the color and new look</li>
            <li>(I live in the desert with a very extended summer)</li>
            <li>With a new baby at home, I don&#x27;t have much time to be in the sun.</li>
            <li>I had no color left...and the insides of my elbow creases were huge white oblong parts where the tanner had completely wiped off.</li>
            <li>I love the fake bake flawless because I want a subtle tan</li>
            <li>I liken this to more of a staining tan product than the typical tanning cream product.  </li>
            <li>I often just apply to my lower half bc I tend to get more sun on my arms and face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found out that less is more.</li>
            <li>I took the advice of previous reviewers and followed all tips, which I am sure</li>
            <li>However, if you apply it too often, the color does become less believable.  </li>
            <li>previous poster suggested trimming the spray bottle&#x27;s straw, and that is so important!  </li>
            <li>You can control the amount applied way more than typical lotions.</li>
            <li>As the bottle emptied the rubbing into my skin became less noticeable and took more sprays.</li>
            <li>Apply it before bed, its really easy and wash it off in the morning, about half the color gets washed away but whats left if a light BROWN (not orange) tan.</li>
            <li>Less is more.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more since I like the end results and this product cost less then most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is typical of most self tanners I have used though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lotion but gave me much better color for less.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost impossible to blend it all perfectly again.</li>
            <li>: make sure to cut about an inch and a half off of the straw BEFORE inserting it into the tanner bottle.</li>
            <li>However, it is extremely easy to use if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li>You definitely want to make sure that you exfoliate and moisturize your skin prior to using it.  </li>
            <li>So i&#x27;m constantly alternating between being super bronzed looking and looking like</li>
            <li>I have tried several drugstore tanning products and none of them compare with Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>AwayTips:&lt;br /&gt;- Do not be afraid to apply generously... just be sure to rub in nice and evenly</li>
            <li>I was pregnant in the winter months so never got any sun, and used this very regularly.</li>
            <li>I was very white so color showed up quick this morning.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy a second bottle if I didn&#x27;t absolutely love a product because I always like trying out different products.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this stuff and it gives her a decent tanned look all things considered.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning spray after watching countless review videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li>B000RUD6EK GlowFusion Micro-Nutrient Face and Body Natural Protein Tan, Light Formula, 5.0 Fluid Ounces (147.85ml)]]</li>
            <li>My main issue with it though was that it stunk-</li>
            <li>Spreads evenly, absorbs instantly, dries quickly, DOESN&#x27;T stink.</li>
            <li>So the next night, because it dries so quickly, I applied it twice before bed.</li>
            <li>OK so I love fake Bake.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used this product before, I&#x27;ve been using body drench quick tan before this and am going back to that product after this.</li>
            <li>and I have bought MANY over the last ten years&lt;</li>
            <li>I also tried one of the Banana Boat products, but the smell was super perfumy;  it streaked, it took forever to absorb, it was super messy  and the results were very John Boehner;</li>
            <li>It still was decent though.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the Fake Bake product is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Next I tried Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase this product, I&#x27;ve actually already got some more on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this spray but it was different then what expected I used the st topez along with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;-fades quickly with water, almost all with facial cleanser</li>
            <li>It smells decent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking streaky or orange.</li>
            <li>First off the color tan that I got is a definite ORANGE - remember some of those first self-tanners?  </li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best fake tan I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love having a tan in the winter and most people don&#x27;t believe or can&#x27;t tell if&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li>If you have tried several other home tanning products but have never been quite satisfied, try this one!</li>
            <li>I have the same brand for the face, which is different because it is more like a cream.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased this product, and the first time I bought it was a year ago - it really lasts!</li>
            <li>I also got Fake Bake for faces - and I love that stuff even more.  </li>
            <li>I am a self tanner junkie and have tried any decent product I can get my hands on.</li>
            <li>if it would only last more than a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After finishing a whole bottle of Fake Bake, I&#x27;m happy to report that the velour mitten is still in tact.</li>
            <li>it has a bit of a red tint, so It looks completely natural and streak free.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just the chemical reaction with my particular skin type, but I found it intolerable.  </li>
            <li>Need to invest in a decent application mit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-A decent amount of product comes off if you apply at night in shower in the morning like recommended, I prefer to apply in the morning/afternoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different tanners that have left me streaky, smelly, and orange.</li>
            <li>Being as ghostly white as I am I was super nervous to try this.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I took a shower and made sure to exfoliate very well, got out (dried off, etc.) and applied the self tanner as the directions had said.</li>
            <li>i have been using jergens daily glow to keep from getting super pasty</li>
            <li>No messy hands that you have to be careful to wash before they stain, and it seems to blend in to the skin even better than the lotion did.</li>
            <li>Goes on quickly and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>The shade is a bit lighter than other self tanners that I have used but it looks SO much more natural!</li>
            <li>I opened the second bottle and it came with a set of the blue gloves, and a mitt but no sprayer so make sure you keep the sprayer.  </li>
            <li>I did find that the product does have the classic &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here today ordering my second bottle of the Fake Bske because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t last long...seems to fade fairly quick.</li>
            <li>I had the Fake Bake lotion before and while I did like the color it gave me, it left my skin feeling a bit sticky and the smell wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use Fake Bake Flawless....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Fades rather quickly but in that respect similar to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am an older redhead.</li>
            <li>This particular one seems sort of &#x27;expired&#x27; or something.  </li>
            <li>So glad my sister talked me into trying Fake Bake, I am now a bronze beauty. :)</li>
            <li>Product does deliver both immediate and gradual results but washes off so quickly that it needs constant re application.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face, neck, arms during the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get a great tan without all that annoying skin cancer risk.  </li>
            <li>but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve been concerned about the effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Best fake tanner I have ever used, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Instant quick fix for pasty skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve found at the drugstore and wasn&#x27;t much more expensive.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, but I grew tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even smart to blow dry your body with COOL AIR before application even if you haven&#x27;t just gotten out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, tan is very natural.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and have a VERY natural color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very even, no streaking, and a very natural color..</li>
            <li>Really like the mitten-is very soft on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for fake bake flawless after reading countless reviews.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it more, and again it does work, but the cons make it hard to want to use it consistently</li>
            <li>I was surprised after the mass of positive reviews how lukewarm I was on this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and it gave me a nice brown tan not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much my skin was going to like this product because I am fairly pale.</li>
            <li>I think the more basic, plain CLEAN</li>
            <li>I am someone who is very new to self tanning, I have only tried a couple of other brands, and I just couldn&#x27;t quite get the hang of a nice, even tan.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t have that bad &amp;#34;fake tan smell.&amp;#34; I really love it!</li>
            <li>The color is very flattering and natural looking, I think I almost gave my dermatologist a heart attack when I went in for a check up!</li>
            <li>Goes on very even, dries in seconds with no residue, shows where color has been applied, and looks natural!</li>
            <li>No streaking and a very natural brown (not orange!)</li>
            <li>When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Mixed feelings, works great for a tan, but the smell and how you feel the days following are almost not worth the tan.</li>
            <li>Very Natural Color!</li>
            <li>color isn&#x27;t too orange and came off very natural!</li>
            <li>Looks very natural!</li>
            <li>VERY NATURAL LOOKING!</li>
            <li>Looks very natural!</li>
            <li>The easiest way is to snip off about an inch off the bottom of the spray top and use that instead of the lotion cap to avoid mess.</li>
            <li>I had a bit left in the old bottle too, so I used some in the new and poured the rest from the old bottle into the new one. :)</li>
            <li>You can wear light loose cloths if wanted.</li>
            <li>While this color is great for me, I find it does streak on me when my skin is dry, and I have moisturized for a few days!</li>
            <li>so I stripped down with my new container (which did not leak from the top).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>its very important to &#x27;loofah&#x27; or scrub dead skin before application.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe the demand is just getting too high</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this product.</li>

            <li>Like it a lot but fond that sun labs tanner actually works better and lasts longer and is only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I read numerous reviews for different products and decided that Fake Bake Flawless was worth trying.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist also told me I shouldn&#x27;t because of my high risk skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(yes, they used to call me \\&quot;Casper\\&quot; in high school)</li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend giving it a try even if you&#x27;ve tried everything else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>HIGHLY IMPROVES THE LOOK OF YOUR EXTREMITIES WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SCARS AND DISCOLORIZATION.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>From drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t get your hopes too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>Anywho, if you&#x27;ve never used this stuff, I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>It honestly looks very much like other tanning products, I felt, and even though I exfoliated and followed directions to lotion up around the knees and rough patches, it still grabbed there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to continue to purchase it, but I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as amazing as all of the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li>its a no brainier, this stuff is so much staffer, looks way nice, and last, plus cost soo much less.</li>
            <li>product dries quickly and you can get dressed within 10 minutes - not 2 hours (did I mention my last self-tanning adventure involved sitting naked in the tub watching Golden Girls for 2 hours?).</li>
            <li>The product goes on evenly, dries super fast, and has a very deep natural color.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I gave four stars is because you have to really make sure to moisturize and exfoliate or it can leave dry patches and look splotchy in areas like elbows, ankles and wrists.</li>
            <li>However, it is as easy as slipping on pantyhose to make your legs look freshly tanned vs. white as a ghost.</li>
            <li>she just pierced a hole in the center and inserted the tube through the hole and hers worked fine doing it that way.  </li>
            <li>Line the counter and sink with a large old towel</li>
            <li>Compared to my usual spray tan, this one washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>This looks so natural and NO STREAKS!!</li>
            <li>Looks natural!!</li>
            <li>Have to reapply every couple of day, and I wish it gave me a little more color than it does...</li>
            <li>Each day lightening a little bit more.</li>
            <li>This is even better than having a spray tan done because you get to choose how dark to go!</li>
            <li>I bought a jergens one that seemed to work a little better plus a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>&amp; of course I love the fact that I can protect my health a little bit from using this product &amp; staying away from tanning beds.</li>
            <li>you want a little more color.</li>
            <li>I would stick to this, but it requires a little more upkeep if you wash your face twice a day like me.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little more streaky than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I learned that the deep rich brown color, is the color guard, pretty much an instant bronzer that guides you in applying the stuff evenly on your body.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels with a little sun-kissed glow, NOT leather couch skin or cheeto skin</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a dream come true!</li>
            <li>I was going to the tanning bed hibitually to prepare for spring break until I found this little gem :)</li>
            <li>I tried pray tans but looked a little orange even with the better brands</li>
            <li>little do they know I&#x27;m doing it the \\&quot;safe</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t think I need to apply it 5 days in a row, as I tan rather quickly, so every other day will be fine until I reach the desired shade.</li>
            <li>I am as pasty as it gets, I am always getting comments on how pasty I am and how I&#x27;d look so much better with a little tan or bronzer.</li>
            <li>So natural and safer than using a tanning bed!!</li>
            <li>Third, the mitt got scraggly and pilled even after the first use!</li>
            <li>It is a little bit of a labor of love to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;which may be applied a little easier and more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It could be designed a little better but it is what it is</li>
            <li>I love it when I just want to look a little tanner before I go out.</li>
            <li>If you want a little darker color, just use more sprays.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a pretty large amount of self tanners, and this one and Sungoddess are the only two i will use!</li>
            <li>You really can not mess this up!</li>
            <li>I will say this faded very quickly for me, and I had to reapply every other day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tanning products and none has been as easy to use as this one.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other mitts that I&#x27;ve used, this one will allow the product to easily seep through</li>
            <li>I like that the product doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner smell that other products reek of.</li>
            <li>BUT it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as other brands I&#x27;ve tried AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get on even</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is like any other self-tanner, strong and bothersome.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mess up my newly applied tan :)</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a long-lasting natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Very natural-looking, forgiving if you put it on a little unevenly, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have used for last year and half and love this product!</li>
            <li>It tries FAST and will leave some streaks if you don&#x27;t rub in right away!</li>
            <li>I have very light olive skin (due to my lack of desire for skin cancer) with several large colored tattoos.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t use it all the time is because it is a little more time consuming than just lotion and with a new infant around, my time is pretty used up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant, this producted prevented me from being super pale at my baby shower.  </li>
            <li>Also, applying it to your whole body or most of it uses be very little of the bottle</li>
            <li>This product was very easy to apply using the mitt, however the spray bottle has begun to leak all over my bathroom so its very messy.  </li>
            <li>The color Fake Bake produced was beautiful, for I am not pale anyways,</li>
            <li>Secondly, the application goes on very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t dry before I am done applying it</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly if you do it right and last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>the smell isnt bad at all and the best part</li>
            <li>Everywhere else it looks perfect and doesnt look bad on my stomach either</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>My tan was very even and natural.</li>
            <li>Works great and it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Allow the product to dry, I normally just hang out, clean up the news paper, and put everything</li>
            <li>This is by far waaaaay better than the more expensive stuff I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and there is not a product that you can receive as great results so quickly as Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use it again a second time a few weeks later and wasn&#x27;t too happy with the mit.</li>
            <li>but in reading around on Amazon, I read the great reviews here for Fake Bake, and decided since it was not a spray-on product</li>
            <li>Does great job of coverage, goes on even and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li>They were all very orange looking and never looked natural....</li>
            <li>it works really well and looks like my natural tan</li>
            <li>Looks real natural when it develops and it also gives you some color as you put it on.</li>
            <li>it smells like day old self tanner and too much perfume.</li>
            <li>I think the color is very even and natural looking.</li>
            <li>every use of the buffing pad clean it off and hang it to dry in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray on the mitt and rub in circles lightly over toes, and then harder on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, the reviews on here were great, so I thought how can I go wrong?</li>
            <li>In this case, while the reviews were great, I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li>It really does leave your skin beautifully natural and bronzed.</li>
            <li>I spray directly on my skin and then rub it in, otherwise the mitt absorbs too much.</li>
            <li>so tanning beds and natural sun have never done a whole lot for me; except burn.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is a great product.</li>
            <li>Friends have been surprised because it looks real.  </li>
            <li>but since my body isn&#x27;t that bikini ready anyway, I&#x27;ve been just applying it to my legs and arms and tummy, steering clear of the boobs.</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged caucasion male, and this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The color is natural looking, dries fast</li>
            <li>a girl at work who uses fake bake and always has great color,  suggested it to me.</li>
            <li>I wash mine with my shampoo until it runs clear, wring it out gently, and hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did give me the most natural, most even fake tan that I&#x27;ve ever had though.</li>
            <li>Natural color,no streaking,or missed spots thanks to the color guide.</li>
            <li>I was still very weary since it seems that no matter what I try, I can never get natural looking results.</li>
            <li>Works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Another important thing to note, application can get pretty messy.</li>
            <li>And i exfoliated every few days to try and make the tan fade more evenly, but it still looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;-Since</li>
            <li>It gave me a deep summer golden glow.</li>
            <li>Aferw rinsing, you&#x27;re left with a golden tan.</li>
            <li>Water will run brownish, and is normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanners, and normally I use Xen Tan but decided I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a better looking, darker color than tanning everyday.</li>
            <li>It in my opinion is well worth the money especially when compared to what it costs to get a spray tan.</li>
            <li>It truely dries instantly on your skin, with NO horrible odor usually associated with self tanners.</li>
            <li>i wish there was more green tone tho, so that it would cancel out any redness and orange</li>
            <li>I am planning on buying more in the future and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>And yes this is a reasonable conclusion to think, but first let me tell you, I have a medical skin condition.</li>
            <li>Now I blend in with all the people around me with normal levels of melanin in their skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with a yellowish/greenish skin tone so this product makes my skin look golden.</li>
            <li>Most products take a few hours to develop.</li>
            <li>It gives you a really natural dark color and streak free!</li>
            <li>Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as I decide to tan this would b the only product I ever use :-)</li>
            <li>Color is good, however, not as dark as expected.</li>
            <li>Only sign of any sunless tanner smell is when you first wash in the shower after applying...and even then, the smell is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t risk skin cancer when you can have a beautiful, natural looking Fake Bake tan.</li>
            <li>I found that after 1 application for 3 consecutive days, I achieved a tan that I would only hope to get after a summer&#x27;s worth of tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times, and I love my color.</li>
            <li>But overall I thin it is one of the best especially if you don&#x27;t want to wait a week for the moisturizer types to work.</li>
            <li>I apply, I use a few sprays in a tiny bowl and mix in just enough good white lotion (in this case, &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; by Designer Skin) to allow myself to spread the product with smooth and even coverage after thoroughly exfoliating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, please make sure to wash the mit that is included with product every few tans.</li>
            <li>It was a tint of green, more like a blue-green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some interesting experiences with self-tanners in the past and was ready to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Fake Bake at a Beauty Salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is in fact NOT a negative review.</li>
            <li>just make sure they are heavily moisturized.</li>
            <li>wear full coverage cotton panties and give your self a wedgie immediately after applying the tanner and for a couple hours so that the color won&#x27;t run even from minor sweating and concentrate on your bum crack edges.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the extra work -</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it a few hours before bed</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can spray the tanner directly onto most parts of your body, but for parts such as your face, hands, feet, elbows, knees, neck and back, you will want to spray the tanner onto your mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After you shower the next day, it washes off in some places but, not others so, it will never be an even tan.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li>However, I use quite a bit of it, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it would for most people.</li>
            <li>coconut does not smell like normal self tanners.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give this 5 starts because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my favorite (Million Dollar Tan).  </li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for products</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works from the dead of winter on my fair skin, to a touch up in the middle of the summer to cover bikini lines or even the natural tan from the sun that I have.</li>
            <li>I also have a few tattoos that I care to keep looking nice, especially because I&#x27;ve invested so much money into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>goes on without streaks, looks natural, and one layer is light enough even if you make a mistake (which i did while I&#x27;m getting the hang of it) that it isn&#x27;t completely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product but even after exfoliating using a Kae exfoliating glove, it still goes on unevenly and looks orange.</li>
            <li>it has more of a green undertone than orange an</li>
            <li>but more importantly, it never develops the &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li>normal people tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update on again on the progress of color after a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>Love this self tanner it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping for ( about 3 days instead of a week)</li>
            <li>I took a shower in the morning and the excess washed off and left behind a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>So overall, I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this product again, it just not worth the price and in order for me to keep any kind of color I have to put a ton of it on</li>
            <li>I love the color, I am also pretty white &amp; it wasn&#x27;t to dark or orange.</li>
            <li>Second, it does not last long, it may give you a nice glow but after 2-3 showers its pretty much completely gone.</li>
            <li>Normally they&#x27;re streaky and orange.</li>
            <li>It gives a great long lasting dark color.</li>
            <li>When I try to tan normally all that happens is my freckles get darker</li>
            <li>I do notice the green, which I am sure this is to counteract the orange, so, you don&#x27;t want to put this on then leave the house.</li>
            <li>or make sure you wipe off the dried excess product with</li>
            <li>I used fake bake first, and felt like it was good product.</li>
            <li>It is  pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>So make sure you use it fast and don&#x27;t use it if it looks green!</li>
            <li>but once you wash it off you are left with a golden tan.</li>
            <li>but overall it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I do it every time, and it&#x27;s been used three times now to equal success each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I saw the small container of it, I didn&#x27;t want to be having to purchase more of it very often.</li>
            <li>I put a layer on and thought maybe I will like this, but after a full day I just went back to my natural skin tone, which is disapointing.</li>
            <li>also make sure you don&#x27;t sweat or go out in the rain after you use it that color guard is messy and will get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>If I put it on one day it pretty much comes off with the following shower.</li>
            <li>I stopped tanning because of how many customers would come in crying about getting skin cancer (yet they still tanned?)</li>
            <li>gets you looking like you went somewhere nice and hot and spent your whole time laying out when really you just spent a few minutes rubbing the fake bake flawless in...</li>
            <li>I was so tired of spending money trying to find a good self tanner.</li>
            <li>So, If you want a nice &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; golden tan and your really fair, like me, try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!   </li>
            <li>Takes a few days to build up, when tint washes off a lot of the color is lost, be careful on knuckles color can build up, thanks for good transaction.</li>
            <li>Whether you  are new or experienced with fake tanning, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had been driving with the windows down and my left arm was more naturally tan than the right</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t leave streaks at long as you cover everything...which easy enough since you can see where it is going on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li>although it seems to take so little to rub in, I think this bottle may last quite awhile, even better!</li>
            <li>The tan is super natural, golden, and dark.</li>
            <li>It was a nice realistic color otherwise, just not good for my older skin.</li>
            <li>live in FL, so try to stay tan year round, mostly the beach during the summer, but use this stuff during the winter to keep my color.</li>
            <li>First, spray the mitt, rub it on evenly (which I had no problem doing) and it dries right away although you can&#x27;t get wet for about 5 hours</li>
            <li>I have gotten my Mom to get this, who is even more pale than I am</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been extremely pale and never been able to tan.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m more of an olive tone , my friend is really pale , she uses it once a day , &amp; doesn&#x27;t tan in salons .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its ok ,doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>The application mitt is AMAZING, although its surface becomes less applicable, the nap enhances your initial results.</li>
            <li>I think it lasts like two days on me, but I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fake tan smell.</li>
            <li>It stays on well and gives super white people like me a natural tan.  </li>
            <li>however, most of the ones I&#x27;ve used have a weird smell or streak easily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a self tanner that did not have an odd odor and gave a nice bronze color that lasted for several days.</li>
            <li>The application is easy and my fake tan never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It will fade very quickly and likely only give you color for 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Micro-mist can easily be sprayed to the middle of my back without rubbing or staining floors.</li>
            <li>Instant tan and is easy enough to apply even minutes before going out for the day/night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (only took me about 8 minutes total to apply) and</li>
            <li>He actually commented this morning that he did not smell anything at all and that it looks super natural,</li>
            <li>Needless to say, we both love this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and will keep using it.  </li>
            <li>first get the dry skin off and also apply lotion to elbows,ankles, knees, etc first because it gets darker on those spots  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, it&#x27;s easy to use and looks great!!!</li>
            <li>the brightest moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for ladies with busts that are larger... make sure when you do your chest area, you are careful to have a fan at the ready so that you can dry the area rather quickly.</li>
            <li>&amp; it does not make you SUPER dark the first time you use it</li>
            <li>threw out all of the other self tanners that probably added up to $500, and I will definitely purchase more of this very soon, plus one for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guide color is very dark, which was great because you really can&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not the fastest, I think properly prepping your skin and applying this right makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before applying the tanner I exfoliated one time earlier in the week, and then again right before the application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally streaky right off the bat.</li>
            <li>I only use this product on my face and neck right now because i dont want to wear foundation</li>
            <li>(ie: right leg, left leg, chest, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but obviously it was not the right tanner for me.</li>
            <li>As for the reviews that say the tan washes off the next morning, I would like to debunke that right now.</li>
            <li>Dries instantly, you can get dressed right after&lt;</li>
            <li>and I personally like that it washes right off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it all right away and went to use it a month or so later.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that I learned when using this is... do not use it right after you have shaved your legs.</li>
            <li>so I can hop into bed right after and wake up with a tan the next morning.</li>
            <li>simple to use,tans evenly,great smell and the price is right.</li>
            <li>all the brown spray cleaned right off later).  </li>
            <li>I did, however, accidentally spray it on a pair of white pants, and it washed right off in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>It fades very evenly and even looks natural as the color fades (seems to lose a little bit of the red and just look like a nice brown/golden tan).</li>
            <li>i am very pale and this gave a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>If certain spots look a little thicker, the residual product washes off in the shower so it looks smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product!</li>
            <li>I have figured out how to use the spray without making a huge mess, yet I am saddened that I am wasting as much as I am using.</li>
            <li>If your not sure or are UN happy with other self banners Then give this a try.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and provides a dark tan</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s dark brown color makes it easy to see whre</li>
            <li>Since the tanning liquid is dark, it is easy to see where you have applied it.  </li>
            <li>so you either need to add more or scrub it off, and it is not easy to get off</li>
            <li>Relatively easy to apply but way too dark for my ivory skin.  </li>
            <li>The color tome was good, gave me a tan that was not too dark, and with careful application it does not streak!</li>
            <li>I followed many tips from previous reviewers and would agree that with proper application and a little common sense this stuff is wonderful.....</li>
            <li>; Dark Tanner which seemed to be a little more subtle - great for last minute application the night before for a special event.</li>
            <li>My skin has yellow undertones and the color is very natural looking, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply especially with this mitt!  </li>
            <li>Received fake bake and love the product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will fail to forcibly confine you to your bathroom naked with a good friend watching Betty White for two hours wondering how in the hell you are going to explain what happened to the tub to mom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d worry about getting too dark if I used Original any more frequently than this.&lt;br /&gt;-Flawless, on the other hand, takes a couple consecutive nights to get it to a darker color, then probably a touch-up every 4 days or so?</li>
            <li>Mitts however, only work when you first get them, after one wash they start to develop these balls / pills that make the texture hard and tan doesn&#x27;t apply as effectively.</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell but not bad like most other products.  </li>
            <li>It was not extreme and no streaks, when he washed very little came off and the spray has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I just walk around the house naked for awhile to make sure its 1,000 percent dry before I apply my clothes!</li>
            <li>First, this gives you a more subtle color</li>
            <li>I have very light skin tone with natural blonde hair,blue eyes, and it takes very long time to tan</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, no streaks and the smell is not as unpleasant as most self tanners.  </li>
            <li>and you can buy hospital gloves on the cheap at other stores,</li>
            <li>Exfoliating first then applying to dry clean skin is key.</li>
            <li>Its a little messy getting on, but I have had a lot of complements and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so liquidy and watery, whereas my other tanners were thicker lotions or a light</li>
            <li>I do recommend moisturizing your skin with your daily lotion BEFORE applying Fake Bake Flawless, but that generally goes for any self tanning product.</li>
            <li>I have a light olive complexion but I am lighter due to stayimg out of the sun.</li>
            <li>I woke up with a natural glow but wanted a little more</li>
            <li>you live in florida</li>
            <li>I am completely new to bottled tan products.</li>
            <li>I live this product.</li>
            <li>This is surely my new \\&quot;gold standard!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Scrap the mitt and but a new one for 10 bucks that doesn&#x27;t need a glove underneath</li>
            <li>I will do that again with my new one.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida but do not want to LOOK like I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I live in a not so sunny part of the country</li>
            <li>I had to order a new mit.  </li>
            <li>Without applying any new product to the mitt go ahead and do the tops and sides of your feet and toes, backs of hands, fingers and wrists avoiding the cuticles.</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it...</li>
            <li>so you get a new one each time.</li>
            <li>I hope I can find a new one.</li>
            <li>I moved from Florida to New York</li>
            <li>There was just no way this product was going to live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li>Did not return or ask for a refund because as a sunless tanner trying new products this is the risk you take, I do not believe in returning just because it did not work for me, I used the product about 5 times and threw away.</li>
            <li>I do live the humid south and if you apply this and then go get sweaty</li>
            <li>I can live with coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d never know I live in the Alaskan wilderness.  </li>
            <li>As with any new product, you have to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas</li>
            <li>If someone know a trick to that, then let me in on that because I&#x27;m fairly new at using self tanners.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a natural looking tan, this will be your new go to!</li>
            <li>I am not naturally pale, but this definitely helps give me the golden tan that I want without having to use tanning beds anymore.</li>
            <li>All self tanners have the same underlying smell from the active ingredient, but this one is very minimal, and the scent itself is great.  </li>
            <li>I live in CA at the beach where it&#x27;s pretty much sunny all year long.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t make it so its a huge difference in color but enough to wear dresses and short sleeve shirts and have some color.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to try any because I have seen a lot of people left with a very orange-y aftereffect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few self tanners and this one gives the most natural color of any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>My flannel gray sheets did get a brownish red tint on them as I slept with freshly applied tanner on myself, but it completely washed out when I washed them.</li>
            <li>There will always be drawbacks, but so far, Fake Bake has been a surprisingly great product</li>
            <li>Have used many self tanners, cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li>but it would dry so quickly</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s better than the spray tans that make your whole bathroom/hallway stink for a day.  </li>
            <li>As always, make sure you are careful with hands, knees, elbows, and feet, but the mitt definitely helps this issue.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, and if it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li>(I have super dry skin).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do tanning booths, I was in the middle of my finals for my Ph.D. for several months during the summer and my skin hadn&#x27;t seen the light of day for months</li>
            <li>I then put a light coat of lotion on my knees, ankles, tops and sides of both feet, wrists (inner and outer), elbows (inner and outer) and around my armpits.</li>
            <li>dry quickly.    </li>
            <li>It does dry quickly</li>
            <li>my bottle is about half gone and the mitt is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased to get even a little color!</li>
            <li>I also love how smooth it goes on and very little streaking if you&#x27;re careful!</li>
            <li>It will make your legs have little brown spots all over if you apply right after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>This is very natural looking and quick to apply and dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single product out there for creating a fake tan, and this stuff is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I had a little problem at first, but I learned quickly how to apply it, it just takes practice like anything.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, and isn&#x27;t splotchy or runny.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it isn&#x27;t that dark unless you apply it at least twice within 24 hours  but again the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>very natural looking</li>
            <li>This one gives you an instant tan, very real looking.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly without streaking and a very natural brown vs orange like some others.</li>

            <li>Exfoliate first and let a light moisturizer sink in before using if you have dry skin, otherwise it can stick to dry spots.</li>

            <li>I love the mitt application, NO STREAKS and you use VERY little product.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think it last as long as I would like, but it is so easy to apply</li>
            <li>super dark woman, thanks</li>
            <li>The tan is super easily buildable over just a few days and is pretty long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>she had a very nice light brown (base) tan.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and can go as light or dark as I want.</li>
            <li>I imagine you could apply more often or thicker to get a deeper color, but I usually stick with re-applying every 3-5 days and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on with an enclosed smooth glove and left no streaks, it dried immediately so you don&#x27;t have to avoid furniture or clothes for an hour, and it left my legs brown not orange.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is amazing!</li>
            <li>have used so many self tanners that have all rubbed off on my clothes or came off in the shower or just stunk really bad, and I finally found this one that smells really good applying it</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that didn&#x27;t leave streaks on me and that actually made me look alot darker.</li>
            <li>Feels Soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>In comparison to different tanning formulas, specifically lotions, I find that they develop better on my skin and my golden tan stays that way for at least 5 days before I need to reaaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>After watching many reviews I decided to buy this product I was skeptical at first since it was my first time tanning</li>
            <li>After I washed it off the first morning, I actually reapplied it because I had plans to go out that night.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and goes on evenly!  </li>
            <li>So natural!</li>
            <li>I use a sigma f80 brush after I have applied moisturizer to spread it on my face/neck/ears area and it eliminates the need completely for a separate face tanner!.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, especially for first time self tanner users, because it is tinted</li>
            <li>even after 3 days the tan still looks natural it is not orange at all!  </li>
            <li>And I have sensitive acne prone skin, and I have not broke out from this!</li>
            <li>Use regular lotion first so you don&#x27;t get any blotches.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this time it has been streaking on my skin more than usual.</li>
            <li>Take a shower first and exfoliate if you want the tan to last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re interested in this product also invest in some extra mitts if you want to continue to use.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My husband kids me when I wear dresses about my legs providing light for a dark room.</li>
            <li>The only con would be to make sure you are prepared to change your bedsheets the next day as it does transfer (not necessarily taking your applied color off).</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already completely hooked!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me more than the ten minutes (other reviewers stated)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me more than the ten minutes (other reviewers stated)</li>
            <li>The benefit to this is you can make it as dark or as light as you want, you can mix it with any fragrance lotion and it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you are wearing self-tanner</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many self tanners in the past and I will never use another one after finding this.</li>
            <li>and oh so natural!</li>
            <li>After 3-4 applications in a row (only exfoliating the first time)</li>
            <li>and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>Color looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li>So natural!</li>
            <li>Not orange, natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>This one far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>This is better then spray tans I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>So I recommend following that first review to a tee, except replacing the Baiden mitten with a Korean Italy pocket cloth.  </li>
            <li>But, low and behold, it just needed that first application period, I guess, to get settled in.  </li>
            <li>My love for fake bake products started with the original lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used many different self-tanners before in my life, and from the reviews, I was expecting a lot more when I used Fake Bake.</li>
            <li>I faked everyone with this product that I had tanned naturally over a weekend!</li>
            <li>word of caution, make sure you wear gloves under your mitt or you&#x27;ll end up with orange hands :/</li>
            <li>I have more then enough left to use several times.</li>
            <li>and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Million Dollar Tanning products, and I&#x27;ve got to say that this by far beats it!</li>
            <li>This is only required before the first use.</li>
            <li>or it will look funny and not adhere to your skin properly.</li>
            <li>I have been using Fake Bake the original lotion for years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>complaints so far!</li>
            <li>This has definitely been better than some of the other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried but still not what I was hoping for, once again.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed how natural this product feels and looks!</li>
            <li>I trusted the reviews and bought this and WOW!  </li>
            <li>One bottle will last you a couple months with consistent use.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, not orange at all!</li>
            <li>It gives off a color similar to Loreal&#x27;s original Sublime Glow, which was a different formula than the one they use now.</li>
            <li>--It looks really natural!</li>
            <li>I can put enough spray on to make myself look pretty tan, and even keep it on for 12 hours before taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Repurchased the same week I started using the first bottle.</li>
            <li>overall, the bottle says to reapply for darker results, which I plan on doing the next couple nights to see if I notice a significant difference or not.  </li>
            <li>it lasts about 2-3 days and is pretty faded by the 3rd day.</li>
            <li>However, I washed it in warm water and used a teasing brush to fluff it back up (eyelash or bristle brush would have the same effect).</li>
            <li>If the mitt had velour on both sides, there would be risk for rubbing extra tanning solution in random places, most notably on your body where it can leave a streak.</li>
            <li>Most unbelievably of all?</li>
            <li>The original formula is messy and stinky but worked really well</li>
            <li>It goes on more smoothly, no streaks, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells like a coconut sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I received several compliments on my tan the first week I used it, and someone even asked if I had gone to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only my first time using it</li>
            <li>I was able to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and ten minutes later put on my white summer evening dress.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best,  it doesn&#x27;t smell funky and fake other self tanners,  </li>
            <li>and I had such a pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how my instant tan looked SO REAL !</li>
            <li>and even then you must have to sleep splayed out, on your back all night so as to keep your legs from touching each other, etc.&lt;br /&gt;......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same color I got from the salon self tanner, no weird orange color but can be streaky until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t leak at all during my first application last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I totally reccomend this product and it got me through a whole summer with just ONE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li>i ordered this product and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>if anything it makes my skin look more even and hides my scars now!i usually have to use concealer over foundation to even out my skin and today i just used a bit of BB cream.</li>
            <li>It looks natural looking!  </li>
            <li>In my early years I worshipped the tanning bed just so I could look normal in the summer months</li>
            <li>, so I know exactly how you should properly prep your skin and apply.)</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>I noticed a pretty glowing tan instantly!</li>
            <li>Fake bake actually smells good!</li>
            <li>After showering I looked pretty white.</li>
            <li>I love the original fake bake but thought I would try this out.</li>
            <li>I even measured the straw up next to the side of the bottle to make sure it was cut short enough.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my face, but since there is usually quite a bit of product on the mitt, there is no need to spray more.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s most likely due to me not exfoliating as well as I should have beforehand.</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan with no streaks!</li>
            <li>It looks SO natural, and so affordable!</li>
            <li>First time my white</li>
            <li>Looks so natural and NO STREAKS and takes NO TIME!</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>Natural, no way to overdo with color!</li>
            <li>#34;This does not turn your skin orange, you look like you just came back from the beach, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell!&amp;#34; I recieved it in the mail along with the body exfoliant, and that night I was in the bathroom with a big smile on my face getting ready to get my tan on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews for products but this stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I have used so many sunless tanners and usually give up on them after 2 or 3 uses.</li>
            <li>be aware that it will discolor your sheets and white clothes.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked at tanning salons, and been an avid tanner for the last 5-6 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and will be repurchasing as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li>This self tanner definitely smells better than any other tanner I have ever used</li>
            <li>First thing, I am pastey white.</li>
            <li>I could not love this product more</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the same odor as many other tanning products do.</li>
            <li>Only streaks if you aren&#x27;t paying attention or don&#x27;t exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>My bf, my coworkers, and my friends have all marveled at how naturally tan Fake-Bake made me!</li>
            <li>You can see this in action as you apply it, so no waiting on it to set to know where you messed up!</li>
            <li>Seemed to make me darker the first time I used it than subsequent times but goes on without streaking.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever I was actually called tan.</li>
            <li>only problem is it only last for about 3 days at the most.</li>
            <li>Second of all- the applicator that came with pilled and fell off on my bathroom floor during the first application-</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have been spray tanning (by professional) for over 8 years and costs about $50 each time!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It does have the usual odor of most products of this type, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure where you can get more .</li>
            <li>and it looks exactly like same!</li>
            <li>Using the professional mitt you get an even tan that is not in anyway orange!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I put it on before I go out and usually touch it up every 4 days or so.</li>
            <li>have keratosis pilaris on my arms (red bumps &amp;#34;acne like&amp;#34;) and I resort to tanning to help take away the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle (the first lasted over a month I think), and have learned some tricks since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this BY FAR is #1 (and inexpensive!).</li>
            <li>I was finally able to stop searching for something better after discovering Fake Bake!</li>
            <li>I do have to apply it everyday to get a half way decent color, but I am fair skinned and freckly, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Still, it was pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for me (as I am super pale)</li>
            <li>After making sure my skin was completely dry, I rubbed a small dab on Vitamin E Oil on my knee area and rubbed it in well, just to make sure they weren&#x27;t too dry.</li>
            <li>, it does dry very fast, I got a golden glow from this tanner almost instantly</li>
            <li>sure to spray almost the entire soft side of the mitt and apply in circular motions...or else the color will saturate to heavy in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I only experienced a little too much build up at my ankles and elbows a few times</li>
            <li>, I woke up with a huge streak down my arm.</li>
            <li>It usually worked out fine, and you couldn&#x27;t really tell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend pointing a fan directly at yourself or it may dry too quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells fine, lasts long enough.  </li>
            <li>it will give u a pretty decent color.for how long,</li>
            <li>I consider myself a connoisseur of fake tanning products, and this is definitely a good one, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>This goes on dry, you barely have any color come off on clothes, it smells great, and the color lasts at least a week (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>This is great for winter to give a little color without going overboard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply but even with using it daily for 10 days there was a barely noticeable change between my upper and forearm.</li>
            <li>I 100% recommend it to anyone that wants a quick long lasting tan.  </li>
            <li>Most men would never dream of using a fake tan, but I am a firm believer in looking your best year round.</li>
            <li>this self tanner gives a very natural brown tan not orange at all and my natural skin color is pretty white ..also lasts a couple days and doesn&#x27;t look streaky</li>
            <li>If you like \\&quot;Fake Bake &amp; it works &amp; looks good on YOU, then I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>(I actually just add a little cream blush on my cheeks to make it look more realistic.</li>
            <li>It may be a little more orangey than other high end tanners but it still looks fine as long as you don&#x27;t do it every day.</li>
            <li>I am hispanic and have yellow undertones, I can get pretty pasty with no tan, I just started using self tanners this summer, and this was the 2nd brand that I have tried, first of all the box, the mitt  look in no way cheap, but I paid so little for this</li>
            <li>Takes me 10 minutes tops and always looks better than being pale!</li>
            <li>This fake bake does smell nice though unlike most other self tanners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d have to reapply this at least every other day for it to stay fresh and nice looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now let me warn you, at first, you may start to see dark brown spots in areas that are a tad more callous than other areas.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is as good as it gets as far as sunless tanning goes!!</li>
            <li>So if you are pale, or use more than one squirt you may get dark quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live near the beach</li>
            <li>I still tan at the tanning, but I am using this in conjunction with the bed because I live so far</li>
            <li>as long as you do it right with the mit</li>
            <li>This is why Fake Bakke gives an amazing tan, it goes pretty</li>
            <li>You can make yourself look incredibly sun-kissed without getting melanoma or wrinkles or becoming a disgusting dragon lady or spending $40 on a spray tan that lasts 7 - 10 days.</li>
            <li>As long as you moisturize well beforehand, this self tanner will apply so smoothly and it will last for days!</li>
            <li>I really like how this is applied with a glove instead of just spraying directly onto the skin, or a lotion that you rub with your bare hands.</li>
            <li>The Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, this is half the cost and with the added advantage of seeing color immediately.</li>
            <li>smell is great too, no more harsh chemical smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it really does dry more or less</li>
            <li>It withstands a few showers and doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easy.</li>
            <li>In my experience this product, used correctly, is the most realistic artificial tan available.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel this product gives you exactly what it promises, but a word to those with sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>I developed a rash on my wrists after two applications (the first and second night</li>
            <li>No uneven lines popping up hours later;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that recently went on vacation to Miami and Vegas, and didn&#x27;t want to blind all the beautiful people with my winter paleness.</li>
            <li>If you have a medium-medium dark skin tone, go with the Fake Bake Flawless Darker.</li>
            <li>I always exfoliate and am super careful about putting on a pre-balm that helps to fight the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; around the ankles, hands, and elbows..</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t be the only one caught on the beach in the middle of July without a tan, no swirls no streaks, for a nice medium to dark tan, finally a product that really works !</li>
            <li>any color rinsing off when I shower, but the color improves after a shower, though I would definitely not hesitate to go anywhere after applying it (before showering), as it still looks pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I really love how dark it gets you and instantly!!</li>
            <li>I was SO careful just to use it super sparingly and just pass over the knees and elbows to avoid staining and</li>
            <li>I have better results with Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion - Deep Dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one that needs to tan since I already have a dark complexion, but this really comes in handy when traveling in the winter months to hotter, tropical areas where my legs need a little help with evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has a slight smell to it before you shower for the first time (like all sunless tanners) but this one is actually quite pleasant (especially compared to other products).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and so far have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>The color that developed was very natural looking</li>
            <li>Now i have been using fake tanners for years and this is hands down the best  yet !!!</li>
            <li>The only downside is it&#x27;s really intense, and easy to mess up.</li>
            <li>I love this product and they actually shipped it to me before it said it would be due!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that wants an easy cheap fake tan without looking like an ompa lumpa!</li>
            <li>Well, I have to take back a positive review that I submitted for this product a couple months ago...</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m usually very pale</li>
            <li>you are very pale, it may take up to four or five uses to get the color you desire, but this is ok for me, because I apply it in the morning until I get the color I want.</li>
            <li>It also makes a huge mess</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It got all over the sink, the wall, and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess too.  </li>
            <li>I have the applicator because it is mess free.</li>
            <li>This should take care of that minor leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone who used to frequent tanning beds in my 20&#x27;s and gave it up to avoid skin damage, I can attest to what looks like a natural golden UV tan vs. an orange monster from the tan-lagoon.</li>
            <li>My only con is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long and most of it will come off once you take a shower.  </li>
            <li>The first time I went too heavy on the knees, the second time, too light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That is really the only problem that I had with it, but to me it&#x27;s a pretty big problem!</li>
            <li>I also advise everyone to read as many tips as possible on application, trim the stem of the spray-bottle head about 1 1/2 inches prior to use to avoid leakage (it is way too long for the bottle), and wash the mitt after every</li>
            <li>This is much better then those lotions that you have to waste a lot of time rubbing it in, washing your hands every 15 seconds, and then not really knowing exactly where you put it.</li>
            <li>People complained about the straw being too long, but I trimmed a few inches off of mine and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>not bad like the other products.</li>
            <li>I have used tons of self-tanners because I am a pale redhead that burns easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird discoloration and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have used the bottle probably 6 times and there is still more than half left!</li>
            <li>9- dry off lightly, moisturize entire body.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Fake Baker for two years now, which means I&#x27;ve used probably 20 bottles of this magic stuff.</li>
            <li>No streaking, had a very lightweight feel and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>It went on simply and quickly (taking me about ten minutes to apply it feet to head).</li>
            <li>The color also starts to fade much more quick than the fake bake lotion.  </li>
            <li>The straw on the spray attachment is way to long for the bottle so naturally the screw top doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough and the bottle will actually leak.</li>
            <li>My legs were too white for me to feel comfortable wearing a skirt, so what I do when I&#x27;m in too much of a hurry to do my whole body is rub some just on my legs after getting out of the shower (just a small amount)</li>
            <li>Be completely dry when you apply and don&#x27;t go do the dishes or something right away.</li>
            <li>Best fake tanner!!</li>
            <li>I sprayed the mit over the sink and no mess!</li>
            <li>One of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t have the bad odor associated with most self tans.</li>
            <li>The color is rich, and seems to last long.</li>
            <li>I use this pretty much every other day</li>
            <li>it dried so quickly!</li>
            <li>Only positive is that when you apply it you instantly have a little more color than you did before.</li>
            <li>Definitely more than I expected, i cannot believe I have been wasting my time and money paying for airbrush tans this long!!</li>
            <li>It can only be used in certain circumstances since it rubs off everywhere before the tan develops.</li>
            <li>On certain spots I had left over Loreal self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the spray attachment because I don&#x27;t think enough comes out at once to cover certain areas.  </li>
            <li>: ANY self tanner will sweat off after application, FakeBake is just smart enough to inform you that you should apply it at night so that doesn&#x27;t happen to you.</li>
            <li>Wherever the leak is coming from, it&#x27;s large enough for water to flow</li>
            <li>I have light skin and therefore am a little nervous about putting something on that screams self tan.</li>
            <li>Pretty much spread a (dark) towel out, sit and stand on it and spray on the mitt or directly on your skin and rub into your skin!</li>
            <li>I just wish I could find somewhere to buy the application mitts for cheap because they start to fall apart after a little while.</li>
            <li>I apply a little baby oil to these rougher areas after applying the bronzer to help smooth out.</li>
            <li>the mit is a little cheap  </li>
            <li>Make sure you are careful with your hands and dry spots!  </li>
            <li>I then had to clean the bathroom walls, wipe down everything and wash my bathroom</li>
            <li>- there are many products out there which achieve the same result with less effort - and no mess.</li>
            <li>My skin time is medium beige, i&#x27;m not pale</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not pale, but doesn&#x27;t make me look dark/fake either.  </li>
            <li>In Puerto Vallarta I wanted to look &#x27;poolish&#x27;, not pale and foolish.  </li>
            <li>I break out very easily and have used a small amount of this on my face (just whatever is left on the mitt when I&#x27;m done with my body)</li>
            <li>and they look a little muddy (absorbed too much product)</li>
            <li>If I want a little more color I apply a second coat to my legs after the am shower and wear the application all day at work then shower off when I get home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then a little more the next day.  </li>
            <li>The best fake tan for coloured skin and white skin and dry skin and scarred skin!</li>
            <li>and it is very realistic, but I would much rather it last longer than my next shower.</li>
            <li>I use it along with my other tanner for quick touch ups</li>
            <li>I think this needs applied more than one time per week which makes it hard to do if you lack the time.</li>
            <li>it is hard so for me an aerosol can  spray tan works better for me.  </li>
            <li>I worked my magic, and had The Hubbs help get the hard to reach areas (heehee.)  </li>
            <li>I slept with it on overnight, only a little bit rinsed off but left no streaks just a nice tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all as easy to apply as the original fake bake.</li>
            <li>It is hard to see on the back of your legs, but it goes on nicely with the glove.  </li>
            <li>And when you get your new bottle, switch the nozzles to the new bottle or cut the extra off on the new bottle.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake the best self tanner hands down !  </li>
            <li>And the only one that looks very Natural!!</li>
            <li>I works brilliantly and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not smell bad, it smells great!</li>
            <li>one is not so bad and not as messy.&lt;br /&gt;The color is better than the orange look so many give you.</li>
            <li>I have used a few self tanning products but none compare to this one, no more sun for me - this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>And out of the few brands of fake tan stuff I&#x27;ve tried this smells the best.</li>
            <li>I was really worried at first because it goes on really dark.</li>
            <li>I personally think that she could do without it, but it makes her happy and doesn&#x27;t look to fake.  </li>
            <li>this product is okay, not really what I expected.</li>
            <li>lol I was streaky and blotchy and will definitely go this Fake Bake route again.</li>
            <li>It sprayed on clear (just like water).</li>
            <li>You can clearly see where the product is going when you rub it on so</li>
            <li>The regular Fake Bake did a great job</li>
            <li>Now I am 20yrs old, and I do have sensitive skin on my face, however I would never consider that the skin on the rest of my body is sensitive.</li>
            <li>You really need to apply this at night and wash off the tint the next morning to reveal the natural color that is underneath it.  </li>
            <li>Fake bake is a great product, for a simple tan.</li>
            <li>You could see where I placed the sticker clear as day after I tanned</li>
            <li>Once the water ran clear, I exited the shower and used a towel to pat-dry my legs.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel extremely soft, and not sticky or itchy.</li>
            <li>SINCE I HAD NO NOZZLE I resorted to just pouring it directly on the mitt</li>
            <li>This stuff actually made me look like I had a real tan.</li>
            <li>Iook orange looks natural</li>
            <li>I prepped my skin by taking a shower and using dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar of soap.</li>
            <li>However, I developed a rash that began on my wrists, but extended all the way up my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>When I wake up and shower, the excess color DOES comes off, BUT it does leave a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with cautious optimism and looked at it for 3 months because in case 2,000 people lied, I didn&#x27;t really feel like buying Comet in bulk and the possibility of being housebound in oompa-loompa shame for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural looking and not at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks completely natural and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Amazing, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>You just spray the tanner onto the provided soft mitt and rub it in.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>was white hahaha.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells and this does not bother me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking professional airbrush tan.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So applying it before you sleep really does help the product seep into your skin and thus last longer!</li>
            <li>The directions say to apply spray onto your mitt, which is included in your kit, but I applied it directly to my.skin, and just rubbed on a circular motion  </li>
            <li>The color looks so natural, but I did apply it 2 days in a row, because I wanted to have a darker color.</li>
            <li>It does not by any means look like i just came home from a tropical vacation, but it gives my skin natural color</li>
            <li>I cut the straw on the spray attachment to fit the bottle before I inserted it, and I had no problems with any sort of messy application.  </li>
            <li>I used the gloves, sprayed two sprays directly into the glove and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li>Looks really natural.  </li>
            <li>My least favorite tanner.</li>
            <li>One day early too.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest of them all to apply with the mitt.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a tan without going to the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it by spraying it directly on the skin and by spraying it on the glove...</li>
            <li>and i looked like i had a natural tan.</li>
            <li>I spray directly onto the mitt and apply.</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan too.</li>
            <li>Natural tan look.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t want to get much darker than maybe after tonight&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;professional&#x27; mitt that it comes with starts flaking/shedding within a couple uses.</li>
            <li>It is so natural looking.  </li>
            <li>A tan so natural</li>
            <li>I am a 20 yr old guy and it has always taken a lot of sun to get my skin tan.</li>
            <li>I will be wearing a gown exposing my arms, back, shoulder, and chest ( not too much).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Similar to painting, if you get too eager and apply too much at once, you&#x27;ll develop streaks.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin when I&#x27;m tan, so I try to go for the natural brown and</li>
            <li>The combination of the gloves and mit completely prevents my hands from staining.</li>
            <li>It takes only about five minutes to apply over the whole body.</li>
            <li>It fades naturally, it has a bit of an odor, any tanner that claims it doesn&#x27;t is lying.  </li>
            <li>I am low key addicted to it because I don&#x27;t need to wear makeup anymore, and it doesnt cause cancer LOL.</li>
            <li>The tan looks natural and lasts.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural.</li>
            <li>so there were no uneven spots of color.</li>
            <li>If you follow basic self tanner 101 rules (exfoliate, bend elbows, etc), you should really like this too.</li>
            <li>Smells very tropical when I apply it, but 6 hours later</li>
            <li>I have to give it overnight to take action, then wash off the color guide before I want to be seen.</li>
            <li>and it gives you a natural color within minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned girl of Norwegian descent</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t believe me because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this over real tanning.  </li>
            <li>this did not look natural.</li>
            <li>, this was far and away the easiest self tanner to apply.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t quite as natural as I thought</li>
            <li>it was absolutely natural looking.</li>
            <li>Plus this one bottle will probably last me through the whole summer</li>
            <li>It does rub off a bit on your clothes but it completely washes out.</li>
            <li>The color develops almost immediately and is a natural color, not orangy.  </li>
            <li>Goes on without streaking, looks natural, smells somewhat tropical.  </li>
            <li>Has a natural tan color, no orange color at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone who does not want to lay in the sun for the natural tan.  </li>
            <li>this tanner mimicks my natural color after some sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times over about two months and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in what I received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times over about two months and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in what I received.</li>
            <li>My tan came out looking so natural</li>
            <li>also want to note, that this is a professional product and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>so I have to wonder why they didn&#x27;t just make both sides of the soft surface.  </li>
            <li>It looks SO natural on them both and never looks orange.</li>
            <li>This is a red based tanner which mimics a real tan, even for olive tones.</li>
            <li>I put this in my suitcase and it managed to get through two direct flights with no accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this looks natural on me.</li>
            <li>and this gave me a wonderfully natural, non-streaky color.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>(I think that means I&#x27;m a naturally orange-tan person?).</li>
            <li>The color fades like a natural tan would, no scales or patches.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>But so far I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to use tanning beds or a crappy self tanner that turns you orange.</li>
            <li>Not so much that you get no color, but enough that I need to use it three days in a row before I get the color</li>
            <li>Big and soaks up the pee without much odor</li>
            <li>Over all I do have young looking skin</li>
            <li>Gives that natural tan glow.</li>
            <li>the most common are your elbows, toes/ankles, wrists, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li>I also spray directly on my skin instead of on the mitt</li>
            <li>Looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a med/fair tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sprayed directly onto the skin then smoothed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>people say that it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that using this on your face is a breeze and thus far it hasn&#x27;t made my acne-prone skin break out at all.</li>
            <li>Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and had such high hopes for it based off all the reviews!</li>
            <li>I have some color in my skin naturally</li>
            <li>but I tend to get really pasty during the winter and this product totally solves my problem!</li>
            <li>If your sensitive to smells don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues.</li>
            <li>Looks totally natural and no tan lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You spray directly where you want the product then use the mit to apply in a streakless fashion.</li>
            <li>Natural glow</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering if this works, it does and it gives you a natural brown tan we all want to achieve.</li>
            <li>It says to use the soft side which I assumed was the brown side.</li>
            <li>I used the product on the brown side and ended up with completely brown fingers.</li>
            <li>The product was complete liquid.</li>
            <li>As a busy Mom of 3boys...</li>
            <li>My Korean mom used to call it \\&quot;shining\\&quot; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li>Product gives a natural tan, even after 1 application.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Jergens Natural Glow (I like the face one</li>
            <li>I woke up and showered leaving a completely natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I got a bowl of sugar and took it to the shower prior to applying, mixing it with my soap and a wash cloth to exfoliate as you don&#x27;t want anything that contains oils to exfoliate because it will block the tanner from absorbing.</li>
            <li>Waited till that dried and sprayed the fake bake rubbed in and cont to spray alot more than I would have liked in hopes for some color.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, last a couple days.then</li>
            <li>So be aware of that if you&#x27;re taking a long trip.</li>
            <li>my fav sunless tanner thus far</li>
            <li>It has a very tropical scent, however eventually (an hour or two later), the stinky self-tanning scent emerges.  </li>
            <li>natural looking tan no orange looking skin.</li>
            <li>three girls at work tried it we were all pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>You can see the tan immediately and after a couple of applications, you will look as though you have been tanning naturally for months.</li>
            <li>But the darker color dosent look natural on me.</li>
            <li>This product gives me a natural tan that does not look orange.</li>
            <li>Looked amazingly natural.</li>
            <li>It lasts, it does not streak and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Back to the real tan for me.</li>
            <li>Looks natural on.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray directly onto your body.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>do not look natural.</li>
            <li>My only caution is that you need to keep applying or the color fades fast.</li>
            <li>I have used alot of self tanners and so far this is number one on my list.</li>
            <li>It delivers really natural color that doesn&#x27;t flake or look orange.</li>
            <li>Leaves natural glow and&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t  </li>
            <li>It turns to a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wanna be one of those old ladies with leather for skin.</li>
            <li>The mitt helps it go on seamlessly.</li>
            <li>But the color on your skin is natural and the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li>I spray the tanner directly on my skin instead of on the mitt.  </li>
            <li>No heavy self tanner smell.  </li>
            <li>You look like you have a natural tan.</li>
            <li>Gives an even and natural glow</li>
            <li>It does not streak and looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>The color is natural looking &amp; not orange like some.  </li>
            <li>During your first shower you will notice some of the tanning spray wash off, but definitely not completely.</li>
            <li>so I wake up with a natural, bronze glow.  </li>
            <li>- I just spritz about 5 times directly onto the mitt for each arm, e.g.)</li>
            <li>- once I got to that point, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to touch up my color for nearly a week.</li>
            <li>Natural color.</li>
            <li>It looked like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>The color just didn&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li>The color is natural and bronze.</li>
            <li>Everyone is surprised when I tell them I use a self tanner because it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried these types of products before for weddings and the colors have never been natural</li>
            <li>natural looking tan, no orangy glow&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone that wants a self tanner that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>Only 1 person straight up looked me in the eye&#x27;s and said &amp;#34;Fake Bake?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in one day asked what product I used because it looked so natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>I love the coconut smell - doesn&#x27;t have that icky sunless tanner smell they often have.</li>
            <li>This is closest to a real tan that I have come across in a topical application form.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;ve used all types of self tanning products...</li>
            <li>tan looks natural.</li>
            <li>I try to tan the old fashion way but living in the Pacific Northwest</li>
            <li>both give natural looking results.</li>
            <li>I marked off one star for the mitt.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural</li>
            <li>but once it dries it does not get on any clothing I have found so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It washes completely out of your sheets and clothes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t spray directly to the body (as it will color your floors)</li>
            <li>* Spray directly on mitt IN THE SINK</li>
            <li>: Take off the mitt, spray 1 or 2x directly to gloved palms, rub hands together and apply to face and ears.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;I do spray directly on my skin, and I have not have an \\&quot;orange\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li>It lasted me about a month of use and took about a week to 10 days to completely fade after I ran out.  </li>
            <li>She was so surprised the tan was from a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>once I feel it looks totally naturally</li>
            <li>and I actually have a real tan.</li>
            <li>The included plastic gloves and soft mitt makes application a breeze.  </li>
            <li>; it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all..and</li>
            <li>Looks natural and lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;Billie</li>
            <li>The skin so soft helps with even application and absorption.</li>
            <li>before I applied this stuff I read the negative reviews and mostly said no color</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened the bottle to see it so runny and was concerned.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin so two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not a heavy Bath and Body Works coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>Even if you just get red it will really make</li>
            <li>In some places I did, spray directly on my legs and chest and then spread around.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may very well need to use this self tanner daily.</li>
            <li>I am still experimenting with that: maybe I would get a longer lasting tan if I sprayed a lot onto my skin versus the amount I use now, which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>it looks so natural and no one can believe it&#x27;s from a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every self tanner on the market, this one worked well.</li>
            <li>STAYS SOFT.</li>
            <li>ANYWAYS, I USE JERGENS NATURAL TANNER IN MEDIUM BEFORE I APPLY THIS, MAKES IT EASIER TO SPREAD, ALSO I SPRAY ON MY BODY NOT THE GLOVE.</li>
            <li>And it comes with a professional mitt that makes no streaks at all.</li>
            <li>NATURAL looking color (not even a tint of orange)</li>
            <li>I really like it overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;(30 years old, pasty irish/ northern Minnesotan skin tone)</li>
            <li>It washed away naturally</li>
            <li>This product works well and has a natural color.</li>
            <li>I recommend Jergens natural glow</li>
            <li>Smells like tropical bliss and absolutely none of that gross self tanner smell.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it requires a heck of a lot of work for the color your skin turns.  </li>
            <li>home mom, in my early 30&#x27;s with kids.</li>
            <li>It leaves no streaks at all and stays on for a considerable amount of time.</li>
            <li>my 6 year old son said, you look amazing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like that it has an instant bronzer (that acts as an indicator)</li>
            <li>but I found that the mit absorbs a lot of it before it reaches your skin, so it&#x27;s easiest to spray it directly onto your skin instead and then rub it in from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE</li>
            <li>sometimes spray directly on my body and then rub it in with the mitt.</li>
            <li>natural looking tan - doesn&#x27;t make you look orange</li>
            <li>It goes on effortlessly with the mitt...and Never streaky and just natural color results .</li>
            <li>I am verrrrrrry sensitive to smell and almost everything gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li>, It looks natural too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am 21 and was completely hooked on tanning beds from age 15..</li>
            <li>she was surprised how well the color looked.</li>
            <li>, I feel like if I really want to maintain a deep color I have to apply every two days.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I wish I had not wasted my money.</li>
            <li>No waiting until morning to have that natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>Oh, did I say natural looking?  </li>
            <li>Ive tried nearly every lotion and potion on the market to try and get a natural looking faux-tan</li>
            <li>Not blochy looks natural</li>
            <li>This product works so gradually that you have a chance to correct any areas that look too light or heavy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am the lightest shade they make and this looks natural on me, not orange.</li>
            <li>The brown-ish guide paint stuff also adhered really well and didn&#x27;t come off until I showered the next day.  </li>
            <li>, I found this to be the easiest tanner to use so far</li>
            <li>This way my face is not uneven, and I can use my moisturizers and do my nightly routine with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And looks so natural</li>
            <li>The color it gives you is so natural and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d prefer it as a 1 complete product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for a younger person with darker features ( brunette) that has very moist skin...</li>
            <li>The mitt is soft, and I use it about twice before I just throw it in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>Not as natural as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the sensitive skin on my face can break out after using this,</li>
            <li>I spray it directly on my skin AND on the mitt and buff it evenly into any part of your body that you want to tan.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and sprayed it directly on the mitt provided.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I really wish you got a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>No streaks and the color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this, and would definitely refer and buy this product again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old with skin that has been weather in Florida for well......</li>
            <li>I am always going to the tanning beds, and pay $40 every two weeks for a tech to professionally spray me.</li>
            <li>The color looks natural and not orange-looking.</li>
            <li>The color is natural looking and not orange.</li>
            <li>I coat feet, hands and rough patches on my knees with moisturizer prior to Fake Bake to achieve perfect results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any streaks and it is a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I always use the  mitt and it produces a natural looking, non-streaky tan.</li>
            <li>and they have to be applied frequently to maintain it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking maybe I received an old product??</li>
            <li>It lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I used it and 2 days later, I noticed I was really itchy, could not figure out what caused it.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>I do now use it by spraying the solution directly onto the mit THEN rubbing it in to my skin</li>
            <li>So I guess until someone comes up with a monthly application I will have to just learn to deal with the frequent applications.  </li>
            <li>I am now over 30 years old and realize I need to stop using them</li>
            <li>Natural color, may not be</li>
            <li>but after I read the reviews on how natural the tan looks</li>
            <li>I had a natural brown tan, and when it began to fade</li>
            <li>I just sprayed directly on my skin and blended with the glove.  </li>
            <li>Really works, and a bottle last for a month or 2 of tans.</li>
            <li>This product has the conveience of doing it yourself at home but with the coverage of a professional spray application.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve showered, it looks really natural and not orange-y at all.</li>
            <li>5- spray directly on arms, legs, body and rub in one section at a time.</li>
            <li>I actually look like I have a real tan, like</li>
            <li>(I could never achieve a tan naturally</li>
            <li>It gives a natural, brown glow.</li>
            <li>but after the shower in the morning every time I have used it I have been pleasantly surprised that every time it has come out even on my skin.</li>
            <li>No streaks , very even color , last about 6 times I used every 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone whos looking for a natural way to tan</li>
            <li>I thought the spray looked natural</li>
            <li>Naturally some color was lost in the shower the morning after</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about this product is that you can see the color instantly.</li>
            <li>The box came COMPLETELY torn up and everything was just stuffed in the box.</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>Blends into the skin well and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>Take long hot shower and exfoliate your skin  2.</li>
            <li>Have used on my chin to cover a spot too, but sparingly to blend in color, and still use the coloration liquid for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>no matter what I can&#x27;t get it to go on completely evenly.</li>
            <li>Not recommended;the product is not hypoallergenic so if you have a sensitive skin it could be a problem.</li>
            <li>she used a self-tanner,  because it looked so natural.  </li>
            <li>The tan looks so natural</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve already bought 4 bottles so far</li>
            <li>get compliments all the time on my tan and how natural it is.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it fades really fast</li>
            <li>my 10 year old asked what smelled like sunblock so...).</li>
            <li>I do not have an orange hue, but a natural bronze...</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>Put an old sheet/towel on the floor before applying.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised about this product.</li>
            <li>This product gives you a very natural-looking tan and is a terrific price compared to getting a spray-tan at a salon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a lot of work, when you don&#x27;t have naturally</li>
            <li>The color is so natural looking, I&#x27;m a bronzed beauty with this product.</li>
            <li>When I plan on wearing shorts/dress it, I apply this the night before because I&#x27;m very self-conscious about my white legs.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m at the ripe old age of 34.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t noticeable from far away</li>
            <li>Do not spray directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>does not make you look orange and works wonders on and around the foot area which is one of the hardest to look natural.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>The balm is like a wax, and you apply it after the tanner to blend the color, or before it to block it completely.</li>
            <li>today i did try a lil on my hand and so far i like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 6 times so far</li>
            <li>and I spray directly on the mitt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen that looks so natural even around the feet and hands.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li>Natural look and none of the funky smell.  </li>
            <li>it gives you a natural tan look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what my natural skin color is anymore</li>
            <li>Unless the bottle is completely unopened.</li>
            <li>, I suspect it&#x27;s because I exfoliate it frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tan is natural to my color - looks</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not heavy or stinky.</li>
            <li>I have used this three times so far but am still getting the hang of the application.</li>
            <li>I can be really sensitive to alot of products.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>BUT THEN IT MAY NOT LOOK AS NATURAL OR LAY ON SKIN OR PORES</li>
            <li>I suggest this to anyone who wants an instant even all over tan!</li>
            <li>and I do not think organic or natural at all.</li>
            <li>just I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while and so natural..</li>
            <li>Natural color.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive either.</li>
            <li>And its still too early for laying out at the creek or the pool</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this enough - it really is foolproof.</li>
            <li>I think people look healthier with a modest dose of color on them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and mine is not longer soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray directly onto my body.</li>
            <li>Seeing all those patients having skin cancer surgeries and seeing so much prematurely aging skin scared the sense into me, and I am now a dilligent daily sunscreen user.</li>
            <li>Goes on even and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last a long time if that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>The next day I applied it again at night, and the color once again looked good, but after showering again, I was left once again with blotchy, icky looking color.</li>
            <li>I love that it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and dried almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>I was too, but with such a low price it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I used it more than a few times to try to give it a second chance, and I even had my sister, who is a cosmetologist, and my mother, who is a licensed esthetician, apply the self tanner for me.</li>
            <li>Not a big drawback, as I should be following those golden rules regardless.</li>
            <li>my favorite for the past fews years has been Bare Essentials ...</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning sunkissed and golden and not even remotely orange.</li>
            <li>My issue is that it sinks into each and every hair follicle (on freshly shaved and exfoliated legs.)</li>
            <li>I feel like I finally found the best secret to staying tan all year round without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>SURE WY PEOPLE SAY ITS MESSY, I DIDNT GET IT ON ANYTHING, SIMPLY AIM AND SPRAY CLOSE</li>
            <li>The color was good, but it did not go on evenly and it sunk into my pores and made them look weird.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect, but as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad at all either since it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, like tropical tanning lotion, not some weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is a good product</li>
            <li>Not perfect but good.</li>
            <li>decided to test drive this product this summer, before I go to Hawaii in the winter, to give myself time to find a good fake tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a good experience with Fake Bake products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for fake tans.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it works the best if you already have a base tan,</li>
            <li>Even though the reviews were good, I was still skeptical ,as I am of any self tanning product.  </li>
            <li>It develops more slowly, but tends to stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and 57 and hav tried a variety of fake tans before.</li>
            <li>twins age 4 and a Sweet new little one of one month</li>
            <li>You may get a little pink on your light colored clothing or bedding, but it washes right out.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell (with little to no self-tanner smell that usually lingers hours after applying the product).</li>
            <li>Dries very fast, once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>have pretty pale skin and during the winter i can get pretty pasty</li>
            <li>the tan doesn&#x27;t last a super long time but it only takes me 5 minutes to apply it to my whole body evenly</li>
            <li>It was a mess to clean up and not with my time.</li>
            <li>I will probably go to the original during the summer when I am naturally tan and want to be a little darker.</li>
            <li>This provided me with an instant golden brown tan, it was easy to apply, very little odor, dries quickly &amp; lasts a few days!</li>
            <li>I also suggest having someone there to do your back because right now I have a big gap of space where I could not reach.</li>
            <li>It comes out super dark but looks so natural if you apply correctly.</li>
            <li>It goes on dark, evenly, dries quickly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>AT ALL, NICE AND BROWN NOT SUPER DARK..</li>
            <li>Really though, i&#x27;ve purchased quite a few other tanners, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have zero patience and after the first application I noticed I have to take my time and be a little more thorough in coverage, as I did get a little streaky.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, you will have a hot mess!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy Fake Bake again, other than the bottle leaking, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to apply but worth it!</li>
            <li>Just more expensive, but that is probably due to better packaging.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer came right off and the amount was minimal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to let it sit on my hands for very long because they darkened the fastest even spraying the liquid on the glove first.</li>
            <li>Getting your skin wet in any other way (especially pools) will take it right off and make light spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works, doesn&#x27;t cost a ton like other brands &amp;#60;which is a huge plus to me!&amp;#62; I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>and it usually goes on really easily.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliate first, with a dry brush for example.  </li>
            <li>I bought the dry oil smoothie as well and apply to knees and elbows first.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to blend it in with your lotion and apply it that way or apply lotion first so it won&#x27;t instantly dry and streak.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that much better than other self tanners I have tried.</li>
            <li>The spray and mitt don&#x27;t really do it for me, it was just a hot mess</li>
            <li>I was pretty much dry by the time I was done</li>
            <li>/&gt;Put a moisturizer on your knees &amp; elbows first, then let dry.</li>
            <li>It took me 1/10th the time to do a full body tan, compared my previous experiences.</li>
            <li>its a quick fix if u put some garnier bb cream in medium dark on when doing ur makeup.</li>
            <li>with this stuff it turns a super dark brown.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it wears off pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m crazy fair), quick dry time</li>
            <li>would be super dark.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything that made me look super dark.</li>
            <li>It does not give me that super dark look but</li>
            <li>Slight smell but not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to apply than the lotions or wipes, because you can pretty much see what and where it&#x27;s going at the time of application, you don&#x27;t get that next morning wake-up surprise, strips down your legs!  </li>
            <li>I have used the Banana Boat Deep Dark self-tanning lotion, which gives a nice tan, but I always had to wipe the excess off my toes, ankles, and heels, and no matter what time I applied it, I found that it would wear off unevenly while I slept through the night just from being in contact with the sheets and tossing and turning throughout the night, it would also collect in one area on my shin, which looked really patchy and orange.</li>
            <li>It only last about 3-4 days at the most, but I have to put it on about 3-4 days in a row just to get it to last that long and keep the color that I want.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is so easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t leave you skin smelling as self tanner which is something I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li>You can clearly see a noticeable, yet subtle, layer of shading go over your skin that guides you to where you need to blend or apply more.</li>
            <li>It left me with a slight orange look and wasn&#x27;t that easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>Blue is the most coarse, green is medium, pink is mild coarseness.  </li>
            <li>Dry brushing thoroughly prior to entering the shower is also adequate exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very important to wash the mitt as well, the tanning product may cause it to dry weird (with the fibers standing up) and it isn&#x27;t a smooth application, plus a lot of the product remains in the mitt.</li>
            <li>I got this to help my extreme pale skin and it gave me a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is incredible and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants a natural looking fake bake.</li>
            <li>It is a little long and can cause oozing out of the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I had a really great experience with Fake Bake the first time I tried it a few summers ago.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate, use barrier cream on your rough spots, apply in natural light and leave on as long as you can before rinsing</li>
            <li>I had no mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this wins over all ..</li>
            <li>ok, so all of the spray tans promise &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; results but seasoned shoppers are always skeptical, because (lets face it) there is nothing natural in a bottle of chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no mess.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake gives me a nice golden color, with no streaks as long as you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>Okay, just started using it, but am VERY PLEASED with the results, AND it&#x27;s stupid simple to apply.  </li>
            <li>You can not mess this up.</li>
            <li>No mess and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>If you do that, there&#x27;s no mess.  </li>
            <li>The red calms down and the end result color was fine.</li>
            <li>Where has this been all my precious pale life!!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to sit down for a little bit ( because I&#x27;m paranoid), but I could put clothes on like 5 minutes after application honestly.</li>
            <li>The others were aerosole and made a complete mess out of my entire bathroom, and the lotions I was more likely to get streaks or my palms and in between fingers all stained.</li>
            <li>I will say I had high hopes for this product, and I was let down, AT FIRST.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a new fanatic on using Fake Bake Flawless tanning lotion no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and pretty much foolproof with the mitt and gives dramatic instant results.</li>
            <li>I found a much better product with longer lasting results, less smell and cheaper at the local Sally Beauty</li>
            <li>The big issue I have with this is that it washes off easily (even after 6 hours) leaving only minimal change in skin tone.</li>
            <li>One spritz per area gives me a subtle healthy glow.</li>
            <li>because taking some toilet paper and gently wiping my skin seemed to get them off without affecting the color.</li>
            <li>I wash it in hot water and then lay it out to dry!</li>
            <li>the backs of my ankles looked ridiculous :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using fake bake products and I love the fact that it has a color guide to show me the places I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Jergens self tanning products in the past and think i will go back to that because it&#x27;s more gradual.  </li>
            <li>and I quit because I pretty much had to tan everyday</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that the mitten fell apart first use and left brown residue all over body.</li>
            <li>In order to maintain a decent level of tan, I find myself applying this product daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;-I never trusted Original on my face due to the thickness and deep color it had.</li>
            <li>I Love it and would definitely recommend it to friends who are not able to go to a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>They literally are the same exact product I see 0 difference in any aspect of the product between the two besides it actually being darker.</li>
            <li>The tan begins to fade after the first shower, but I only noticed the fading after about 5 days from patches of color on my inner arm.</li>
            <li>And is such a decent price.</li>
            <li>you only have to apply once a week to maintain after the first initial days.</li>
            <li>Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 totally helped with the first goal, but that&#x27;s a totally separate review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>im tan in places that usually don&#x27;t tan well, such as my face, and the color is totally believable without being streaky.</li>
            <li>There is no better product I have tried so many and have always come back to this formula</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky like the other self tanners.</li>
            <li>It is safe to say that I&#x27;m pretty much obsessed with this product...</li>
            <li>I have used many tanning sprays and lotions in the past, all of which left my streaked and orange.</li>
            <li>Fake bake flawless self tanner was the biggest waste of time of my life!</li>
            <li>Now I can tan, look natural and not dry out my skin!!!  </li>
            <li>The spray is super easy but a little messy!  </li>
            <li>(St. Moriz Dark Mousse), is that it is so easy to apply and dries so fast that as soon as I set down the bottle and wash the mitt, I can go get dressed.</li>
            <li>i opened it, used it for one application, closed everything off and by the morning the bottom of the box, and the top of the cap was soaked through, leaking down the bottle</li>
            <li>Also, it was easy to apply without blotches near my ankles, toes, or any other dry areas!</li>
            <li>However, like many people in the comments note, the product doesn&#x27;t last as long as other sunless tanners without maintenence.</li>
            <li>The color is instant and very natural (with no glitter)!</li>
            <li>They give you a cool little glove too, I&#x27;m assuming to slap people with</li>
            <li>It really digs into large pores, though, so it&#x27;s hard to apply to the face because you can&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>And unlike other sprays or foams, you see right away where the product has been applied so you can get an even coating.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who needs that extra glow!</li>
            <li>Even the high pressure beds with only UV-A rays are still damaging.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>With high chances of skin cancer in my family, this is the only way I will ever look tan!</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>I would notice some color come off in the bottom of the shower, even the next day, so I avoided using it in high humidity</li>
            <li>For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually.</li>
            <li>For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>But overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I had such high hopes...crushed.</li>
            <li>Everyone still remembers that embarrassing day from back in high school when I showed up to school looking like an oompa loompa.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and works well, just doesn&#x27;t get very dark, even after multiple applications.</li>
            <li>so much so that I thought the new pink colored mitt was bleeding dye</li>
            <li>Who in their right mind wants to look green?!</li>
            <li>The only reasons that I would not give it 5 stars is because it rubs off very easily on clothing, sheets and towels long after it has dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Clings to pores like no other!</li>
            <li>Do NOT attempt to rub it in with bare hands!!</li>
            <li>After a few days it did start to rub off - but it was more when my skin was dry and got flaky, or if I exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>Self tanners concentrate more in dry areas with dead skin.</li>
            <li>spray the tan from a few inches away directly on my skin and quickly blend in circular motions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, nasty odor like most self-tanners, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and it lasts with a rich brown NOT orange color.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it was so watered down resulted in a unexpected spill  ALL over the floor (ran right off the mitt) .</li>
            <li>I am a VERY pale woman who has tried many different self-tanners.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by stating I have very pale, fair skin with trouble tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked at a tanning salon and gotten free mystic sprays for the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I tan, but it takes a long time, and I never get very tan unless I spend a ton of time in the sun (which I refuse to do).  </li>
            <li>The color looks so real and stays for long.</li>
            <li>it went on fast 15 minuits and two hours later I was actually looking like I had a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It deepens your color instantly, its mess free with the provided mitt, and it fades evenly.</li>
            <li>And the whole bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is great for an instant tan and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross fake tan smell.</li>
            <li>You will notice that its much too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li>someone that usually uses light tanners is used to.</li>
            <li>I suspect it does not matter as long as you apply evenly all over, and very well on knees, feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so depending how much comes off I will reapply and see how long the color lasts.</li>
            <li>The next day it does begin to have the normal self tanner smell.</li>
            <li>Gave me the bronzed look I would get normally by laying out after several weeks.</li>
            <li>but I am not dark.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different spray tans, with moderate success.</li>
            <li>I am Greek and normally have medium tone skin</li>
            <li>For reference i am NC40-42 in mac which is not a dark skintone to beging with.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s tailored to my exact skin tone because I look the way I do after I&#x27;ve spent a week at the beach (without the sunburn)</li>
            <li>It can rub off on clothes until your first shower, so be careful.</li>
            <li>No dark spots,</li>
            <li>Later when you shower it off you&#x27;ll still have some color but not as dark as you originally applied it.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it the smell is not intense but after sleeping in it over night it is smelly.</li>
            <li>Works flawlessly not as dark as I hoped but still the smoothness and evenness makes up for it.</li>
            <li>At first this was extremely alarming...</li>
            <li>then I am back to my normal color.</li>
            <li>I was careful putting this for the first time</li>
            <li>Lastly: after the other night i sprayed only my legs: most of it washed off the next day</li>
            <li>I put this on and yes, compared to a normal person I am still white</li>
            <li>its not crazy dark</li>
            <li>The mitt itself is poor quality and has a soft side which you spray the tanning formula onto and a rough side which does not feel good against your skin.  </li>
            <li>But no matter how good the product, a fake tan never hides the flaws or glows from deep within the skin like a natural tan</li>
            <li>have been using different tanning products for years, everything from L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (which I was vaguely favorable to), MysticTan, VersaSpa (good in a crunch, but not at the eleventh hour), and Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
            <li>It even looks natural if you are super pale.  </li>
            <li>This was a watered down version of what I have used in the past, and love!</li>
            <li>I had to travel for wedding, and I took the advise of other users when I received it and cut the pump tube down to the appropriate length for the bottle.</li>
            <li>Overall, good for winter if you are pale, but any other time I feel it would not be enough.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of lasting color, I&#x27;m not as ghostly pale as before I use it, but I was hoping it would last more than</li>
            <li>when applying it is not that dark so as you rub it in you can&#x27;t tell where you have missed or applied too much to one particular area</li>
            <li>I just took so paper towel and wiped on my arms to get the rest of the initial color dried off and everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend exfoliating first and applying small layers daily instead of too much at one time.</li>
            <li>I kept going back over certain areas thinking that I didn&#x27;t get enough coverage, then I thought,</li>
            <li>mit is a little flimsy and cheap and it&#x27;s starting to fray a bit after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it for a little extra color.</li>
            <li>&quot; after it&#x27;s been on my skin for a little while, but fake-bake has the most minimal \\&quot;self-tanner smell\\&quot; of any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>However, it is hard to apply to the face with that large mitt, and it definitely makes the pores more noticeable - need to include a smaller facial applier!  </li>
            <li>I do not tan simply because I prefer to keep my skin cancer and wrinkle free as long as possible, especially since skin cancer runs in the family</li>
            <li>This is instant, which I love, and if you go dark enough it will last about 6 days.  </li>
            <li>Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.  </li>
            <li>I love the color before you wash it off, but could hardly tell I applied anything after showering...and that&#x27;s after leaving it on overnight and applying it several times.</li>
            <li>Self tanners really have come a long way!</li>
            <li>Another important fact, why air brush your entire body for an event if you are not going to a pool party or other event where you are not exposing your entire body.</li>
            <li>I received the new package the very next day.</li>
            <li>So you get a new mitt every time you buy this product and the mitt lasts through the use of the entire 6 ounces.</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California, so</li>
            <li>my beingwhite is only a concern when I travel out of where I live.</li>
            <li>it didnt transfer onto my new white sheets either!!!</li>
            <li>I became concerned about using tanning beds and live in a rural area</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be that I did not like the way it went on my hands, however I am new to using this</li>
            <li>Its def something buildable not a golden tan right away</li>
            <li>I have used tanning booths, every self tanner on the market, and expensive salon sprays, and this offers amazing results.</li>
            <li>The only fake tan I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my porcelain skin bright orange.</li>
            <li>Not Loving it so far-&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to put on for even coverage.  </li>
            <li>Once dry, it doesn&#x27;t really rub off or streak either..</li>
            <li>the tanner is dry on my whole body I get dressed in my pjs and go to sleep.</li>
            <li>(shower, dry off really well, lotion elbows, sides of feet, palms, and exfoliate).</li>
            <li>Because this is not a lotion, you need to be very mindful of exfoliating and applying lotion to dry areas-</li>
            <li>and I tan easily but don&#x27;t want the negative effects of UV rays.</li>
            <li>It was easy application and my tan was tan not the least bit orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last long after using it the first week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the included blue gloves, and really don&#x27;t think they are necessary.</li>
            <li>Do several light coats over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>After finally outgrowing the need for a damaging real tan, I have tried numerous sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>It really is a 2 person job, especially for your back.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long, and if you keep reapplying, obviously, lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really fond of this product mine was very liquidy and messy..</li>
            <li>The mitt that comes with this and the fast drying formula makes it possible to have an all over body tan in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Well I ordered this like normal and the first thing I noticed was 2 things were missing.</li>
            <li>I really like the color this gives, but I will not repurchase, since I had to religiously apply, since it does not seem to last.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is that it didn&#x27;t really work on my stomach or lower back?</li>
            <li>As of now I am using it about once a week to maintain a light color, but may try a few coats later in the summer for a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish there was more product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I actually much prefer the type of tan I get from this product over the occasional spray tans I get at a local spa/salon.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, as long as you exfoliate properly, this gives you a pretty all over tan.  </li>
            <li>I am a regular spray tanner which will last so much longer.  </li>
            <li>* Gently pat the mitt on the back of hands and wrists then rub back of hands together.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to moisturize on days you arent using fake bake, it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of lotions and creams of all sorts, but all got me itching like a maniac by the end of the day (sometimes even the hour), and didn&#x27;t work for me that much in terms of an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As the day wore on it developed that same old self-tanner smell (maybe it is just a &#x27;skin-turning-darker&#x27; smell?).</li>
            <li>I really like this product for the simple fact that it tans you instantly and does not rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m not happy and will continue my search for a more natural tanner.</li>
            <li>Only complaint I have is that most washes off after one shower and all off within 2-3 showers.</li>
            <li>I does last a pretty long time, too.  </li>
            <li>It does rub off on clothes some (even after showering), so do not wear white or a light color a few days after.</li>
            <li>When they got stained, I noticed that the stains were more red than orange, which is why it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a carrot, in my opinion at least.</li>
            <li>It does occasionally come out splotchy, which you can really see when you go outside.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to the spray ones though since that allows me to spray my back, and this doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never quite sure how much to spray on the mitt and it&#x27;s difficult to not get streaks when rubbing in the product.  </li>
            <li>I just received this today and I tested it out on my stomach and it dried quickly I did everything correctly.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly.</li>
            <li>do love the color this gives my skin, although i prefer the results of St. Tropez more (note: I do not prefer the smell, annoying transfer to all clothes and anything you touch, etc, of St. Tropez</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from a pasty white family line, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good fake tan that won&#x27;t make me look like an oompa-loompa.  </li>
            <li>- Tanner color is only good when it&#x27;s even, and this my friend, is the catch with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it staining clothes after it has dried.</li>
            <li>This is my second summer using this product and I will recommend it to everyone looking for a good fake tanner.</li>
            <li>I do wish the initial application lasted a bit longer, but it was easy enough to apply and I don&#x27;t mind doing a couple of applications to get a good base tan.</li>
            <li>and it is strong, but at least you won&#x27;t smell like your skin is burning.</li>
            <li>You may want to place a towel down when you spray it because it does get on floors and walls but wipes right up.</li>
            <li>You may want to place a towel down when you spray it because it does get on floors and walls but wipes right up.</li>
            <li>I got the same amazing results and it wasn&#x27;t near as expensive as the professional spray liquid my machine takes!</li>
            <li>The color is very natural, even for a pale-skinned redhead such as myself.  </li>
            <li>I am left with a very natural tan.</li>
            <li>The color left is very natural for me &amp; if you end up with mistakes, you can apply another coat to even it out.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to reach everywhere on your back but the glove does help to reach more than you would with bare hands.</li>
            <li>She was also a blonde hair, blue-eyed, pale girl and had a fabulous tan.</li>
            <li>You really cant reapply with the same coverage as the initial application because as you wash it and as the days do by it wears harder in certain areas than others.</li>
            <li>always need two major exfoliation days to get the leftovers of a spray tan off.</li>
            <li>One major tip....</li>
            <li>And you end up with a lovely bronze tan that looks like you spent a weekend on a beach...not too dark, but definitely a noticeable medium shade tan.  </li>
            <li>I mean I can&#x27;t hold color on a trip to Hawaii for more than two weeks white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that any changes in skin texture such as stretch marks or surgical scars take the pigment differently and also fade at a different rate.</li>
            <li>No other product has EVER worked for me.</li>
            <li>No other enhancements needed.</li>
            <li>This is my first self tanner ive ever used , so im not exactly an expert with the stuff.</li>
            <li>After such unexpected results for him I had to put it on me!</li>
            <li>I had several people comment on my tan that it was natural!</li>
            <li>This works as well, if not better than most of the more expensive sunless tanners that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have had no other problems with this product.  </li>
            <li>I look like a totally different person with a natural glow!</li>
            <li>I think its worth the price and something ill be using all winter long :)</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews (first one was extremely helpful)</li>
            <li>But you HAVE TO take a shower before going out because if anything should splash on you, even if you wash your hands, it leaves major splash marks and streaks.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to not spray too close to the skin as it will make it more difficult to spread and will leave a small dot stain on the skin.</li>
            <li>decided that I would first tan only my legs, in case it became streaky or orange on my white skin with red undertones.</li>
            <li>the color payoff was seldom and the itching was major.</li>
            <li>The color, while not orangey, was very light and wore off oddly in my joints (which is typical of self-tanners</li>
            <li>It seems as though this product was designed for peach toned and super pale people.    </li>
            <li>I am someone who is super pale.</li>
            <li>I am super pale, work night shift and needed something to make me look not so washed out.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for mine and a friends super pale legs.</li>
            <li>I am super pale</li>
            <li>(the bottom of my forearms are super pale</li>
            <li>Also, I am super pale, when I go to the makeup counter</li>
            <li>This self tanner washes off so quickly, I would say in about 2-3 days; and it is quite orange against my extremely pale skin.</li>
            <li>I am super pale (redhead).</li>
            <li>(Mind you I&#x27;m super pale).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is happening but it does leak on me and the spritzer could definetly be upgraded bc although the application process is simple and easy</li>
            <li>Small amount does transfer to clothing, but easily washes out in regular wash cycle&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different sunless tanners and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>After the first time using this, I followed the instruction, exfoliated really well, applied evenly, and not only did it streak, but it left really dark spots in my pores.</li>
            <li>this twice in a day is fine but don&#x27;t use to much, a little goes a long</li>
            <li>Fake Bake makes high quality, affordable tanning products that are just as good as the other high-end tanners on the market.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on other reviews (the Baiden mitten too) and I am happy to say I will never again pay for an expensive spray tan at the salon.  </li>
            <li>St. Tropez Tanning Mousse (this used to be my favorite), Banana Boat, L&#x27;Oreal, the tanning towelettes (Kate Sommerville and a few other brands), etc.  </li>
            <li>Does NOT turn you orange, the tan lasts without extreme maintenance and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do a full body application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put it on super dark, so it&#x27;s lasted a long while for me, nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li>I spent my younger years in the tanning beds and with the proper tanning lotions, i&#x27;d get an adequate color</li>
            <li>Overall it was defiantly worth the money I spent for it!</li>
            <li>This one is not very dark.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not very dark if you use it alone but</li>
            <li>I use jergens  natural glow to spruce up my tan about mid-week (just on my legs as this part always seems to take less color) and my tan lasts normally five to seven days before I actually b do the whole process again.</li>
            <li>it leaves little brown lint balls all stuck to your freshly applied lotion.</li>
            <li>The color that develops before shower is a little brown, but washes off into a golden undertone tan.</li>
            <li>seriously the best fake tanning stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The more often I use it, the less &amp; less I like it.  </li>
            <li>I know the box says you&#x27;ll get darker with more applications, but I only see subtle changes each time.  </li>
            <li>Definitely keep your buff clean though and rinse after each use to prevent it from staining or from getting green.</li>
            <li>he shower, put it on, and sleep in black pants and black shirt on a brown blanket on top of my bed.</li>
            <li>Living in an area that doesn&#x27;t get that much sun, I&#x27;ve found this looks realistic, and I wear it almost all year round except for the summer months when the sun comes out.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t wipe it up quick enough, it might leave a slight stain.</li>
            <li>This is the most realistic looking fake tan I&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
            <li>Spray tanning at a salon was always a hassle with the long wait, the high cost, and it rubbing off on everything.</li>
            <li>It is a very dark tan and looks natural but, still cakes up in spots where you need a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I missed my dark tan from last summer, but as I&#x27;m getting older and wiser (haha)</li>
            <li>Totally reminds me of how the actual sun would tan me so it looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rub it on hard just smooth it on.</li>
            <li>You can wear white right after you have applied this and not worry about it turning your clothes brown like other products.  </li>
            <li>My other tip is- don&#x27;t wear white right afterwards.</li>
            <li>This also depends highly on your skin undertones, if you have yellow, brown or red undertones this product will work well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super dark, it just looks like I spent some time by the pool (very natural looking).</li>
            <li>Less mess and more even tan.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right -- snip the spray tube before trying to use it because it&#x27;s far too long and will make the bottle leak.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the fact that it tends to wash off a little too fast, but then again, there&#x27;s still a lot of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; left after the first wash.</li>
            <li>(and by spray I mean spraying the buffing pad and applying it to the skin) Respraying your arms and legs is fine however.&lt;br /&gt;-Try</li>
            <li>first application resulted in some slight streaking on the thighs, but that was more due to uneven application.  </li>
            <li>my pale skin thanks you!!</li>
            <li>Plus I know how bad the sun is for you, so I decided to try this after reading some of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells great and never smells bad, and I&#x27;ve barely had streaks because I&#x27;ve used the glove and blended in circles</li>
            <li>Anyone who is thinking about buying this, i suggest you do you will be shocked how great the results are.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t generally remember at night</li>
            <li>So the general advice is keep it away from the eyes and don&#x27;t inhale it.</li>
            <li>The tan lasts generally about a week for me</li>
            <li>i generally shave it now before i tan cause it is disproportionate to the rest of my face in regards to the shade i end up with.</li>
            <li>generally anywhere that&#x27;s &amp;#34;bony&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Tan barely shows up and washes off almost completely the next day.</li>
            <li>It always looks really even, not splotchy, even when I&#x27;m being lazy and apply it without much attention.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell how long the color lasts as I am outside every afternoon but even if I have to use it</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tan overnight because self tanners or even lotions make me too hot to sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I will be more careful from now on but this small problem doesn&#x27;t take away from my opinion 😊  </li>
            <li>Until the first time you shower, Fake Bake can transfer onto your light colored clothes or sheets.</li>
            <li>Just so I am clear, I put this on the day before, around 1pm in the afternoon and didn&#x27;t shower until the next morning.</li>
            <li>It went on in a light thin layer not thick and sticky like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The next morning I&#x27;ll rinse and can clearly see the stain coming</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin and have feared the streakiness that self tanners normally leave behind, not to mention the horrid orange tint..</li>
            <li>Your skin actually feels moisterized and soft when you wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>apparently some of the chemicals in it aren&#x27;t that great….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shower daily though since I workout daily, even with using only my hand and a gentle soap the color washes off in one to two showers.</li>
            <li>This must be a really intense product if you need that minimal amount during the application!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Directly sprayed 6 times to my upper arm, 4 to the lower, etc.</li>
            <li>I can barely tan in the sun at all</li>
            <li>Natural tan instantly!</li>
            <li>I am only 17 years old and have already had skin cancer scares.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and have recently quit going to the tanning beds to save my skin.</li>
            <li>You barely smell anything</li>
            <li>I would never go out in public directly after applying it</li>
            <li>I am a 32 year old female.</li>
            <li>Will I keep buying this - yes because I feel like the ease of application and the natural color I get outweighs the short staying power.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up, I shower it off and am left with a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The color is natural and looks like you just got back from a beach trip.  </li>
            <li>Some of them turn me orange, some are streaky, and some have barely any color payoff.</li>
            <li>This morning I was curious to see how much color would come off</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how beautifully naturally tan</li>
            <li>The next day, after the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; set in, I was blown away by how natural and brown it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I frequently travel and I simply refuse to hit the beach/pool without some color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Looks and fades completely natural if taken proper care</li>
            <li>I am a licensed Esthetician and Cosmetologist, and this product sells on Amazon for the same price I can get it at a professional beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>It did get me pretty dark.</li>
            <li>The tan is natural and not yellow.</li>
            <li>It gave me an instant bronze natural color.&lt;br /&gt;Inside</li>
            <li>In the early evening, I took a shower so the guide did wash out, which resulted in a lighter version of the above mentioned, but still,</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first because my one ankle looked really dark...</li>
            <li>Will not transfer to clothing and lasts several days with natural tan look.  </li>
            <li>Still went on streaky even with glove and following directions to not spray directly to skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the dark color when you first spray it on</li>
            <li>currently done w/my tanning for the year and have allowed this to wash off completely</li>
            <li>I get compliments daily as this product looks bronzed and natural.</li>
            <li>I can say this product produces a natural looking tan and darkens well over multiple applications.</li>
            <li>the next morning my 4year old got into my bed to watch a movie  with me</li>
            <li>and I have a yellow hint to my skin naturally that everything turned me orange.</li>
            <li>It gives such a natural tan that does not leave you orange at all.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m a busy mother of 3 children, and don&#x27;t have an immense amount of time to fiddle with application, drying, etc.</li>
            <li>but I used my bare hands to apply.</li>
            <li>Maybe not as apparent as some others that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after a shower, go to sleep on my white sheets and so far haven&#x27;t seen any stains.</li>
            <li>Following so far?  </li>
            <li>and I stay pretty dark.</li>
            <li>The instant color it gives is natural enough to go out in during the day, and the color that stays after you shower is really natural as well.</li>
            <li>But, I have barely made a dent in that six ounces.</li>
            <li>After I took a shower the next morning the color was completely gone like I didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li>It takes about a week to completely wash off if you only used it one day.</li>
            <li>the only time i sprayed on the mitt instead of my skin directly is when I used it on my face, the backs of my hands, and my feet.</li>
            <li>The color is so natural and was almost instant.  </li>
            <li>It can streak your skin if you are not careful though.</li>
            <li>never expected a sunless tanner to be so convenient</li>
            <li>but it barely gave me a tan</li>
            <li>( i am Irish with naturally platinum hair).</li>
            <li>i sprayed onto the mit for my face, neck, chest and back but sprayed directly onto my tummy, arms and legs and then blended.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I am going to wait for it to fade completely before reapplying in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, I think I want a bit darker (especially on my legs which were naturally lighter than my arms</li>
            <li>You MUST be careful with the application, too much will make you orange.</li>
            <li>I suggest putting on your swimsuit and applying OUTSIDE in natural daylight.</li>
            <li>The tan last and skin looks natural.</li>
            <li>It is totally even and looks natural.</li>
            <li>When it started to fade away, it seemed to just grab to my pores and those rough patches -- leaving me straight up orange when I decided to wean off the product.</li>
            <li>But Barely.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty dark.</li>
            <li>The color is instant, gradual and natural looking.</li>
            <li>and yes, all ovet my bare feet  </li>
            <li>When you first put the tanner on it is dark in color and applies evenly.</li>
            <li>I waited until the next morning to take a shower, and it did stain my clothes, but I wore old clothes (the videos said it would</li>
            <li>I like the dark tone they provide, but it can be pretty orange</li>
            <li>I used this so far a total of 6 times.</li>
            <li>I barely touch the mitt to these areas and I still can end up with orange spots if not careful.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, I was horrified to see that I was getting all these dark blotches all over my face.</li>
            <li>I might actually have achieved the colour naturally</li>
            <li>I need to do 2 or 3 days straight of it to get the darkness I want, but then it only last for about 2 days after (with daily showering).</li>
            <li>i could barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li>were practically bare.</li>
            <li>Works very well but be careful when you put in on your hands and feet</li>
            <li>I use this 2 times per week to keep a constant natural glow.</li>
            <li>In getting ready for a friends wedding, I realized how pasty I was, and that I had absolutely no time to tan.</li>
            <li>It did turn me really dark at first, but it was the guide color.</li>
            <li>This is the only self tan product or professional spray tan</li>
            <li>my 2nd purchase so far.</li>
            <li>the nozzle never stopped working.i already bought my second bottle.best product ive tried so far.</li>
            <li>I am pretty dark already, but have psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I bought this on amazon after using Bare Minerals Faux Tan for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheaper than getting spray tanned professionally</li>
            <li>I simply showered and used my normal loofah with a gritty body wash.</li>
            <li>I wish the guide color wasn&#x27;t so dark and obvious, but worth it anyway.  </li>
            <li>Thirdly- even with the replaced bottle and pretty wide</li>
            <li>no real dark on my knees or ankles, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved being tan but knew that bed tanning was dangerous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and the smell always nauseated me.</li>
            <li>It is completely streak free, doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes because it dries fast, and you don&#x27;t smell weird after its settled in.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice tan without looking fake.  </li>
            <li>I know Fake Bake makes their own exfoliant, but I have never tried it.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, not orangey or fake looking.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not great.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think ill even try it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice that I didn&#x27;t have to shower twice in an hour like with 60 min fake bake.</li>
            <li>The formula is better than any $$$ product I have used, but the bottle is so poorly executed I can not recommend.</li>
            <li>However, Fake Bake has a nice coconut smell when it is applied but you will notice after three or four hours that it will start to smell like self tanner.</li>
            <li>And even worse, it still smelled more than 24 hours and 2 showers</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t stepped into a tanning bed in a 2 years &amp; I was missing that golden brown tan.</li>
            <li>I also use the Fake Bake Body Passion Fruit Body Polish beforehand, to give my skin a nice scrub.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better self-tanners I&#x27;ve used, but even so, I still ended up with those dark spots &amp; streaks of uneven tanning.</li>
            <li>A few things that I have noticed that are worth mentioning...</li>
            <li>this is awfully complicated even though the color is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously - if you like a nice fake glow, this is it.</li>
            <li>Has a little bronzer if you need some tan right away.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be leaking right out of the nozzle itself - the little hole the product comes out of.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it does rub off onto white sheets and light colored clothing occasionally (and the towels you lay down before application will look ruined), but WILL wash out.</li>
            <li>this tanner give you awesome color if you don&#x27;t want to be 2 dark and it doesn&#x27;t streak until you get down on the end of the bottle which is weird</li>
            <li>I just looked down when I first got in and the water turned brown.  </li>
            <li>but after a few days I turn right back to my normal white color.</li>
            <li>The only major problem is I have to apply every other day or so or the color fades FAST!</li>
            <li>Easy deep dark long lasting tan with out the Sun!</li>
            <li>For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately.</li>
            <li>For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately.</li>
            <li>Buying my second bottle soon (yes it really lasts that long!)</li>
            <li>The color is very realistic, but I found myself having to apply it every other day to maintain a descent tan.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t find that it smelled or rubbed off on my clothes (as long as I let it dry completely before dressing), and I did really like the color that it gave me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lily white Irish girl who used to live in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pale, but this self tanner has achieved a golden bronze tan that all of my friends compliment.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and very little smell and</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after exfolating as it said let it dry very well before dressing and the next day for</li>
            <li>It also appears that you might be able to layer this product on after the previous layer has dried</li>
            <li>(As others said) It gets Messy, Try to find a spray nozzle that is less spritzy and more guided.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to apply, dried quickly, and left a gorgeous brown color rather than a nasty orange.</li>
            <li>Beware heavy application on your face; that&#x27;s the one place where less is more.</li>
            <li>Like i said it gives you an instant bronze tan, looks very natural, but used a different lighter tan lotion for face.</li>
            <li>It dries immediately, and is very natural looking, lasts several days before reapplying is necessary.</li>
            <li>I wish I new about this product long time ago.</li>
            <li>So to maintain a consistent look you must put this on every single day, and if your not naturally tan at all, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>it dried right away</li>
            <li>but it smelled pretty blah to me, slightly of coconut</li>
            <li>I find that I use less product if I don&#x27;t spray the product on the mit first.</li>
            <li>me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never splotches, never streaks, comes off pretty evenly after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>I previously used Tan Towels but always felt like the result was pretty orangey.</li>
            <li>, i was slightly orange the first day</li>
            <li>Where I used to have to carefully apply lotion, wash my hands a million times, and stand around naked waiting to dry, now I quickly apply this and immediately go get dressed.</li>
            <li>have used other self tanning products in the past, Kheils is still my favorite</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have white towels - which now have lovely orange streaks on them from the tanner that didn&#x27;t come off despite lots of soap and scrubbing!  </li>
            <li>and you can always use a little more and get a little darker.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several bottles of Fake bake and love this product!</li>
            <li>I have used other products in the past and love this one.  </li>
            <li>This self-tanner produces more of a bronze color vs the orange color I usually develop with other products.</li>
            <li>I say this because my first time I didn&#x27;t do this as a total airhead and went up one leg, and then found myself leaning against the leg I had just done to do the other.</li>
            <li>it was much less scented and dried super fast - like, 3 minutes</li>
            <li>If not completely dry it will rub off on clothes or streak in the rain!</li>
            <li>It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li>It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li>It very faintly resembles the scent of other self tanners however, the color is a rich golden, leaps &amp; bounds better looking than other tanners!</li>
            <li>at first it smelled very nice like cocoanut but after 20 minutes it started to smell very bad</li>
            <li>This product if used properly does not even look like a fake tan it goes on smoothly and blends very very well to where I had people asking me where I went tanning at.</li>
            <li>The only negative I can say is that most of the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; washes off during your next shower so I have to reapply several times a week.</li>
            <li>My family has a super high number of people with skin cancer throughout, and I am less and less charmed with the idea of being in a tanning bed three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my second favorite it the neutrogena micromist in &#x27;dark&#x27;, but it just isnt quite dark enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I put the mit on and noticed right away that it was not the same quality--the foam felt less dense than the Ulta mit.</li>
            <li>It was not near as strong as most of the fake tanners, but I could still smell it, I used a little perfume to mask the smell.</li>
            <li>If your skin is really dry, or even remotely dry use lotion first.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and on the dry areas it was super dark, and the oilier areas no color.</li>
            <li>I skip the applicator mit (if you use it, be sure to wear a glove inside of it or you&#x27;ll be sorry) and use an extra large flat kabuki brush to buff on the color.</li>
            <li>Application was certainly much easier than any other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t orangey, but it does come out patchy in a lot of places due to the contours of your body and the fast drying time.</li>
            <li>I really doubted it would work, I&#x27;d forgotten about it, found it the other day and OMGOSH.</li>
            <li>With as much as you&#x27;ll spend on other tanners, give it a try.</li>
            <li>would buy again its just as the picture and description and cheaper than buying at Sephora or other beauty stores thanks A+++</li>
            <li>A co-worker mentioned this product and I really was sold on the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in place by putting a rubber band around my wrist, but that really doesn&#x27;t work all that well, and it&#x27;s an inconvenience when it&#x27;s time to switch everything over to using the other hand.</li>
            <li>I find my face and chest seems to fade much faster then other parts</li>
            <li>I really love this product already, I have been using it for a little over a week now, almost everyday</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Fades a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;d say you couldn&#x27;t go for more than a few days/a week without re-applying&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is definitely not dark or long-lasting enough to use alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT...it&#x27;s not dark enough and my husband says that he can&#x27;t even tell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not dark enough.</li>
            <li>I know a long review is annoying, but I can not stress enough how AWESOME this product is!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is probably because of how hard I&#x27;m pressing this over my skin and you really have to apply pressure because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up streaky because this product dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Not smelly, get you dark very fast and dry very fast too compare to other sunless tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I rinse it thoroughly and allow it to air dry before putting it away, and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>I cannot find for a decent price, so after a few attempts this year with new products I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I have used California Tan Bronzing spray ONLY for the last year, so I was nervous about trying a new and different product.</li>
            <li>I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later.</li>
            <li>I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d quit because I really didn&#x27;t think it was good for my skin and had been pale for about 6 months, plus it really was time consuming and a little expensive.</li>
            <li>but I tend to like a more dramatic bronze.</li>
            <li>Super natural and subtle, and no streaks whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This product goes on easy, and increases with daily use ( but not to a ridiculous color).  </li>
            <li>However, my only complaint is that it tends to slide off your hand easily if you don&#x27;t keep your fingers spread inside the mitt to hold it in place, but no big deal there.</li>
            <li>this is the lazy tanner&#x27;s DREAM), and easy to smell (because all self-tanners know the usual tanner &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; is really leaving something to be desired).  </li>
            <li>and it really does dry quickly enough so that you can get dressed in about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it will seem unnaturally dark but that&#x27;s the initial color.</li>
            <li>My favorite fake tan product so far.</li>
            <li>If I can think far enough ahead, I like to apply it the day prior to the day where I&#x27;ll be exposing my legs -</li>
            <li>Fake bake is the most natural tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The squirt top does leak and gets messy, even after I cut a half inch off the tubing, havent found a fix for that, and thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>It leaves a great and natural olive color, and is idiot proof in application.  </li>
            <li>It will come off on your clothes if not completely dry &amp;</li>
            <li>I tried the Fake Bake Lotion last year, and really liked the results.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and then I applied a 2nd coat the next morning.  </li>
            <li>You must be careful not to get smears, but it is a realistic color of reddish &amp;#34;tan,&amp;#34; not orange.</li>
            <li>I even watched several demonstrations on YouTube, so I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li>Well worth every little penny that this bottle costs!</li>
            <li>It will turn your face very dark very fast.  </li>
            <li>Very easy application, can&#x27;t go wrong with the spray and mitt.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li>But throughout the day it started to smell a little (it was hot too)</li>
            <li>an I put a little on first to see how it would tur out</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I was a little splotchy but</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it for the first time when you have somewhere you need to be as it takes a little while to figure out the technique and work out the kinks.</li>
            <li>With other tanners my face, hands, and feet are usually blotchy and streaked but that does not happen with fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li>I put a little more on the next day for a little darker tan.</li>
            <li>so I was a little nervous about the first application..</li>
            <li>she exfoliates and has tried several times to see barely any difference!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a natural looking fake tan, who doesn&#x27;t wanna risk their safety with a tanning bed, who wants a long lasting tan, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t wanna fork out the cash for a salon spray tan that doesn&#x27;t have the quality that thisproduct does.</li>
            <li>and hours after, it dried very fast and did not streak me or come off on my clothes or in the shower</li>
            <li>It smells good at first, but you have to leave it on for several hours, and as time goes on, it smells worse and worse.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and red hair, so I don&#x27;t tan very well in the sun and the tanning bed gets expensive and is not healthy.  </li>
            <li>Fast, I mean like in 15 seconds fast.</li>
            <li>I mean, for standard shipping (FREE) I couldn&#x27;t believe how well packaged and</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m seriously orange!&amp;#34; It also didn&#x27;t last very well and came off very splotchy!</li>
            <li>and I pay special attention to negative reviews.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to wait and see if you did it right a few hours later.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical with how you apply it, but oddly enough it works great.</li>
            <li>but the first application didn&#x27;t leave me very dark.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite for a few reasons, partially due to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very dark anymore, and I can barely see tan lines.. especially on my legs and back, and face.</li>
            <li>Also toned down the areas that absorbed dry patch areas by using the moisturizer, it made things even.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a little messy, make sure and do it somewhere that you can clean up later</li>
            <li>I burn and turn right back to pale never tan.</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed because it did produce a great color</li>
            <li>It worked very well, but it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my legs (probably because of the time</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the color is that dark, to get the color I really want I have to do two applications.</li>
            <li>It goes on dark, so you can really see what and where your applying it.</li>
            <li>It can really help you achieve a dark color by using some days in a row to build up.</li>
            <li>This does dry quickly, has a decent and subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t streak.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t really provide a dark tan, there is no streaking of the skin....  </li>
            <li>I am very pail and have tried two other brands of self tanners that left me looking streaky and orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Other self tanners that had much longer lasting color and that have also given me my desirable color after one use, but those tend to be the orangey ones.</li>
            <li>I applied this immediately after I exfoliated/shaved/showered/dried off and the next morning I barely saw any brown in the water during my shower.</li>
            <li>and i only had a hint like a barely there hint of color</li>
            <li>The color guard is fool proof and completely wearable if you are wanting to wear it during the day (as long as you won&#x27;t be sweating).</li>
            <li>I left this on for 16 hours and you can barely tell I used anything.  </li>
            <li>few notes for those trying this for the first time from my trial and error:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The first few applications seemed to work well since it provided a bit of color to my legs.</li>
            <li>At first it will smell like coconut but be prepared for the harsh self tanner smell to follow.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pretty pail like me you might have to use it a few days in a row.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first, but after several uses, I love the product.  </li>
            <li>evens it out pretty well after a few hours.</li>
            <li>so I looked funny for a few days with a ring around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am obsessed with Fake Bake because it is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>Few things first before using I had to cut the straw in the bottle</li>
            <li>The mitt disintegrates more with each use and is not ideal for face applications, as it does not distribute evenly onto face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed and really wanted to love this!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and looks just tan enough, not super dark and definitely not orange.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I was super shocked at how easy this stuff was to put on.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s tinted, it was easy to apply evenly, and it dried quickly - no staining clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li>The formula dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to waste time waiting for it dry.</li>
            <li>I usually stay away from tanning applicators or crazy &amp;#34;mitts&amp;#34; but I gave this a try because of the reviews and what a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>but I got splashed by people jumping in the pool and it made very noticable lines down my legs.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than other products!</li>
            <li>So much that I&#x27;ve purchased for other items of this brand!</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for pale whiteys like me.</li>
            <li>Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.  </li>
            <li>I live in New England (which, if you&#x27;re not familiar with Snowpocalipse 2015, has technically turned into Alaska).</li>
            <li>But this is seriously foolproof and will give even the fairest skin tones a chance to feel like a golden goddess!  </li>
            <li>So much better than the other products I used in the past!</li>
            <li>First of all I think a review only works if you know a little background history of the person that used it.</li>
            <li>NATURAL looking (keep in mind this is on practically glow in the dark white girl skin...!) and doesn&#x27;t fade unevenly like most other spray/lotions.</li>
            <li>At first especially on your face after application you will be a little worried that it will streak or not look even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m scrubbing hard either, just a quick sponge off.</li>
            <li>But I am pretty pale</li>
            <li>I am pretty pale in the winter months, so I needed something to make my skin look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and had no issues with this.</li>
            <li>I am pretty pale</li>
            <li>Funny too, cause the rest of your body will still be pale.</li>
            <li>and I have a pretty pale complexion.</li>
            <li>In the past, I have bought a similar product near the same price, but am much happier with this one!</li>
            <li>That I love it, not sure about winter, it will look quite dark over such non tanned skin and will be way too obvious</li>
            <li>I usually have this funky odor from the other self tanners, but this one is not as strong though,</li>
            <li>It looks natural and lasts a long time on the body and in the bottle!</li>
            <li>The parts that rec&#x27;d the initial fresh, wet mitt turned out noticeably darker than other areas.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was surprised at how natural this tan looks, and i&#x27;m a pale blonde.</li>
            <li>I have used tanning beds for years to get a little color on my very very pale skin, but I have always been worried in the back of my head about what kind of long term damage I was doing.  </li>
            <li>It dries immediately and you could hop right into bed or go about your day - a small amount will rub off on your clothes but it won&#x27;t cause the tan to be streaky.</li>
            <li>and I will usually apply this after I have taken a shower and right before bed</li>
            <li>would highly recommend looking up videos on youtube on how to apply this if you&#x27;re unsure because that&#x27;s what I did and never had any problems with it appearing streaky, orange or any of the other issues people tend to run into with self</li>
            <li>Self-tanners usually dry my skin but also help clear my face, this one gave me some clogged pores/breakouts - I don&#x27;t recommend on the face.  </li>
            <li>I heard great things about this self tanner but was left disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application takes less than 5 minutes and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>Also let it dry completely before doing anything.</li>
            <li>Dry off completely.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions written in one review and this product worked perferctly; exfoliate, dry off completely, add moisturizer to knees, elbows, and ankles, apply at night and shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive and dry skin, and atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast, so you can get dressed in minutes instead of standing around like a starfish for half an hour.</li>
            <li>That along with the blending balm on my knuckles and side of my palms is really affective for getting the color to my hands without leaving odd markings or shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That along with the blending balm on my knuckles and side of my palms is really affective for getting the color to my hands without leaving odd markings or shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To use it I have to shave the day before I plan to use it (if I shave the same night my legs don&#x27;t get as dark) and then the night of I exfoliate my whole body, put on in-the-shower lotion and spray my knees and elbows with body oil.</li>
            <li>the glove kind of sucks which was disappointing because the reviews i watched said it was the best part of this particular kit but just during the first application the glove got all nasty and like, matted?</li>
            <li>This gave me a natural looking, long lasting tan.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the professional spray....</li>
            <li>:  Be careful if you wear the product out without rinsing it off first because if it gets wet, it will run.  </li>
            <li>One bottle was enough for at least six full body applications.</li>
            <li>I have medium colored skin, light brown hair, and dark green eyes.</li>
            <li>I tan easily, but I&#x27;m tired of ruining my skin with the sun and tanning beds.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I kept going over and over the same areas on my legs and wasted a lot of the product, and ended up turning bronze orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it a few times following directions exactly and each time my skin looked splotchy</li>
            <li>I found this one late one night and the girl was super tan.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about trying any tanning products but after reading and hearing rave reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate first, use lotion on drier areas such as knees and elbows, spray the mitt a few times, and spread as evenly as you can.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses of the mitt, it was gross and smelled funny.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell is fantastic, and even in the morning before I wash it off, the self-tanner smell IS there, but it&#x27;s much more subtle than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, including the Fake Bake foam and lotion formulas.</li>
            <li>I wake up bronzed and after I shower, the base color is gone and I am left with a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly strong and I get tired of the smell.  </li>
            <li>The product said it could be used on your face, although they sell a face lotion version, and while it did work it took a bit of practice to get right of amount (a little goes a long way on the face) of tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Normally with other products I have a hard time wearing spaghetti straps or bras that fit a little tighter than normal because the pressure will take the tan off</li>
            <li>this gives you the option of a deep dark tan if u want or a little light color which is what I needed.  </li>
            <li>you want to get real dark you need to apply a few days in a row, but for someone like me who is real pale one or two applications puts me in a happy place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful around your knees, ankles and elbows, this stuff gives a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to apply before bed, but I would advise against that if you sweat at night, I ended up sweating in my sleep and had my arm folded and had a very noticeable brown line down my arm the next day.  </li>
            <li>Other than the shade, the main reason this tanner works so well is the mitt - definitely use the mitt!</li>
            <li>I also feel like my color is a little streaky in certain areas,</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, if you&#x27;re pale like me, may not be enough.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying, I&#x27;m pretty pale, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with little mess.</li>
            <li>, basically, I&#x27;ve had great luck with Fake Bake products in the past, and I don&#x27;t think think one is any different.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my second bottle a few weeks back for when I ran out of my first.</li>
            <li>when I take a shower the next day I put another coat on and that&#x27;s it for about four days when it starts to fade, I usually do another coat for a few more day</li>
            <li>When I showered and dried off it was gone and left a pretty tan (obviously it was just the color indicator that streaked).</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t quite last the full week.</li>
            <li>What I am most afraid of when trying new self tanners is that the color will come off orangey and streaky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast too, took less than 15min to apply all over, and I seen the results instantly.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is easy to apply, lasts a number of days and looks natural enuf for people to comment on my tan.</li>
            <li>This will soften the dry areas and dilute the tanner enough that it will develop a natural</li>
            <li>I tried St. Tropez mousse previous to this and didn&#x27;t care much for the results (it only worked on my arms).</li>
            <li>I used to tan in a tanning bed daily, even though skin cancer runs through my family and it is terribly unhealthy; however, I refused to get a spray tan out of fear that it would turn me orange, look blochy, rub off easily in skin creases &amp; folds, etc.</li>
            <li>Wear offs easily about after 3 days it also stains light colored clothes which can be annoying</li>
            <li>Then I dry off with a towel, and apply Fake Bake with the handy dandy included mitten.</li>
            <li>I typically go to the tanning bed but it has been a bit pricey lately and the self tanners are also a better alternative for your skin.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it goes away so quick (at least for me)</li>
            <li>This stuff is sooo easy to use and gives me an instant dark tan with the bronzer, and develops to a very natural colored dark tan over a few hours, so that by the time you shower and rinse off the bronzer, you are tan underneath.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake has a VERY light coconut smell</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this color is VERY light, and washes off immediately in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Despite my Italian heritage, I get pretty pale during the winter months, so every spring I start experimenting with various types of sunless</li>
            <li>The color developed into a very natural bronze shade and dried faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The tan does not last as long as it did with the regular Fake Bake lotion I used before, and when it wears away, it gets kind of blotchy looking.  </li>
            <li>The most annoying thing about this product is that it literally sweats off (I had brown sweat running down my legs), and the color doesn&#x27;t last much more than a day.  </li>
            <li>Definitely exfoliate prior to use and give yourself about 30 mins to dry completely.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Flawless is hard to mess up if you take your time &amp; follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to absolutely exfoliate before applying fake bake or it will get patchy like typical tanners.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts, but I really like it, and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I mean, I exfoliated in the shower the first time, dried off completely, and really worked the spray in well.</li>
            <li>definitely wouldn&#x60;t use it first time before some important event - to be shocked or be surprised on the results ( good or bad way).&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>When I shower for the few days after I use the product I don&#x27;t use a rag and scrub because then it will come off in certain areas.</li>
            <li>My skin started to get very dry and sensitive after I stopped tanning</li>
            <li>I was a little worried after another reviewer said it didn&#x27;t work on her pale skin, but it was fine for me.  </li>
            <li>and the mitt is really beginning to pill and leave little chunks of the material on my skin.</li>
            <li>Mitt could use a little improvement as it doesn&#x27;t stay on your hand very well</li>
            <li>i really think i was glowing in the dark!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give you a realistic, dark tan that gets you constant compliments.</li>
            <li>I am already quite tan and turn very very tan in the summer, so i got this for the winter times when im not as tan as usual.</li>
            <li>Usually I am either super pale or pretty pink with no in between.</li>
            <li>The only problems I really had was it came off the tops of my feet a little bit and</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s useful for reaching the areas that are hard to reach by hand alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s useful for reaching the areas that are hard to reach by hand alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought Id try this one, it was a little more expensive (not by much)</li>
            <li>on the mitt provided in the box (whichever hand you prefer) then spray the mist directly onto your SKIN, then rub it in gently with the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to rub it too hard because it may irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it has a very dark color gaurd which I appreciated when applying.  </li>
            <li>It also smells a lot better and is less messy than other tanning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Good color, no streaks, the smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for building up a tan over a few days; You&#x27;re not going to apply it once and look like a crazy orange person.</li>
            <li>HUGE problem I have with this is that it is left behind EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>As a very fair-skinned 28-year old female, I&#x27;ve tried self-tanning to avoid the negative effects that sun exposure brings.  </li>
            <li>It was a reasonable price and the results are natural and leaves you looking like you&#x27;ve spent a few days at the beach.</li>

            <li> The product itself is great, however, the bottle is defective.</li>
            <li> The color is great but it does wear on the sheets.</li>
            <li> things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let these things deter you from buying because this product is great</li>
            <li> So I just rely in my makeup to match my body, and that works great.</li>
            <li> The color is great.</li>
            <li> I used the Xen Tan balm on my elbows/knees/feet/hands as someone recommended in a review and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Also it does give a great color.</li>

            <li> It looks great.  </li>
            <li> If I do, that&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me orange and they provide a mitt which is great and helps prevent a streaking effect that can happen without a mitt or sponge.  </li>
            <li> Still a great product</li>
            <li> The color guard is GREAT.</li>
            <li> Also a lot of people said that you need to shower the morning after applying because of the color guard, well i dont shower after and it works great and doesnt rub off</li>

            <li> as though I&#x27;ve had a great time out in the sun over the weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not paid by this company to write a great review.  </li>
            <li> This worked great.  </li>
            <li> It has great coverage and you have a lot of control over where it goes.  </li>
            <li> Besides the nice looking tan you get, one of the best perks is saving a hundred bucks a month from the tanning salons and risking melanoma..</li>
            <li> Almost like chocolate (khalua or mudslide😋) color guard is great</li>
            <li> Great self tanner.</li>

            <li> Looks great, no streaks.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to sitting in a tanning bed and risking cancer.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this tanner was the lack of DHA smell, instead, it has a nice coconut smell when applying and after washing off the color gaurd</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great...</li>
            <li> Some reason it was great until I got to my chest.</li>

            <li> Pleasant smell,  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The pleasant coconut smell had been replaced by that signature I&#x27;ve been using self tanner smell, but not the strongest I&#x27;ve smelled compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The scent from this product, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t overpowering either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It had a pleasant smell and wasn&#x27;t over powering.</li>

            <li> -It has a pleasant smell.    </li>

            <li> it leaves a very nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use!!  </li>
            <li> The best part is that the product delivers a true &#x27;tan&#x27; color with no orange!</li>

            <li> Although tanwise lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t wash off in the shower as easy, FakeBake is literally the best tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and the easy way to apply is just the best.  </li>
            <li> The girl made it look sooooo easy and the color she turned was a gorgeous tan!!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and dries fast.the best part is that you wash it off after 60 minutes, which means your bedding doesn&#x27;t turn brown!  </li>

            <li> I love all their products but flawless is my favorite!</li>
            <li> The color guard was awesome, however it settled in every fine line I have.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a quick Homecoming tan!</li>
            <li> It also smells VERY good, compared to most self tanners.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use !</li>
            <li> Also, it is very easy to wash!</li>

            <li> You will look amazing with a great tan.</li>
            <li> I should have known better then try another kind when the one I already use works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t in good conscience knowing they are misleading consumers.</li>
            <li> I have fair, fair skin and need something to take the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; away.  </li>
            <li> I loved it 👌</li>
            <li> and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle.</li>
            <li> Then the tan is good for about five days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who has stayed away from tanning because of my fair skin.</li>
            <li> this has a great smell, looks nice, but you have to put it on every day.</li>
            <li> Color is good but washes off.</li>
            <li> So it may be good for people wanting a boost to there already tan skin.</li>
            <li> I would say this is good to wear if you are in a pinch and need some color for a weekend event, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem finding a good self tanner because all the lotions tend to clog my pores and break me out.</li>
            <li> The color is good for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, also.  </li>
            <li> This worked good in the beginning now</li>
            <li> If you want this to look good you should expect to take your time applying it.</li>
            <li> and I already have good color.</li>
            <li> Color builds gradually, which in my opinion is good, because if you do goof up, it won&#x27;t stand out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo good though...</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> It does look good on my medium skin tone, though.</li>
            <li> Always good.</li>
            <li> But once i got it and tried it, i loved it.</li>
            <li> Good color and coverage.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff, I bought this because I will be in a wedding on December 15th.</li>
            <li> So I bought this on recommendation from my girlfriend, and it works really really good.</li>
            <li> The product itself is just fair.</li>
            <li> but I do agree that this one has a good color.</li>
            <li> I put it on after showering in the morning, and through out the day had gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Yes, using this product gives you an all-over immediate tan, but if you wear it to bed as people state, then it doesn&#x27;t even help you look good (while you sleep?</li>
            <li> Gives you good color in a hurry</li>
            <li> When I wake up the color is good, then I take a shower and all the color washes off.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> it seems to remove from hands good.</li>
            <li> looks gorgeous from the minute you apply it, no waiting to see how it came out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be good for another two days</li>
            <li> It works great, nice even tan...</li>
            <li> Good building tan.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I also have to use a good face wash or my face will break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product, but I haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s the answer for me yet.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great for fair complexions</li>
            <li> Every time I put it on around my boyfriend, he tells me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if your on a budget and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to reiterate all of the good comments and tanning tips.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good on the legs.</li>
            <li> It looks good when you apply it, but when you shower, the majority of it washes off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly fair</li>
            <li> and I was worried that I would never find a self tanner that could make me look as good as the beds do.....</li>
            <li> Works SOOO good, you have to have time to do this.</li>
            <li> Now remind you, I&#x27;m fair skinned...not</li>
            <li> The color of this tanner is fantastic, and the mitt that comes with it gives flawless application.</li>
            <li> being that I am quite fair skinned,</li>
            <li> Definately good</li>
            <li> but Tanwise from Sally is just as good and cheaper</li>
            <li> Great way to get nice even color.  </li>
            <li> The tan is as good as the custom spray tans I have gotten at the salon for $50 per session.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> It spreads evenly and nicely without streaking and the color it gives is great.</li>
            <li> Good color</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Good question, that instruction was not include on how to use the mitt.</li>
            <li> but i saw immediate color and loved the smell</li>
            <li> It looks so good.</li>
            <li> really good price also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m a teenager with fair skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no St. Tropez but fairly close.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate and shave before applying and the color looks good</li>
            <li> and I also tried SunLabs because I also heard some good things</li>
            <li> The good news though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain...</li>
            <li> this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I am extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Smells great, tropical kind of like coconut.</li>
            <li> You will get a fair amount of color washing off, but you will still be tan.</li>
            <li> Then it will come out good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair</li>
            <li> I loved it..</li>
            <li> Works well gives good color</li>
            <li> smellls good and gives you a temporary tan, but I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> this one has good reviews</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> It does not smell particularly good and you can see it washing off in the shower</li>
            <li> I can put it on and go out because it SMELLS GOOD.</li>
            <li> the color is good................</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned.</li>
            <li> any good pessimist, however, I&#x27;ve found a couple of flaws, and offer them here as a buyer beware.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good</li>
            <li> One good quality this product had was the smell.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night, then shower in the morning &amp; am good to go.  </li>
            <li> Being a redhead Ive been searching for years to find a good self tanner, one that doesn&#x27;t leave me orange or glittery.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of self tanner and saw that this one got a lot of good feedback</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I know others have posted some good reviews.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> YouTube has good vids on how to put it on.  </li>
            <li> so I would look good at the pool...</li>
            <li> what island I escaped to, but I just laughed and then told them about this</li>
            <li> (I can never get them to tan, even after weeks in a bed with good lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and</li>
            <li> Two coats was good for me.</li>
            <li> , it does a good job of spreading everything evenly.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of experience with self tanners, but I still know what looks good and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> The mitt is good because you can blend</li>
            <li> Because i have fair skin</li>
            <li> I also loved that it came with the applying glove.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered ontime and in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color came out fairly evenly.</li>
            <li> Good medium darkness after one application.</li>
            <li> i loved it,</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have not noticed any orange tones.  </li>
            <li> so i am as fair skinned as it gets,  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> I would use it in the morning and walk out of the house and people loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I have fair freckle skin, it tans but does not look orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous and brown.</li>
            <li> They never did their job as good as this product.</li>
            <li> im fair skinned</li>
            <li> This stuff is just superior.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you want some color before going out</li>
            <li> am thrilled at the purchase and happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> and you can never truly blend it even when expoliating, its good for day</li>
            <li> and it smells good during application.&lt;br /&gt;Besides</li>
            <li> It was a good item for the price, except for my hands, I like that the tanning mitt does a good job of minimum streaks on the body.</li>
            <li> I just got this item with good</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product, but just did not work for me...</li>
            <li> I tried this item today and loved it.  </li>
            <li> , product dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Good value for quality of the product-</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want good</li>
            <li> Good product to have without a risk of getting a skin cancer and cost cheaper than go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Would be good for a one time event I guess...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> As good as home-self-applied fake-tanner can be...</li>
            <li> It does work good</li>
            <li> Still cannot perfect the streak free look</li>
            <li> Good smell though...</li>
            <li> good smell.</li>
            <li> and I dont think it is nearly as good as this one is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay over $100 for a product this good.</li>
            <li> Though I assume it would look good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a tropical smell as its so good</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like that which is good.</li>
            <li> Good luck, men.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo good though...</li>
            <li> I have used it three times-two days apart each time-and it looks good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say this too lightly when I say this is the best self-tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin w/ freckles</li>
            <li> but he thinks this looks really good and encourages me to use it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> If you want the perfect tan, get the product, read the instructions in Glynis Ewing&#x27;s review here on Amazon and you will get fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Good for mistakes.</li>
            <li> Good for mistakes.</li>
            <li> I have even applied this before and while at the beach with good results.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It gives a really good color though.</li>
            <li> I am so fair skinned and have skin cancer also</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with the good characteristics.</li>
            <li> Even with a good applicator, it will make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it it takes alot of reapplications to get a good brown color...</li>
            <li> Good tanner.  </li>
            <li> I squirt it on my hands, apply it to my face and it looks really good.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a good week or until I do another exfoliate and shave again.</li>
            <li> but you have to rub it in really good</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was the highest rated by users on Amazon, and had some good, in-depth reviews.</li>
            <li> Over all, product works good.</li>
            <li> Good (Almond,</li>
            <li> Good Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 52 with fair skin.</li>
            <li> Already I was looking good.</li>
            <li> And just in case you are wondering, I was NOT paid to give a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I lather up my body really good twice with my soap..</li>
            <li> Once you get good at applying it, no one can tell it is not a sun tan.  </li>
            <li> and it works good.</li>
            <li> All good things but</li>
            <li> It also has a fairly good staying power.</li>
            <li> girls and I like this because the color is good, not so orangey and fake.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> I apply at night after bathing and exfoliating my skin really good and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> Also the color looks really good.</li>
            <li> It also is a good color, not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This gives a progressively gradual color and makes me feel good about myself.  </li>
            <li> I washed the mitten after use, and it stays good.  </li>
            <li> Smell was good too...</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead who dreams of being tan.</li>
            <li> , I am fair with freckles and when i got done using it</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s a good product too.</li>
            <li> I really loved this self tanner.</li>
            <li> and that I can get a good tan without risking cancer in tanning beds.</li>
            <li> but the over all product is  good</li>
            <li> I bought this produced because it had good reviews</li>
            <li> The applicator is good for maybe one or two applications.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and freckles and do not like to tan but was going to Disney World</li>
            <li> i ordered this product for my redhaired fair skinned daughter.</li>
            <li> I had read that people with fair skin had good luck, but not for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im naturally fair skinned, but tan well.</li>
            <li> It gives good color</li>
            <li> so this is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> a good self tan says something doesnt it?</li>
            <li> fair, freckled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either use a good sugar scrub or get an exfoliating mitt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does give you a great nice even tan.</li>
            <li> It got good reviews, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly fair that when I roll up my pants in the sunlight, I pull a &#x27;Twilight&#x27;.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a good thing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin, and knew the risk I was putting myself in.</li>

            <li> It works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it once, and I had fairly good results.</li>
            <li> Every one on youtube was raving about this product saying how good it was</li>
            <li> but I could tell there was a good amount of color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl who can tan; but chooses not to.</li>
            <li> but this product seems to be good.</li>
            <li> Gives me a good fan.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair skinned</li>
            <li> if you put it on at night before bed, it&#x27;s a good idea to have dark-colored bedsheets, or else you&#x27;re going to have some staining on your sheets by morning.</li>
            <li> I started using the St. Tropez mousse and loved it, but decided to give this stuff a try after my bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m good with the shade it gives me.</li>
            <li> it looks great on my skin-tone and the smell is nice too.</li>

            <li> I have used Jergens to Sublime to whatever else I picked up at CVS to get a gorgeous glow.</li>

            <li> On the day I was to receive product, I exfoliated, moisturized and was so excited to put it on after all the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li> Guess I should just stick with a good thing when I have it! :)</li>
            <li> I have found that it works best to apply on clean skin at night and then take a shower in the morning.  </li>

            <li> I know, no matter your skin tone it blends beautifully :)</li>

            <li> This is absolutely the best body tanner I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Will give you color after the 4-6hr wait, rinse off color guide and you will have a nice tan that is not orange.</li>
            <li> The applicator mitt tends to soak up a lot of product, so I&#x27;d just use the plastic gloves on their own.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice tan look, not orange at all.  </li>

            <li> the color was nice and lasted about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Rubbed it in nicely with the mitt.</li>
            <li> I use a loofah to exfoliate, put some lotion on my elbows and knees, and use the handy mitten to apply.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say it smells nice</li>
            <li> It really truly smells the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used (my boyfriend approves).</li>
            <li> and I just smiled and said, \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> I reapplied this for three nights in a row and now I&#x27;m a nice tan shade.</li>
            <li> This product really can be applied flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a great transaction and great quality product.</li>
            <li> The result is a nice even bronze color.</li>
            <li> It gives a great looking tan in no time and the low price is excellent.</li>
            <li> But, there is still a nice tan on your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I highly recommend it as a must try!</li>
            <li> the color is awesome and the idea of using a mitt and protective rubber gloves really makes self tanning</li>
            <li> liked that unlike the lotions or mousse</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to try this product from all the rave reviews and the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> I also really liked that it didn&#x27;t stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> flawless dries really fast</li>
            <li> application; it&#x27;s spreads nicely, gives an immediate color that continues to develop through the day/night without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING AND WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Loving this product, can&#x27;t wait to show my mother.</li>
            <li> The built in bronzer leaves a really nice color while the tanner is developing.</li>
            <li> and it even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Even after I showered I had a nice tan through the week.</li>
            <li> I recommend showering before you wear something nice.</li>
            <li> I washed it after every tan application with warm water and</li>
            <li> I fear lots of compliments on &amp;#34; my nice tan&amp;#34; , &amp;#34; where have you been&amp;#34; .</li>

            <li> /&gt;i am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply in good lighting</li>
            <li> a nice brown</li>
            <li> The mitt is nice, and I recommend shaving and exfoliating before doing this and leavin it on for 12 hours + then rinse off your body, and you will have a nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> so i make sure to wash it really good after i use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone that wants a nice, even looking tan without using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a good moisturizer before tanning those areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really what gives you the flawless result.</li>
            <li> it really does make you look flawless.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s probably the darkest tan I have ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li> and I always get a nice, even color.</li>
            <li> (Which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I kind of like it...</li>
            <li> It was sketchy getting it off Amazon, but it really is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> I liked the St. Tropez lotion but found after one application I would take a shower and</li>
            <li> product does have a nice smell in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a handy applicator pad.  </li>

            <li> : I wanted to try self tanners so I could have a nice tan for a wedding I am in, instead of using tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed at home</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tan in a bottle on the market ...</li>
            <li> I will use up the product, because it does give a nice color</li>
            <li> Gives a nice brown tan.</li>

            <li> or so you will get a nice bronze look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This goes on really nicely, and you can see where you are applying the color.</li>
            <li> but this one looked like a nice option because of the price, 2k glowing reviews, and the fact that it came with a mit.</li>
            <li> that awesome bronze goddess glow that every woman wants but to no avail.</li>
            <li> it kind of smells like chocolate) and</li>
            <li> Nice</li>

            <li> smells nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive complexion and this gives me a nice glow on legs.</li>
            <li> and the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> After that I wake up NON SMELLY with a nice tan</li>
            <li> and honestly I don&#x27;t want to do that once a week.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice color though.</li>
            <li> Loving this product.</li>

            <li> Dries fast, not orange, no streaking and smells great!!</li>

            <li> Smells nice too.  </li>

            <li> The box has everything you will need for application, so thats nice that you wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase a mitt or gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this na dthen let me try her once before i ordered my own.  </li>
            <li> Liked the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice golden/brown tan.</li>

            <li> i dont agree with the nice smell.</li>
            <li> think this product fades nicely and doesn&#x27;t get blotchy when it&#x27;s fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly the ritual for putting this stuff on is a pain I find.</li>
            <li> : If you are allergic to latex gloves, buy the senstive kind.</li>
            <li> This fake-bake creates a nice light-med brown color with no orange undertones.  </li>
            <li> i tried everything else and found some lotions that i liked for the color however when it would fade</li>
            <li> Honestly I would save your money.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be really popular</li>
            <li> Will be a nice collection to have when I start accutane and can&#x27;t use tanning beds.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I was already fairly tan, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was going to show up on me.</li>
            <li> The mitt it comes with to apply the product really helps to make your tan flawless and not streaky.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I&#x27;m surprised at all the wonderful reviews given by fair-skinned people saying it&#x27;s bronze and not orange-y.</li>
            <li> It is so nice not walking around looking orangey,</li>
            <li> Just a nice glowy look.</li>

            <li> and it was a nice looking tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that they include latex gloves.</li>
            <li> But i just can&#x27;t seem to get it to go on my legs or belly as nice.</li>
            <li> and I can apply it anytime in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping at a great price!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and gave it a chance because the color is very nice, but it just didn&#x27;t sit well on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product which gives you a very nice and smooth tan.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Gave me a very nice light brown skin color</li>
            <li> I love love love love love love it! :D</li>
            <li> This is an easy application,  it sets flawlessly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> product(s) as it provides me the best color and super easy application.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is VERY easy to apply - the applicator mitt is wonderful and ensures an even application.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very tropical and coconutty - like sun tan oil, and does not have that foul \\&quot;self tanner smell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had a beautiful bronze glow the very first time.</li>
            <li> Though it is messier than the original because it&#x27;s a spray, it gives a great color.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and it smells very nice!</li>
            <li> and it has been great for truly rinsing out all of the tanner and letting the mitt return to original status.</li>
            <li> and it has been great for truly rinsing out all of the tanner and letting the mitt return to original status.</li>
            <li> I put 3 or 4 sprays on the mitt at first and then of course thought if 3-4 looks that good then 4-5 will be great.</li>
            <li> I get too hot laying out anyways, so this product is perfect for keeping my skin safe and getting me that</li>
            <li> This stuff applies flawlessly, dries within 5 minutes, has a realistic color and does not reek.  </li>
            <li> I went overboard my first time and it looked not so good lol.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best self tanners for the price and results and there&#x27;s no reason to spend hours laying out and damaging your skin by the sun when you can get an awesome tan really quickly</li>
            <li> If you absolutely think tan is beautiful then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and is so easy to apply.  </li>

            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> By far the best self tanner on the market.</li>
            <li> WOW, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Natural looking color and the best part</li>
            <li> The instant color it provides is a great application guide, and the smell is the best of any self tanner I&#x27;ve used - light, tropical, almost coconut scented.</li>
            <li> I also read a lot of reviews saying to spray the product on your skin then rub it in because it&#x27;s definitely more effective</li>
            <li> but then a nice tan for the rest of the week :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this product works great for me - plus it actually smells good which is a first for a tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Smooth application and build able - scent is pleasant-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like it as much b/c its a liquid spray, not foam, like the St. Tropez, but it works perfectly well and blends easily.</li>
            <li> It does a good job if you are wanting a quick nice tan</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to apply, smells good and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, zero streaking, beautiful color and no bad smell.  </li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and looks great right away.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t be intimidated like I was over using a spray, it really is easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with the mitt included and looks natural...love it!</li>
            <li> but it dries VERY quickly!  </li>
            <li> Plus not to mention the MIT that comes with it for easy application!</li>

            <li> Easy to use as well!</li>

            <li> i was surprised abd verry satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and smells good!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for $30 at a salon and loved it.</li>
            <li> This product really does work good!</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned person and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow, this updated product is even better, and I thought it was GREAT already!  </li>
            <li> This is ideal for making an even skin tone, goes on quick , smells good, dries fast and works.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning products and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used .  </li>
            <li> The spray and mitt are good but for me it came across streaky and it is very time consuming without good</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how easily it applies and it does look natural and nice color.  </li>
            <li> This is by the far the best and most natural-looking tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had no orange streaks, only a nice even tan--it even worked great on my face!</li>
            <li> (so you eon&#x27;t miss a spot) is a great color on its own and is wearable throughout the day itself without being sticky or transferring (if you really want to be bronzed).</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, will definitely purchase again, when needed.  </li>
            <li> Great product, great price, maybe get a different mitt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Looked really good and the tone was a nice golden bronzey tan not orange.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products on the market and this one was by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is THE BEST , most natural, tanned look, I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best self-tanner i have used so far, i prefer it over st-tropez and many others...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanning products over the years &amp; this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, creates a super natural looking tan that lasts days, smells great, not sticky or tacky, awesome price.</li>
            <li> excellent product for a quick flawless tan especially for your legs that don&#x27;t get color as quick when</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and dont have much luck with self tanners but this one has a really great color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best self tanner I have used, and I have used many.</li>
            <li> Great product, good natural color.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I have tried many spay self tanners and this is by far the best i have ever tried!</li>
            <li> The tan is no too brown, and not too golden; it is a perfect golden color.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it doesn&#x27;t really streak and gives a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to add that the color isn&#x27;t orange like most products, it gives you a perfectly brown, natural look.</li>
            <li> The mitt makes it very easy to apply all over your body more evenly than hands alone.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and I love the fact that I can see where it is going while putting it on.</li>
            <li> I love how it comes with gloves and a mitt - makes it very easy to apply evenly and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hands being stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both give a beautiful tan, but on my light skin, I found that the original works better.</li>
            <li> I would suggest exfoliating really well and using a light application working up to the amount of tan desired (using very light around fingers, arm creases, etc), I also used it before going in the sun which gave best results.</li>
            <li> Great color and very real looking.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and love the mit that comes with it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, make sure you use the gloves!</li>
            <li> Not 5 stars because it faded pretty quickly, but if you want to look tan for a party or event, this stuff is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and this gave me a nice all over warmth that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li> I love it very good no mess!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, it went on great, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;, waited about 5 to 6 days</li>
            <li> I gave myself a five o&#x27; clock shadow the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li> in fact, my husband even complemented me on how great I looked &amp; that doesn&#x27;t happen often ;)</li>
            <li> Works just as great as my first bottle.</li>
            <li> My first try at self tanning and this stuff is great</li>
            <li> This product looks great when first applying, but after a day or two begins to spot.</li>
            <li> After that I can barely notice any sent at all, which is perfect!</li>
            <li> This works very well and blends beautifully on my skin.</li>
            <li> I might try the darker one soon, but this is pretty great.</li>
            <li> This is by-far the best tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used, even my boyfriend approves, and he HATES self tanners because im generally smelly and orange.</li>
            <li> GreAt product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty great for a home self tanner.</li>
            <li> woke up to a beautiful tan that looks real .</li>
            <li> happy I&#x27;m glowing ;)</li>
            <li> The color is great at first.....</li>
            <li> Like it , creates even and beautiful color but way too much Maintenance.</li>
            <li> Great product, lasts a whole season!</li>
            <li> I tried it out yesterday for the first time, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as potent as the Flawless, and the Fair is harder to have saturate the skin.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have always struggled getting a natural looking glow and not turning out looking like a tiger striped Dorito.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and it&#x27;s a beautiful and natural tanning color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy with this stuff - I will be buying this as my main tanner from now on!</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product....</li>
            <li> and I love the color.  </li>
            <li> I get a lovely bronze color.</li>
            <li> I would love it if it came with a nozzle like the misleading picture</li>
            <li> The company needs to take care of this issue as I would have givin this product more stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT and will NOT go without it from here on out.</li>
            <li> We are getting better and faster with the application process.  </li>
            <li> Make sure not to have any lotions/moisturizers on the skin before applying.</li>
            <li> you get your skin the better.</li>
            <li> So this is a safe way to have that California Kissed Skin look.</li>
            <li> so i dont need to apply more then twice a week.</li>
            <li> LOVE the mit.  </li>
            <li> It smells and applies great, but if your looking for a very brown tan I would go with the million dollar tan products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this gets better with more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> , make sure you stay out of the rain and puddles...</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan.</li>
            <li> Love the mitt - I wash it after each use</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than Mystic tan or any spray tans I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... try it.</li>
            <li> smell is okay</li>
            <li> I think this tanner mostly \\&quot;stains\\</li>
            <li> absolutely love the color.  </li>
            <li> But love this too now.  </li>
            <li> did use this on my face, but I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 6-7 hours more like 1-2.</li>
            <li> But the actual product is brilliant!</li>
            <li> It goes on more like a stain than a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I like the stain better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Goes on even, nice light scent and lasts longer than others.</li>
            <li> I would also make for sure to use the glove that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I love that this one came with the mitt and gloves.</li>
            <li> Love using the mitt.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my fiance&#x27;</li>
            <li> I apply a second coat after my shower and just get wonderful results :)</li>
            <li> it leaks though if the bottle turns over and mine got knocked over and most of it spilled out.</li>
            <li> if you purchase make sure to set the bottle someplace it wont get knocked over.</li>
            <li> it goes on better if you do.</li>
            <li> decided to give it one more shot.</li>
            <li> Also, this product smells much better than all others and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have never found any self tanner that has worked better than this.</li>
            <li> My arms where already darker and did get the most color.</li>
            <li> im in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> but over all ok</li>
            <li> but I must say I absolutely love this Tanner</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, so most self-tanners turn me freakishly orange.</li>
            <li> The box says that it is safe to use on your face, however it broke me out...</li>
            <li> but when I washed it off there was a lot more brown in the water.</li>
            <li> I felt I saved more product that way because the mitt soakes up a lot.of product,  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt it comes with.</li>
            <li> Ordered more</li>
            <li> I love the mitt and the ease of application.</li>
            <li> Maybe its more of a gradual tan?</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> found it looks 10 times better than a salon tan.</li>
            <li> So, I have tried many self tanners over the years.</li>
            <li> I now have a gorgeous golden tan, too.</li>
            <li> I love the way I look when I&#x27;m tan</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> There are not enough good things I could say about this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products (I still LOVE million dollar tan)</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> The best time to use this self tanner is after exfoliating your skin when the pores are open.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> This is much more convenient and safer than laying in the sun or a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I found this sooner.</li>
            <li> and I am sure no one is staring at my legs anyhow.</li>
            <li> However after using this stuff, I have to say that I think it works better than the spray, and much better than anything I had used before as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the color and ease that it goes on.</li>
            <li> A piece of advice though, make sure you use the mitt that they provide.</li>
            <li> It is easier to use with the pad and covers more area with the use of the pad.  </li>
            <li> It works okay...</li>
            <li> although it did start to look better after a couple of showers.</li>
            <li> Talk about an instant flawless tan in seconds.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I have NO complaints whatsoever. :)</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 25% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid]]and</li>
            <li> Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground.</li>
            <li> wish I would have gone through more than one application before writing my review.</li>
            <li> This product is better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever have had.</li>
            <li> It applies better, smells better, drys better and lasts longer at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> She is stunning.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a pump spray.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> Applied more than once also just to be sure I was applying correctly and it wasn&#x27;t a gradual process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure more to come.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> :) I will defiently be getting more</li>
            <li> /&gt;the color is believable</li>
            <li> BUT there might be better mitts out there</li>
            <li> ok, a lot.</li>
            <li> I have also found that most self tanners cause me to break out if used on my face.  </li>
            <li> Although, I am sure I am losing some of the product to absorbtion into the mitt.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Which by the way I love that it has a color guide so you can tell were you have already applied it.</li>
            <li> SO SO many sunless tanners and they have always had their cons,</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased and will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Best instant tanning spray ever.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Word of caution, make sure you use a scrub.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Better then the risk of tanning beds or even the sun.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> If you use astringent with cotton ball, most of what is on your face comes off on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
            <li> Upon using it the 1st time, spilled some on my house dress &amp; bed sheets, didn&#x27;t wash them for over 24 hours &amp; was sure it would stain, it did not stain either item at all.  </li>
            <li> but I have better ones that wear more evenly).</li>
            <li> I have tried many options over the years</li>
            <li> Even my most hard-core tanning friends don&#x27;t like tanning every day because their products are a hassle</li>
            <li> Make sure you specifically do circular motions or it&#x27;ll make you blotchy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a product better that absorbs into your skin and</li>
            <li> It went on ok</li>
            <li> After reading countless excellent reviews for this product, I purchased one box.  </li>
            <li> Arms look ok.  </li>
            <li> Will try the lotion &amp; see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews about this product</li>
            <li> If your thinking about buying, try it--You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It really makes like you have a great tan with out the sun.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and I will be placing an order soon for another bottle just to be sure not to run out.</li>
            <li> for the price you&#x27;d think they have better spray pump on this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking sexy.</li>
            <li> I am just glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.</li>
            <li> But I still love it.</li>
            <li> And you do have to make sure to stay away from water until your tan has set for about 15 minutes to be safe.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate before hand and</li>
            <li> the night before you apply the tanner make sure you put body butter or hydrating lotion to your knees, elbows, and decolletage</li>
            <li> (make sure you close your eyes) and one mist on neck.  </li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners and never been satisfied with the results like I am with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> , I love that it doesn&#x27;t stink like a lot of the tanners do.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I&#x27;ve found is that you need to order more applying mitts.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate before using this product, because your tan will be a lot more even and look nicer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, most of it will come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I get when I use this tanner I get compliments on how healthy and glowy I look.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> I am about to order more</li>
            <li> NO ORANGE! :)</li>
            <li> Not an orangish hue like most.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure you wear the latex gloves under the mit.  </li>
            <li> I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> My legs look slimmer and more defined.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve been laying in the sun :)</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Omg I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love everything from the ease of application to the smell and the color it gives.</li>
            <li> sure you do not use this when you have any lotion, creams or oils on, it will not work on those areas.</li>
            <li> It works best if you exfoliate in the shower and use lotion when you get out- especially on areas like knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li> Mostly all self-tanners leave either a smelly, streaky &amp; orange tint on your skin, but this didn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Also be sure to bend your elbows and knees when you apply it there.  </li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I have used many different products throughout the years, and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better.</li>
            <li> This is great if you want fast results and arent planning on being splashed or swimming.</li>
            <li> so make sure you moisturize, it seems to work even better.</li>
            <li> I made sure to exfoliate the day before</li>
            <li> :) I will deffintly buy this again.</li>
            <li> After reading some more reviews I find out</li>
            <li> I can even make it better with blending balm</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be able to wash it off in time.</li>
            <li> Everything else looks 100 times better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanning products and the Fakebake is the best.  </li>
            <li> I found it worked better if I exfoliated with the Baiden mitt.  </li>
            <li> Its just okay would not buy again</li>
            <li> tan (because of the color guide) and could tell everywhere that I applied the product to make sure I applied it evenly.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Coppertone Sunless Tanning Lotion which leaves a much more noticeable tan.  </li>
            <li> i love that its a liquid and comes with a applicator mitt.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much i love this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li> Looks better on my arms than on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners before--creams, towels, sprays--and this blew my mind.  </li>
            <li> No streaks, great color, dries really fast.</li>
            <li> ..my husband said it made my skin look even and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The more you put on the darker it will be.  </li>
            <li> Not being able to go in the sun, I consider my self a connoisseur of self tanners.</li>
            <li> Posting some photos so you can read and see more about this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This one worked well although it didn&#x27;t come with an applicator and was a bit more orange/ yellowy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> (Maybe more than needed.)</li>
            <li> It should absorb better on the face.</li>
            <li> (Maybe more than needed.)</li>
            <li> It should absorb better on the face.</li>
            <li> Best results are achieved by following the directions and applying before bed and letting it work overnight--personally, I apply it 1 to 1.5 hours before bed to give it time to &amp;</li>
            <li> In a pinch, I have also been able to apply this in the morning before heading out and while I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that, I didn&#x27;t look orange.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You do need to apply more than once for desired shade.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff is wonderful for a light natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> AND they forgot to add the spray bottle top.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the gloves and the mitt concept because I never have to wash my hands and worry about my hands being orange afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since the feet have too many curves it won&#x27;t apply evenly and will turn out blotchy.  </li>
            <li> and you get many uses out of one bottle</li>
            <li> It provids a color that many people compliment.</li>
            <li> so many self tanning products just make me look orange.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with how many times a week to use this.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would be better since it has a mitt included in the box.  </li>
            <li> I may need to figure out a better way to apply it though.  </li>
            <li> but I decided a while back that it wasn&#x27;t the best thing for me</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I love the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> #34;fake bake airbrush.&amp;#34; I love this product.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the mitt and just kept going from bottom to top.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink and it is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and this is my fav</li>
            <li> I would also recommend Body Drench, but I think I like this even better.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t it will not go on smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many tanning products.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than a spray tan...</li>
            <li> I almost canceled my order but now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been using self-tanners since I was in the 6th grade, which is um 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ve noticed the more you put on</li>
            <li> so I had my lovely husband help me apply this on</li>
            <li> WILL ORDER SOME MORE AS SOON AS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> This spring, I thought to myself, instead of looking so pasty for the all of spring and most of summer, maybe I should give this a go.</li>
            <li> I could not tell you if this product is better</li>
            <li> I look better with this tan than i ever looked.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that isn&#x27;t streaky or orange.</li>
            <li> The solution, no mater how many times I sprayed onto the mitt for each limb, never soaked through the mitt onto my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the results I got from this.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you do the commonsense prep work before applying it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, make sure to wash the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li> but it works better if you just spray it on your skin :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love that season...</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> But overall its great for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this tanner.</li>
            <li> Would love to use this again</li>
            <li> As others I have tried many a self tanning product.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> a better bottle will arrive)&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> However, this tanner smells like the Hawaiian tropic tanning oil we all know and love,</li>
            <li> I really was hopeful about this product after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews that said IT HAS NO SMELL....</li>
            <li> They more you apply, the darker you go.</li>
            <li> provides the rubber gloves, but you do have to watch to make sure you don&#x27;t leave any streaks.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to get</li>
            <li> favorite tanner  love it</li>
            <li> I love this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> No nasty smell or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> May give it one more try.</li>
            <li> The bronzer gives you an immediate healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The bronzer gives you an immediate healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have tried million different self tanners, and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can see where you put it on and</li>
            <li> No nasty self-tanner smell; the product smells like coconut!</li>
            <li> I love the color this puts on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and turned out really well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> But best color of an instant tanning product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Although I love the sun I feel as though using this is also a healthier option.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This product comes with pump spray top and the application mit (with st tropez the mit is an additional $10).</li>
            <li> Even better, when it fades it doesn&#x27;t leave me splotchy.  </li>
            <li> guess that&#x27;s what husbands are for :)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you rinse the mitt in the sink between uses.</li>
            <li> I love that you do not turn orange with this</li>
            <li> This is much easier to apply and smells great.</li>
            <li> This works okay -</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells ok..</li>
            <li> Nothing more ok stuff</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast service.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a bit more gel texture to it.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless has been the perfect answer to my tanning woes.</li>
            <li> I had used about 1/2 the product or more</li>
            <li> but this was over the top.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d give it one more try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite of all the tanning prouducts I have ever used!And</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash the glove.</li>
            <li> It also smells like coconut, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can make it lighter or darker by how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li> This product works like it&#x27;s supposed to. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have used so many brands of self-tanner since I stopped using tanning beds 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li> it is just absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> apply more.</li>
            <li> The glove gave me no problem with shedding and I washed it every so many uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one if the better self tanners out there in terms of ease and color.</li>
            <li> For the price, I feel it should be more low-maintenance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too, kind-of beachy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanner and it works great,easy application</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> and I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If you love being tanned this is the product you need.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this</li>
            <li> The mitt it comes with is also great because it really smooths the liquid over your skin evenly.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> What more can I ask? :)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and even!</li>
            <li> all my friends asked me where I been tanning the results show up immediately I love this stuff I will buy this again</li>
            <li> i love the mitt and gloves.</li>
            <li> So, I will try a couple more brands for that area specifically.</li>
            <li> I love this this stuff.</li>
            <li> otherwise the mitt tends to absorb it and you have to use more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak and I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Much more involved than the lore</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate as directed.</li>
            <li> Make sure to put on at night and wash off in morning.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love that you can see it going on and</li>
            <li> It also gets into pores on my chest and stains them making them more visible as well as getting into my hair follicles on my legs.  </li>
            <li> will buy again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better and I like the tan but don&#x27;t want to be out in the sun because cancer runs in my family.  </li>
            <li> then when you shower after 6-9 hours most of it does come off.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> But if you are, your results should be fantastic!</li>
            <li> It dries so fast, smells great and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to exercise this year</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I turned my Sister and niece on to this product and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I still have yet to find anything I really love.  </li>
            <li> It gives even, healthy tan without orange.  </li>
            <li> Will order again before ever tryin another orange sunless tanner!!! :)</li>
            <li> but I love ware skirts</li>
            <li> - will use it forever - love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It really works well and the color is great.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, after reading one review I did cut the tube to the spray top shorter.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, although, if it went on as a color you could see better where you missed or need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Make sure you watch Youtube videos about application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I love the mitt that comes with this.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many products I have raved about to friends and family, but this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> No nasty smell.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt to put it on with to keep my hands from staining.  </li>
            <li> Works flawlessly for me personally.</li>
            <li> I loved having that golden glow</li>
            <li> If you use it at night like they suggest it does provide better coverage.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice, even, light color on the skin though.  </li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> the more you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better to apply it with latex gloves</li>
            <li> For me, I am very happy that I am a &#x27;darker shade of white&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I use Tinted Love moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love this product, but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> This has more of a brown color that compliments my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the tan.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend doing this as mine works perfectly now!  </li>
            <li> Be sure and wear the included gloves along with the mit.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments after using this,</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is probably one of the best self tanners I have used.  </li>
            <li> (I love to go bed</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners...</li>
            <li> are the reasons I love this self-tanner:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> mostly gradual tanning lotions like Jergens.</li>
            <li> My father passed away from melanoma and I&#x27;m terrified of being in the sun, but I love having a tan.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate throughly before you use this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and it practically dries instantly!</li>
            <li> (anyone have a better recommendation?)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hands, a washcloth, and a sponge as backups, and they were all hilarious jokes.</li>
            <li> I wish the mitt lasted as longas the bottle did, because I do not wish to spend even more money on a backup applicator method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> Dries quicker than most.</li>
            <li> you might look more faked than baked.</li>
            <li> It has the most undetectable scent it&#x27;s like a mix of coconut and vanilla</li>
            <li> Im not too sure what the gloves are for</li>
            <li> but my shower I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to write this review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this self tanner one, but I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with sunless tanning before but this product actually works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was probably user error, so</li>
            <li> I will say I got better color pay off with the gloves than the mitt, so I would recommend using the gloves all over and maybe the mitt for your hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Even wore it for engagement pictures. :)</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless goes on, well flawless, with no streaks!</li>
            <li> My favorite fake-bake self tanner.</li>
            <li> I prefer this spray formula over the foam and lotion, and I love that it comes with an application mitt.</li>
            <li> but instead it made the scaly spots even darker and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to have a tan without the problems a real suntan create.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect tanning product!  </li>
            <li> but it only takes 30 seconds to put on and the application glove is one of the best I&#x27;ve used for spray on tan.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I love about amazon..  </li>
            <li> the spray top no longer worked</li>
            <li> and I was hoping the spray would stay on better.</li>
            <li> Favorite self-tanner, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Also, exfoliate before use AND MAKE SURE YOU SHAVE BEFORE YOU APPLY THIS.</li>
            <li> This more seemed to just paint over my body.</li>
            <li> and that was a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t turn orange like most others.</li>
            <li> I love the glove.</li>
            <li> many sites pointed to Fake Bake Flawless as one of the best at home NON ORANGE tan you could do at home.</li>
            <li> but, heck what was one more orange glow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love the mitt and the way it applies.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a better color on me.</li>
            <li> Love it...does not streak.</li>
            <li> just make sure to get even coverage</li>
            <li> Love the tropical smell.</li>
            <li> Love this tanner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great brown color with no orangey color at all!</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> The color pay-off of this product is not the best, though it says you can reapply multiple times to deepen the color.</li>
            <li> I cannot take any more sun, and I don&#x27;t need to with this product</li>
            <li> My favorite things about this product: 1)</li>
            <li> It smells more like a coconut/tropical scented lotion, and I don&#x27;t find it to be overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> and I have more complaints than praises when it comes to this</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this product would be better?</li>
            <li> Believable color.</li>
            <li> Be sure to scrub it all off before applying another go around.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have to tell you...</li>
            <li> buy it, I promise you will love it</li>
            <li> The brown mist seems to get everywhere when spraying so be sure to use this in the shower (not while showering)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> Love this tanner.</li>
            <li> , I love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> And the part I love most is it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes.</li>
            <li> I reapply every so many days, or nightly for a darker tan.</li>
            <li> and I get a day of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Gives you a beautiful tan.&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy but the color on your skin after application is beautiful</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best self-tanner I have ever purchased, definitely my HG self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I love the price of this product and i will defintely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not orange like many self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Turns skin a more brown tinged tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t smell like so many self tanners do.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better to apply it two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> I have had so many complements.</li>
            <li> fabulous tan!</li>
            <li> Love the color and ease of application.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> but it is more work than spray on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased</li>
            <li> The more you put on, the darker you get</li>
            <li> Only wash with soap with your hand or you will wash off your beautiful tan!!  </li>
            <li> The more you keep your skin hydrated the longer</li>
            <li> but that time on that fabric it was okay.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak even on the top of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> I use the product, I love the product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something more long-term, I would look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> It literally DOES NOT get any better than this product.</li>
            <li> I applied on day 1 and then day 3 to try to get a more baked look but the additional application didn&#x27;t produce more color.</li>
            <li> it always made you look spotty and orange, this Fake Bake Flawless is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use an exfoliating sugar or salt scrub before use.</li>
            <li> After buying countless others, I will not use anything else but this.&lt;br /&gt;The mit and gloves it comes with is perfect.</li>
            <li> Mitt is interesting and can be helpful to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pinker toned, I think this will look even more orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to apply to lips and eyelids</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I get so many complements on my tan.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better tanners I&#x27;ve ran into.  </li>
            <li> I was hopping for something slightly more drastic.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it still has an odor, but it is more tropical than the tell tale sunless tanner smell most give off.</li>
            <li> Love this tanner.</li>
            <li> was OK</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s building color gradually &amp; totally believably.  </li>
            <li> I love the buffing mitt idea</li>
            <li> I am a pasty white redhead, and this gives me wonderfully even, brown color.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with the mitt</li>
            <li> so you are able to apply the product evenly.</li>
            <li> more of a brownish shade, the scent is a bit offensive, and the cost is so much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d argue that, when used properly, this is the best sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> This will keep it in MUCH better</li>
            <li> 2: Take some scissors and snip off a bit more than an inch of the spray bottle attachment that came with the product, and put the modified attachment onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it and was ok with it if I tanned well, but I am both tan and NOT  SMELLY!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It blends wonderfully, it wears well, and the color builds with daily applications.</li>
            <li> Love that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Would not wash out like most.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanning products over the years, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Ok lets just start off..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 15 self tanners in the last 2 years or so and have not been impressed by any.</li>
            <li> I believe I do better with a creamier consistency, as it is easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, guess it&#x27;s ok if you spray a lot on.</li>
            <li> this product is okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt because it makes everything go on even.</li>
            <li> Just put on the cute, purple, rubber gloves, 2.)</li>
            <li> Smells more like a lotion used for getting in the tanner bed, rather then those smelly gradual tanners like Jergens e</li>
            <li> DEFINATELY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always washed out except for one workout top that I had to throw away.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> sure and use the mitt and gloves included.  </li>
            <li> I put mine on the top of a lotion bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product works just like it says.</li>
            <li> Will not turn you &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and the applicator mitt helps with making sure that I won&#x27;t be streaky.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something authentic looking and without a smell.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I tan in a bed, in my opinion this stuff saves you money and is better for your skin.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I can avoid going to tanning beds year-round.</li>
            <li> so tanning beds and laying out like most girls aren&#x27;t an option</li>
            <li> get it ppeople :)</li>
            <li> This product gives me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Awesome especially in winter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I wait hours after my shower just to be sure.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on for 48 hours you can scrub and your tan will not be affected which is why I love this product.</li>
            <li> sure you apply it more generously to paler areas</li>
            <li> This is better</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better luck and nicer results with ULTA sunless tanning spray and Neutrogena Micro Mist.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply at night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li> You can even use this in the morning, before work or school, although most would recommend applying at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use it on your face, just make sure you use one spray on the mitt and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget your ears and hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can fix it by just applying more, but just makes the process longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love how brown the color is, versus the &#x27;orange&#x27; effect that DHA (sunless tanner) can sometimes give.</li>
            <li> You will probably LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and i should blend it in more with the mitt</li>
            <li> I get to know it, I&#x27;ll give more information on this item experiencing</li>
            <li> Most importantly, THERE ISN&#x27;T AN ORANGE STREAK IN SIGHT!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, like most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate before you use this, &amp; keep your skin MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and works better than any tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I love that it colors you immediately.</li>
            <li> Nothing get my tanner, and in the most even way.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wear the latex gloves with the mit you get with the bottle</li>
            <li> Do not be dettered, its like most things...</li>
            <li> That is better then</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Ive tried many many many sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> product I give 5 stars and the shipper I give 4.5 stars :)</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t irritated, I look healthy and tanned and feel amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> night I immediately bought 2 more bottles, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to look like a lovely shade of oompa loompa before an event I was looking forward to.</li>
            <li> Just a tip- make sure to wash the mitt after every application or you will ruin it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure beforehand to cover elbows, knees, hands with some sort of lotion, i prefer hemp lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most self tanners)</li>
            <li> This the product left best color i have ever had from self tanner!</li>
            <li> I love the spray in the tan can that this brand has.</li>
            <li> its one was ok for my legs</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> it is my favorite self-tanner</li>
            <li> Love the mint and color.</li>
            <li> I think it does give you more of a brown color than this does.</li>
            <li> This for me is more brown/bronze color.</li>
            <li> , I think I like the lotions better.</li>
            <li> And, I have used many, many.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love the price and the look the product gives.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> And love that it is tinted so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a safe alternative to tanning in beds during the off-season</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying more than one time every week or so.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite self tanners.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can express how much I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better than my tanning bed tan.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most of the color washed away with one shower.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to shave and exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic self-tanner!</li>
            <li> But this company is definitely the best I&#x27;ve found out of many, many, many self-tanning products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the color it gives me.</li>
            <li> Will buy more and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> to apply - love the mitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big money saver and great results!</li>
            <li> I like the product &amp; the color, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> The diluted lotion goes on even, you just have to use it more often.</li>
            <li> I watched youtube videos and read a lot of the reviews just to make sure it was going to be a good self tanner and worth my money.</li>
            <li> My legs looked okay</li>
            <li> .. there weren&#x27;t as many streaks on them as there was my arms.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this bc all the reviews and youtube videos</li>
            <li> I considered hitting a tanning bed but that would conflict with my healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground.</li>
            <li> also smells like Malibu rum &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many tanning products, believe me.</li>
            <li> so I could confidently wear shorts</li>
            <li> but i love it will order more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s semi-fixable if you apply more so for that I take off one star.</li>
            <li> and it was BETTER</li>
            <li> Going to put it on one more night</li>
            <li> the summer- used in spring and was satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I love not getting it on my hands, and I&#x27;ve been rinsing it out per another review.</li>
            <li> I thought surely this is the product for me.</li>
            <li> With no time to actually go get spray tanned and wanting to get the best value for my dollar, I thought this product was for sure the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I literally got it about 40 minutes ago.</li>
            <li> maybe i need to work on it more?</li>
            <li> I have not found a better self tanner out there and have been using it intermittently since 2013.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your mitt in the washer every once in a while, and I try to rinse my mitt after every application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reccomended this product to many of my friends and clients.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better than this.</li>
            <li> Love the mitten.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this stuff &amp; so does my husband.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product I use it every two days, the color is a bronze color.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> No streaks no horrible odor!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t sweat AT ALL while putting this on, it&#x27;ll run and get on everything.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a great glow i havent put so much on</li>
            <li> love the fact you can build the color up to how you want it.</li>
            <li> but I found spraying it directing onto my body and then rubbing it in works much better,</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wear gloves under the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that it has the color guide in it</li>
            <li> love love love this product.</li>
            <li> My arms and chest have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling slimy.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars, because it is better than most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted more on the bronze/brown side.</li>
            <li> Now, it took two applications to get a nice light tan that I wanted.</li>
            <li> the body exfoliation, I just used my exfoliating mitts, You can find them on Amazon or at the drugstore and should not cost more than $3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaints here just that i will be purchasing more as soon as i run out :-)</li>
            <li> Love the glove that come with it so that it keep the product off your hands.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Jergens.</li>
            <li> and I seriously LOVE this self tanner.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer part will wash off, but you will still have a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh was a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on the tan, for sure.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought 2 bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> The color indicator (and most of the smell) will shower off in the morning.</li>
            <li> and make sure you don&#x27;t miss spots.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and the applicator glove that goes with it.</li>
            <li> 3 stars mostly for the mitt.</li>
            <li> The tanner itself is ok</li>
            <li> I like this product, but am not in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love that a mitt is included.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really was happy with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> They must need to improve the top, perhaps some form of gasket to seal it better.</li>
            <li> I simply love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasons I love it</li>
            <li> I would spray more (for example for a sunkissed look I would do maybe about 4 sprays on each arm, if I want a more bronzed look I would do 6 sprays)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use lotions or oils before applying.</li>
            <li> Hint; cut off about 3/4 inch of spray tube so that it fits better in the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did this on a day</li>
            <li> guide color looks better than the tan.</li>
            <li> will buy more.</li>
            <li> Meaning that the cost for this product is better than most.  </li>
            <li> i think the color left is beautiful and it does not streak!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this purchase and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I was able to darken 4 shades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure people think I&#x27;m in the tanning beds a lot to maintain bronze skin but</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely more has leaked out than I have been able to use</li>
            <li> I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> The product did what it was supposed to...make me look tan, but it accentuated my flaws more than make me look better.</li>
            <li> ; smell after a couple of hours, contrary to what most of the reviews said.</li>
            <li> Love the product , but will never buy it online again.  </li>
            <li> Best to use at night then wash off the coloring that is used to guide during application the following morning.  </li>
            <li> Seems to do better that way.  </li>
            <li> (so glad I did)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a deep sun kissed tan an looks great!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with fakebake that I knew I had to write a review.</li>
            <li> I spend a fair amount of time outside, in Florida, and have never been able to get a great tan.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Most people can&#x27;t tell that i just have sunless tanner on.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this color, it&#x27;s not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt AND the rubber gloves</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> , i added some more today</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The kits comes with everything you need to get a believable tan, with my threat of being orange.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to put on any kind of lotion before applying, so I just got the mitt the littlest bit wet under the sink &amp; re-rubbed in the areas that were getting streaky &amp; it worked awesome.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I get so many complements on how tan I look.  </li>
            <li> Adding 2 at once(waiting until one dries and apply again) looks much better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still able to wash off any residue so none of the coloring gets on my clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You Can See , The Product Has More Pros Than Cons ,</li>
            <li> Because I Probably Applied Too Many Layers .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner, doesn&#x27;t steak, splotch, turn orange.</li>
            <li> I love the price and it includes a mitt and rubber gloves.</li>
            <li> w/elbows &amp; knuckles, be sure to bend so that you get the product in the creases.</li>
            <li> So many people complimented my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; and when I told them it was a self tanner</li>
            <li> LOVE it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used self tanner in about 15 years or more....</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions mostly.</li>
            <li> I put on the cute purple gloves sprayed the product onto the glove and started buffing the product on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend it:)</li>
            <li> the more orange/streaky</li>
            <li> it might work better.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it smells like pina colada during application, then once it dries it has almost no smell at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak and I love that it has the applicator mit.  </li>
            <li> Then most of it washed off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> of most self tanners.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li> Love the mit it comes with.</li>
            <li> and I am sure it is just that I have not mastered applying it to my hands yet.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and will use just this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> By day 2, however, it&#x27;s faded and looks better.</li>
            <li> Can still be a man - with a tan..., much better than a tanning booth in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> This product is  way more affordable, if you have doubts just try it, $20 is a bargain</li>
            <li> and you get more than one application out of it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you read the application instructions and follow accordingly.</li>
            <li> I actually really love the color of this product and have been using it for about a week now.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever tried, and I have tried many different kinds.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; helps with even distribution and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many over the years, and this product blows them ALL out of the water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself going without this tanner :)</li>
            <li> The foam mit ios genius. :)</li>
            <li> &quot; (gave 4 stars because contrary to most comments, after a day or two, it does have a tinge of orange.</li>
            <li> 1- cut 1 inch off the bottom of sprayer tube (helps with the leaking most people report.</li>
            <li> 2- make sure you are showered, exfoliated, BUT NOT MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li> If you follow this I promise it will come out better.</li>
            <li> wish they had gallon containers of it :)</li>
            <li> I love applying it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s probably magic)</li>
            <li> I will apply more tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m glad that I Bought this tanner.</li>
            <li> However, I still wanted a tan because everyone looks and feel better tanned.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> However, the next day I looked like I had been out in the sun the day before and had an awesome tan.</li>
            <li> so just applied more and dressed for work.</li>
            <li> Although it takes too many coats for me to be satisfied with the color</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I think my favorite feature is that there&#x27;s bronzer in it, which means that you can see it as it goes on,</li>
            <li> The applicator mitt allows for an even application every time, and the guide color helps me make sure I don&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li> So glad I looked at reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> and this is more of a brown versus orange</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen many streaks.</li>
            <li> If it would continue to look like it does before a shower I would like it even better.  </li>
            <li> but I still maintained a lovely glow.</li>
            <li> Better than most</li>
            <li> I have fluorescent white skin but the color ended up looking great!</li>
            <li> and you can also check to make sure everything is coated evenly to avoid blotching or streaks.</li>
            <li> I will say the smell is most of what I like about it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have already ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, your luck will be better than mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more brown than orange, so it looks more like a suntan than a self-tan.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you shower the morning after you put this stuff on.</li>
            <li> You can see where you apply it too and the mitt is especially handy when doing your back.</li>
            <li> and I will reorder. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried too many others, all in vain.</li>
            <li> used twice a week and keeps a nice light tan color.</li>
            <li> the color was great and didn&#x27;t streak much.  </li>
            <li> I love my self tanner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tanner...</li>
            <li> Be sure to put a towel in your bed if you decide to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; your tan at night or it will rub off on your sheets.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this tanner.  </li>
            <li> Interesting, because I couldn&#x27;t locate a sell by or use by date anywhere on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The color is the best,,,,,,, no yellow or orange color...</li>
            <li> Most of all I like the smell which has a hint of chocolate.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the top review</li>
            <li> :) 3.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had many compliments and inquiries as too the amount of time i&#x27;m spending in the sun---</li>
            <li> But the most noticeable downfall is the payout ;it is ok if you don&#x27;t shower......</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> They must&#x27;ve been planted cause I&#x27;ve been using self-tanner for years and am always on the lookout for better stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner, better than St Tropez</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except it did settle into the pores in my lower legs and it looked like I had a lot more freckles than I have</li>
            <li> - I used a q-tip on the darker freckles and the color came off, so I felt better.  </li>
            <li> In the shower, I made sure to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I will take my hard-earned money to a company who deserves it and has better products.    </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and tips and this is an ok product.</li>
            <li> love this product....</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> It does, however, smell much better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> More of a stain than a self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I decided to have an airbrushed tan done hoping for better results...</li>
            <li> I do, however recommend the product itself!pray on tans and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> This is also the 1st tanner that I can apply (gently pat) to my hands &amp; they even turn out great.</li>
            <li> So make sure to apply when you&#x27;ve got time away from all water.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you will have better luck than I did, but my advice.</li>
            <li> Keep looking elsewhere for a better product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and was even warned about it from a dermatologist until I told him it was a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t wash off most of the tan.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I found it best that after i am done rubbing it in, my last swipes i try to make my hair on my arms/legs &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li> as of now, i&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product and would suggest it to a friend (who knows how to keep secrets)....</li>
            <li> celebrities do it, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> well i just want to look better and healthier</li>
            <li> This product made the light freckles across my shins and ankles POP!  </li>
            <li> and I love the tanning mitt</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure -</li>
            <li> I love this one and the darker one.</li>
            <li> I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> So glad that I found it here at a better price.  </li>
            <li> I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> Im really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply the product in the morning and wear it all throughout the day without looking orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love love love this product</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product, after reading MANY reviews, in an attempt to find a substitute for the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Now, I love being able to put a layer or two of this stuff on before going out at night</li>
            <li> As I said before I had read many reviews and decided to trust in those that said all that washes off is some &amp;#34;color guard&amp;#34; or whatever...</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan to continue buying their products.</li>
            <li> and I love the mit to use for application.</li>
            <li> Some of them made me look like an Oompa Loompa, others didn&#x27;t appear to do anything, and others were just okay.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have been using ST TROPEZ mousse for a couple years and love the color</li>
            <li> I love this product, gone</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> LOVE this self tanner for so many reasons.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t been something I&#x27;ve been able to fix.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this tanning spray.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used much better self tanner and of course paid more...</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to not look like a carrot and not smell funky.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll look more radiant too since your skin will be hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your mitt and exfoliate 1 time per week.  </li>
            <li> Fake bake flawless is incredible!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is SO MUCH BETTER than any gradual tanning lotion you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt...</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconuts which I love.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions you will have a believable looking tan.</li>
            <li> I love the kae exfoliating hamman glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> In the spring and summer I will do most of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did that and was able to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is a lot better for your skin than tanning, and a lot better for your lungs than a spray tan.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconut and not at all like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it was a spray and not lotion.  </li>
            <li> The Flawless is my second favorite product of their line.</li>
            <li> Flawless is the opposite.</li>
            <li> If my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , one more thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!!for my hair</li>
            <li> I do love that it comes with the mitt to rub it in</li>
            <li> Will reorder :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably every drugstore brand self tanner on the market, and was never even close to being satisfied with any of them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is actually the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried for the price.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is you can see what areas you&#x27;ve tanned because it has color guard.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> the mitt is okay.</li>
            <li> and I am glad its included.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my feet and hands were</li>
            <li> I was in love.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with it rubbing off on my clothing, shaving does take off some of the color, it goes on mostly even too.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a gradual moisturizer would be better since I moisturize every night anyway.</li>
            <li> and make sure to cut the tubing of the sprayer before putting it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> or you may see some spots where there is more color deposited.  </li>
            <li> I have used way too many products and they look and smell</li>
            <li> I love the mitt, however mine got linty, I cleaned it after every use</li>
            <li> Overall the best tanner I have used and</li>
            <li> but now she uses this too and loves it. :))</li>
            <li> &gt; When applying this product, you have to make sure your spread it out immediately after you spray</li>
            <li> I am looking for something that lasts more then a day.</li>
            <li> it would work the best for future uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love</li>
            <li> I say more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was my family</li>
            <li> I was around because I would&#x27;ve been even more embarrassed if I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look like you&#x27;ve been to the bed many times.</li>
            <li> You will never get it on your hands and can rub gently on top of hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner for years and although you seem to have to re apply it daily it works great!</li>
            <li> But still looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> Guys, I seriously LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> On the way home from my vacation I made sure to tighten the lid</li>
            <li> but yet somehow it leaked again, but I placed the bottle away from clothing, but if I wouldn&#x27;t have done that I would&#x27;ve ruined more clothes.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this much better than the chemical smell of most self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried many self tan brands .</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a klutz but was able to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li> This product pleased on all levels.  </li>
            <li> and this gives me a better looking tan than the one I had 10 years ago when I faithfully went to a tanning bed all summer, and that&#x27;s after just one application.  </li>
            <li> it would look ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing better</li>
            <li> Love it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that</li>
            <li> I have used lots of self tanners and this one is okay.</li>
            <li> So glad I Purchased This.</li>
            <li> I put it on twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li> and you end up using more, but anyways.</li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> She stated that it is not her favorite bend though.</li>
            <li> but the lotion works much better.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin look so much more even.</li>
            <li> Ok just applied tonight.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re able to control the amount of tan you want on you.</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the mitt.</li>
            <li> and i love the glove applicator.</li>
            <li> WHAT YOU WANT,MAY BE ABLE TO LAYER</li>
            <li> SURE WHY PEOPLE SAID IT CAME OFF ON SHEETS,</li>
            <li> AND I TRYED SCRUBBING LIGHTER IN SHOWER TO AVOID MORE FADE,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and still love it.</li>
            <li> , you look better that way\\&quot; As furious as i was i did my research for a spray on tanner because at the tanning salons it ALWAYS makes you orange.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Instant flawless tan, no streaks!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to others &amp; they too love this product.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle because I&#x27;m in love with this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get it! :)</li>
            <li> NO nasty smell.</li>
            <li> The color is OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cotton balls, and that works better than the mitt.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE the  color for spring.</li>
            <li> ; hahaha i really am so happy i bought this stuff</li>
            <li> for up to a week or more.</li>
            <li> Either way, you will see INSTANT tanning with this awesome stuff....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product :)</li>
            <li> Which I am sure I don&#x27;t  this product turned me into a darn carrot.</li>
            <li> so I could wear a short dress to a wedding, and it was perfect!!</li>
            <li> Like, the top of my arm all the way around, then bottom of my arm, etc.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am puzzled as to why so many people like this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to bend your joints (elbows, knees, knuckles, etc.)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you will be able to see lighter lines when you bend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I like the results even better than a spray tan.</li>
            <li> Ok product</li>
            <li> Wish the glove stayed on better</li>
            <li> mit made the application very easy and it was easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I seen it with my own two eyes this stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> But what is nice about this is that you can see it right as you apply it &amp; it isn&#x27;t any kind of funky orange looking.</li>
            <li> It gives you some immediate color which is good for seeing where you are working and buffing out any lines not to mention if you are putting it on right before going out</li>
            <li> but it washes off right away and continues to wash off, making it good for the day you put it on.</li>
            <li> I use this right before bed and wake up with a gorgeous glow.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing for many reasons: it goes on incredibly even; especially if you use the mitt, it has a pleasant smell- sort of cocunuty or tropical like a nice sunscreen, and it gives an AMAZING instant tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nice scent is probably one of the thing I am most excited about, and that it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to sheets/</li>
            <li> Bake Flawless has given me a natural tan that is easy to apply, easy to maintain</li>
            <li> color isn&#x27;t as great as I would&#x27;ve wanted..or have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> it is a nice bronze, and so easy to apply and dries very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> it should be called REAL BAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this self-tanner and try it.  </li>
            <li> application is simple (even for a non-beauty nut like myself), the color is natural-looking, and the smell is very nice!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It is a nice golden brown tan!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> so I can show off my beautiful natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> So this was also a reason why I was excited because with me running my own business</li>
            <li> It is a nice golden color!</li>
            <li> Excellent product: quick, natural looking color that doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes!</li>
            <li> No mess, it dries very quickly, it has a pleasant smell, and best of all my husband loves my new glow!</li>
            <li> When you shower, the color guard comes off and leaves a nice, clean look.</li>
            <li> As long as you exfoliate good and put it on evenly then it will look great.</li>
            <li> easy, fast, and perfect golden color.</li>
            <li> First, let me say this is absolutely the best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy after application, and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> First off love this product works really good</li>
            <li> This product definitely leaves your skin with a beautiful, warm color.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product came with a mitt, also loved that it was in spray form because it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> The foam glove makes it very easy to apply in an even streak free manor.</li>
            <li> Great product, only problem is the glove needs to be bigger/longer or either more form fitting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanning products and this one is by far one of the best, at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Great way to relieve yourself of high sun exposures once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes of this being a great product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate and moisturize before using and apply to clean skin!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another comment, make sure to clean your mitt with water after every use!</li>
            <li> the mits wear quickly and i had to use a sponge paint brush to apply it afterwards, but I still love this product!</li>
            <li> Even the super pricey ones, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use often, but it&#x27;s nice for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> So I say if you want a nice glow for a special occasion, go for it.</li>
            <li> A nice light brown, did not rub off on my clothes and was easy to apply with the mitt included in the box.</li>
            <li> Great color, easy application, really lasts.</li>
            <li> I love how easily it goes on and love the color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found that using this at night is best - shower, shave, exfoliate and make sure you are completely dry.</li>

            <li> : The color guard in this product is pretty good.</li>

            <li> Besides that, it works and looks pretty good for about 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> She looked pretty good after one application.  </li>
            <li> but its pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sweet when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This product does not stain my clothes or my bedding, smells pretty good</li>
            <li> and I have pretty fair skin in winter.</li>
            <li> I can put it on my face and arms well, and it looks really pretty good.</li>
            <li> so this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good color, not orange at all</li>
            <li> The color this Tanner gives is beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Also, it keeps up pretty darn good if you are in the water.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and melanoma runs in my family</li>
            <li> and I have loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and am happy with the natural glow it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled it, it didn&#x27;t seem that strong, in fact it smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li> nice and refreshing after shower on a hot day!</li>
            <li> I get the best results by exfoliating always and using the handy little mitt that comes with.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I went to work the next day and everyone was complimenting me on how great my tan looked, I just kind of laughed to myself.</li>
            <li> Mitt: Easy, easy, easy application!</li>
            <li> so I stopped using the mitt and just started using my hand or gloves and mixed this product with Sun Lab tanning, and the results are amazing!!</li>
            <li> Lastly the smell of this product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried in a long time!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defienelt worth the buy !!</li>
            <li> So first of all i must say i absolutely love love love this product!</li>
            <li> The color is awesome and it lasts for a long while!</li>
            <li> I bought this item and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the next best thing to an airbrush tan that I have found, and much more friendly on the wallet.</li>
            <li> it only takes one application to get nice and tan!!</li>
            <li> also the new jergens self tan (smells like perfume when applying) both have been great products.</li>
            <li> Smells great, looks fantastic and really lasts a while when you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great no marks or anything :) it looks really natural on.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of my favorite self tanners, it does not turn you orange, easy application with the mitt</li>
            <li> it is easy but you may pick up a couple tips :)</li>
            <li> Its so easy to apply just make sure you spray the mit not your skin.</li>
            <li> I am super super fair skinned, and this spray turns me into a light brown tan person!</li>
            <li> I do have to do it twice to get the color I like, but just once gives a nice glow that is super wearable.</li>
            <li> It applies easily, effortlessly and smells FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> The smell could be better (smells like suntan lotion), but not as strong as some others I have used.</li>
            <li> yeah, it kind of defeated the purpose of a quick spray on tan.</li>
            <li> Very coconut-y and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> love that this stuff is easy to put on (using the mitt</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with mitt, a friend suggested this product to me and I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> No streaks, easy application, no terrible scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and really lovely results.  </li>
            <li> I love how easy it is</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the results are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong self tanner odor, like most I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as most tanners.</li>
            <li> I find that exfoliating with a loofa (while showering), then applying and wait for it to dry, then moisturizing is the best process for even color and locking it it.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner odor.</li>
            <li> The mitt makes everything blend in so easily, and if you are nervous about it, there are many videos on YouTube that show you how to apply.</li>
            <li> love the smell and color easy application.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on easily.</li>
            <li> My best advice is to exfoliate and shave well then apply it after a shower when your skin is towel dry</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to apply and that it goes on evenly&amp;#62; I just wish it got me &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great bronzer that develops immediately and honestly has me applying it daily just to have that bronzed</li>
            <li> so I mixed the spray with lotion, worked GREAT, nice even coverage.  </li>
            <li> flawless really looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different tanning products on Amazon, based on good reviews, and this one is so good.</li>
            <li> Let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Apply sunless solution as per the directions, using the gloves and the mitt, spraying on the mitt and then LIGHTLY buffing the color all over (it&#x27;s probably best to put a tiny dab of body lotion on your knees and elbows and ankles).&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and gets you really tan really fast.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about it is that it smells good.</li>
            <li> The color pay off is good with this one, just make sure you moisturize after it develops because it really drys out your skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and very natural looking!</li>
            <li> The color this produces is great (very natural).  </li>
            <li> The mitt is also very soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> Great color very natural even after just 1 use, I will but again</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m fair-skinned and it looks very natural on me)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great - coconut/tropical scent</li>
            <li> I love love love this so much I am buying more!</li>
            <li> This tanner gives a very natural tan that looks great on all skin tones.</li>
            <li> The application (for me) is flawless every single time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> Great product that looks natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands of self tanner for my legs because for some reason the rest of my body gets a beautiful tan, but my legs don&#x27;t :</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, will be ordering more, exactly as described, the color is gorgeous and it lasts  for a good&lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gives a beautiful natural glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to put on and looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> looks more natural and wears better!!  </li>
            <li> The spray goes on very smoothly and evenly, and dries almost immediately for a lightweight, light colored glow.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this item and would recommend it to anyone who needed a quick convenient tan!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly the color shows up!</li>
            <li> The best feature is it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other tanners.  </li>
            <li> , it was a deep rich brown color on me, it was perfect....</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it smells good, and it is easy to apply with the mitt.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 pumps, the liquid leaked large, brown splotches everywhere - it&#x27;s a good thing I was spraying the mitt over the sink.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy without hassle, absorbs quickly, and without steaks of any kind.</li>
            <li> Easy application, nice color (not orangey at all) and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have Irish skin, very fair with freckles</li>
            <li> Mitt that comes with it is very good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The scent is also very very good, it reminds me of vanilla mixed with coconut</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned red head.</li>
            <li> By the way I am a very fair skinned Red Head!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is the only self tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange as I am very fair.</li>
            <li> but I will only purchase again if I find it at a very good price.</li>
            <li> The color payoff is very good as well, but I would only recommend this to darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easy, blends amazingly well and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Great color, very easy to apply evenly (wash the give after each use) but color doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Worked great, loooked very natural easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on easy, dries pretty quickly, and looks great..</li>
            <li> I was able to put this on in the morning and wear it all day and wasn&#x27;t bothered at all by the fragrance which is a HUGE deal for me.</li>
            <li> glad this available.  </li>
            <li> It came way before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Since I cannot tan naturally, and I also don&#x27;t want the harmful effects of tanning, I am always looking for a great self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Love this...easy to apply looks good and more like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful almost instant beach glow I get!</li>
            <li> It was a perfect transaction and it arrived just as expected.</li>
            <li> I use this one on my face too, I spray a light amount on a foundation spounge and rub it on in circular motions making sure I get my hair line and under my chin evenly.</li>
            <li> &amp; i also use tanning face cloths by another brand for my face, i don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on face even though it says its okay.</li>
            <li> The mitt isnt the best for applying either as the fluff of the mitt comes off on your skin.</li>
            <li> Gives a great, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t let the color sink in at all, so it&#x27;s better to not put anything and just lightly pass the mitt over these areas.</li>
            <li> And most importantly you can control the amount of tan you want.</li>
            <li> Great, natural color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how the fake bake looks on my skin, and when i tried the flawless finish i was happy with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice vanilla beach scent and you can tell that the mitt that comes along with this product is made of  higher quality than most.</li>
            <li> I will be using the product again this Friday and probably once a week throughout summer and into fall as it makes me feel much more comfortable in sleeveless tanks or shorts.</li>
            <li> Goes on SO smooth &amp; so much easier than any kind of lotion!</li>
            <li> Gives a great, natural tan</li>
            <li> The most important thing is to shave, exfoliate and do not leave any moisturizer on your skin unless you DON&amp;#34;T want the color to stay.  </li>
            <li> Great product looks really natural</li>
            <li> The mitt works great and goes on even and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, which is not something you can say about many self-tanners.</li>
            <li> The price was dirt cheap, however, Im glad I went ahead and gave it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great natural look.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions of going lightly over knees and ankles, making sure they were extended</li>
            <li> People are always saying &amp;#34; wow do you have a great tan&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> I found spraying the mitt then applying gave me beautiful complete smooth coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> But be sure to just snip about a inch off it so it will fit in the bottle smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is relatively cheap and love that it comes with a mitt.</li>
            <li> the mit offers a great application</li>
            <li> After a week, I had a great natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> and I wished the color could have been darker, but it was fairly natural and not streaky, so I am happy with that.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever spent my money on.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great product with a natural color</li>
            <li> Great natural bronzed look without streaking.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I feel like this was more than worth my money, and if you want it to work, you have to be patient and do what it recommends in the directions for the best result!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I used to airbrush but the place near me moved</li>
            <li> To me the most important characteristics of a sunless tanner is smell, color, and ease of application.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great non streaking and natural looking spray tan just stop here, you found it.  </li>
            <li> The best of times with those products even with the utmost careful application was always given away by ONE DAMN SPOT.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no streaking at all with this product which is wonderful considering</li>
            <li> Probably great for unblemished skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on my skin smoothly and is safe on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> She always has such a beautiful and healthy looking glow to her skin, so I immediately did my investigating on Amazon.</li>
            <li> NICE LIGHT SWEET SMELL&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure to exfoliate, then shave and of course, lotion up with something light.  </li>
            <li> Put it on the night before my college graduation and turned my body a nice golden tan, instead of a smelly carrot.  </li>
            <li> I had a nice golden tan ....</li>
            <li> Good for a days use when you wont sweat much.</li>
            <li> I do believe that people&#x27;s skin PH has to do with tanning results, but honestly it is soo worth the try.</li>
            <li> REALLY good advice because the mitt absorbs too much for legs, for example.  </li>
            <li> Delivers a nice golden brown color immediately.  </li>
            <li> I just reordered and used it, and it was good, but I did not notice much color this time.  </li>
            <li> The mitt it comes with is GREAT - it really helps smooth the product on evenly - no streaks or runs, just smooth application.</li>
            <li> WOW loved this product, nothing close to orange, perfect balance, the tan develops to MATCH your individual skin tone, and my problem area had always been around my ankles and face.</li>
            <li> it smells good and drys fast  </li>
            <li> * If you like having a guide color this is a good one as it doesn&#x27;t transfer too much.</li>
            <li> and you have a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> and it gave me a nice golden brown colour.</li>
            <li> Gives nice golden color, not orange.</li>
            <li> couldnt really get how to make this look good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice golden brown, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> It smells SO good - very tropical.</li>
            <li> I loved my tan so much.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and smells really good for a self tanner.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and looks real.</li>
            <li> and then my skin starts to peel and the tan goes away, so I NEVER get a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a nice golden brown color.</li>
            <li> Good price – very affordable&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little darker, but this color guard is beautiful and great for adding quick color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY self-tanners and this is hands down, the best!</li>
            <li> This product is very cost effective, dries very quickly, and smells better than most tanning products.</li>
            <li> The price is right too!!</li>
            <li> The color looks great, and while it may stain clothes the first day, it comes right out when you wash it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> I have used many self less tanning products and always an orange hugh, but this is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Great product and super fast arrival.</li>
            <li> I used it during the wintertime (I live in North Idaho) and people were baffled and jealous of my tan :p</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and the price was right.</li>
            <li> the color looked amazing on my body right away</li>
            <li> have found if I use it after a shower right before I go out it does give me a nice tan look, I just have to reapply each time I go out.</li>
            <li> Color is good, I found two days in a row and my white body was the best, three got a little blotchy around wrist and ankles no matter how good my application was.</li>
            <li> it goes on easy and instant color perfect for a night out or quick tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply evenly, the color is natural looking and the smell is pleasant, unlike most sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> This gives me a nice light sun kissed look with no hassle and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The application was the only thing I loved about this (LOVE the mitt!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, the glove , fast shipping....everything but that spray bottle top!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li> The best thing about fake bake flawless is that it dries very, very fast.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice natural brown color and a color guide that allows you to see where you have tanned.</li>
            <li> Not only did it give me a gorgeous golden brown tan, but it is also extremely easy to use, very lightweight, and smells great!  </li>
            <li> I like the original formula much better.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The mitt makes it super easy to apply and with no streaks!</li>
            <li> I even love the smell, and it is fun putting it on!</li>
            <li> Super easy!  </li>
            <li> other than that, its awesome!</li>
            <li> so when I saw this one I was excited so many reviews.</li>
            <li> But If you cleanse properly you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> Other than leaving pore marks its great!</li>
            <li> First of all, how can you ask for a better price on a self tanner!?</li>
            <li> Original seems to be more of a once-a-week application as it is darker and thicker.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is true!  </li>
            <li> but I really truely suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li> First off, I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Almost finished with my first bottle :) Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> But overall really good!</li>
            <li> I was complemented several time on how good my tan looked!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product from all the other name there is in the market.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the package and recommendations of other reviewers: exfoliation, blending balm, gloves &amp; mit (they come with FakeBake Flawless), and I use Malibu Hemp Firming Lotion with gradual tanner in it- daily(Walmart).</li>
            <li> Super easy to use just spray and rub and done!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange, like other products do.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the original FB &amp; figured this would be better which it is.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is great!</li>
            <li> I have used other products of this nature and found this to be the best.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that i love this product!</li>
            <li> It actually smells good!  </li>
            <li> All in all the products beats being a slave to the (killer) tanning beds but requires more at home maintenance than I originally thought it would</li>

            <li> the the perfume smell is so strong im getting nauseous.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong coconut smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, but it looks really natural :)</li>
            <li> the smell is not as strong as others</li>
            <li> A STRONG SOWER GEL/SOAP  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, the aroma is pleasant, it dries quickly and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> &amp; This particular seller (123 Skincare) has the most outstanding customer service I have ever had the pleasure of being served!</li>
            <li> When I applied this product I noticed it had a very nice smell, unlike many other self tanners and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok, because I have a special bed sheet that protects my mattress but FYI to those that dont.</li>
            <li> The tanning spray smells good but not strong at all which is great.</li>
            <li> Loved this product when I first received and used it, but it fades way to quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good results, quick dry, no fuss, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> , To my surprise it was all I ever wanted and more, the smell is very mild and has a sort of tropical smell to it but not overpowering, I love the spray, I just have to work fast and rub from top to bottom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and several of my friends are already ordering it because they really liked the look.</li>
            <li> It looked amazing at first.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product smells amazingly tropical.</li>
            <li> It already has amazing reviews and after my first use I see why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and definitely not the most skilled person out there at applying tanners.</li>
            <li> but this stuff (with just one application every couple of days) gives me a good normal looking skin tone.</li>
            <li> first I put on lotion on my face then 3 Sparys of the tanner it gives my body a nice glow and smells like coconuts yummy</li>
            <li> but you are still left with beautiful color.  </li>
            <li> and Sat I applied the tanner, took a shower the next day and by Sunday I had a beautiful all-over bronze.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of any kind of tanner including the sun.</li>
            <li> No big deal, I just repeated the process, and was beautifully tan again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I applied the product by myself and was able to reach most areas, but you may want to have a friend or loved one help you do your back if you plan on wearing something that exposes it.</li>
            <li> With only one application that ended up lasting a good week this gave the perfect color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had beautiful, even, color all over my body within ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I used this and although the color came out nice at first...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and some of the tips from others and got a nice, even color with the first application.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it fades pretty nicely and lasted me about 8-10 days.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and actually smells really good!  </li>
            <li> this gave me a flawless dark glow to start the summer off with.</li>
            <li> Stuff works pretty damn good, and doesn&#x27;t make me orange, just make sure you scrape off your skin first</li>
            <li> The glove makes for perfect coverage, no creases or dark spots.</li>
            <li> , I can build up a pretty nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Followed directions for application, went on beautifully, washed off in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li> After experimenting and so much research about the perfect tan I can across fake bake flawless and million dollar tan icon.</li>
            <li> When I apply the tanner, I get an instant, beautiful colored tan.</li>
            <li> Perfect dark tan.</li>
            <li> smell is fine, its not too strong or too bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and actually looks like a tan.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but since this was a beauty product and I am all about sharing with anyone who will listen about good products...</li>
            <li> (not bad but is overwhelming).</li>
            <li> Just run it under water and the tanner comes right out very easily.  </li>
            <li> Sellers were very easy right work with.</li>
            <li> I liked the Fake Bake Flawless because it gives a beautiful, realistic tan glow.</li>
            <li> Unlike most self tanners, this tanner gives you a nice realistic tan.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes on clean, smells great, absorbs well, and looks natural.</li>

            <li> The mit is pure genius!!!</li>
            <li> However, it was very easy to apply and see where it was, and has a pleasant scent to it (unlike many other self-tanners).  </li>
            <li> the that the color turns out fine for me</li>
            <li> ; My arms look fine, but legs not so much.(did exfoliate)</li>
            <li> It does come off onto light colored clothing, but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I allowed the color to sit for a couple hours before going to bed, but it still stained my bedsheets; it washed out fine, but I&#x27;d suggest putting something over your sheets just in case.   </li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> easy application, streak free results, never buying anything else for tanning again.</li>
            <li> i look like a gay fish</li>
            <li> It is a pain to do, but otherwise the tanner dries and hardens the mitten and the application isn&#x27;t as easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> but my oils work fine.)</li>
            <li> but my oils work fine.)</li>
            <li> The colour is fantastic and the product dries easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply but the color payoff was so light</li>
            <li> everything has washed up fine.</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t look orange, but you need to make sure your skin is clean and you&#x27;re freshly shaven</li>
            <li> The color lasts for a couple days but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li> The mit makes things really smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> This one smells fine, but every time I used it I turned orange, NOT brown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write many reviews, but this product is deserving.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Unscented would be just fine with me.  </li>
            <li> so i just got a darker makeup and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> I reapply about twice a week, and it takes so much less time than driving to a tanning salon :D  </li>
            <li> This is a light smell that is easily masked if you want to tan in the morning instead of night.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and would rate this higher than most.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The whole-body application process takes me less than 10 minutes, and I always end up with flawless results.</li>
            <li> the non aerosol spray is easy to use, it has a nice tropical scent, a gorgeous, believable color, quick dry time, and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, sheets, etc.</li>
            <li> the smell is fine.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> and packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> Natural color, easy to apply, dries quick and smells great.</li>
            <li> I used the product last night for the first time and it was effortless and the results are truly flawless.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and easy.  </li>
            <li> but it comes out just fine after going through the wash</li>
            <li> The mitt works fine, and I wash it out thoroughly in between uses.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best self tanner I have ever tried, and I normally dont like them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> And it smells super tropical which I love.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut smell and how quickly the product absorbs.</li>
            <li> drys quickly,  and truly no streaking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really pleased with how quickly I can apply this product.</li>
            <li> quickly I rec&#x27;d my stuff!</li>
            <li> I love that it bronzes your skin as you apply, so you can see where its going and quickly even out the color to avoid streaks and blotches.</li>
            <li> So it works, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemistry set as most seem to and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Has a strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It is super to apply no steaks and doesn&#x27;t rub or melt off!</li>
            <li> I also love that it dries so quickly, so none of the product gets on clothes or on your sheets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Tan Towels, Quick drench,Banana Boat,L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze,and Neutrogena Sunless tan products.</li>
            <li> I use this product mostly on my face/neck area because those are the areas that fade quickly on my body.</li>
            <li> Then on it goes (it dries quickly too!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends who use it loyally now as well.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this tanner (besides the super yummy smell) is the dying time.</li>
            <li> This product is super legit!</li>
            <li> Love the color of this product and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The color on my face fades much more quickly than it does on my body though.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it dries and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; like the others often do.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly on your skin but still has a tanning lotion smell but its not terrible.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose my tan!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Pleasant smell – no harsh chemical smell</li>
            <li> I did like it, but thought this product might be better since it dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be ok now, you just have to spray and rub the product in quick (or find whatever works for your body/skin).</li>
            <li> And I got it so quick with Amazon!</li>
            <li> The mousse is more of a quick, on-the-go product.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and very natural looking...</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best self tanner available.</li>
            <li> For reference I have an odd combination of skin traits I am very fair because I spend most days inside</li>
            <li> Great color that look very natural and pretty!</li>
            <li> There is an abundant amount of positive costumer feedback about this product so I am hoping it was just a defective bottle.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smells nice, came quickly, gave nice natural color.</li>
            <li> Creates a gorgeous all-over body tan that looks natural and not orange!</li>
            <li> It even looks good on my feet, and that to me, is the hardest area to make look natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, gently exfoliating twice a week and putting more product on, and it looks just as good as the first time.</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as anything used in a professional tanning salon!</li>
            <li> You absolutely need to wear the gloves and get more from amazon, you&#x27;ll need them!</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and natural!</li>
            <li> Love it and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It makes me skin look very tan and healthy!</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite to date!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, gives you a nice color right away, dries lightning fast, didn&#x27;t transfer onto any of my clothes or sheets, isn&#x27;t ORANGE.</li>
            <li> The only sunless tanner I ever used before this was Jergen&#x27;s gradual tanning lotion (which doesn&#x27;t smell great and gets streaky easily).</li>
            <li> Easy, fast, nice color that lasts about a week for me.</li>
            <li> It only takes a minute and it will make each time you use it a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a pleasant smell while applying, but that I don&#x27;t smell like the faux tan later.</li>
            <li> great for a last minute &#x27;tan&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, easy</li>
            <li> I get a nice golden glow quickly and evenly in no time.  </li>
            <li> nice smell, easy application, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really is the most reliable self-tanner out there, so if you&#x27;re new or or nervous or just looking for a great deal, you have my recommendation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin has a nice golden glow!</li>
            <li> I just purchased their Flawless Dark, excited to see how that product turns out as well.</li>
            <li> No need for fancy scrubs, use a cheap one and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy with the mitt, works instantly, doesn&#x27;t streak, looks 100% real, gives impressive results with one application, and smells like a freaking island paradise.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel white and in need of some glow, this is perfect and puts on really fast and easy.</li>
            <li> but if you have somewhat of a light tan or any hint of being in the sun, you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is VERY fair skinned that it looks a little orange if she is in a hurry, but over all I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Had a very strong bronzer, I looked orange for hours after application, but was willing to deal with it.</li>
            <li> All I can say wow what a good color tan not Oregon at all just a good tan color,  and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Other than that, product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Always make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li> A little too perfect of a tan.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the application mitt and how much easier it makes the tanning process!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, and works amazing first time buying this</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned naturally, and I am cautious about how much sun exposure I get because there is a history of melanoma in my family.</li>
            <li> I am VERY satisfied with this product so far!!</li>
            <li> Best part from having a quick, streakfree tan, is that when it wears off, it doesn&#x27;t leave you blotchy like other spray tan methods do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best self tanner available hands down!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very new to this product, but I really do love it!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> It was very fast and easy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak..</li>
            <li> Which was a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li> I like the mitt that comes with it because it makes applying the spray easier and blends it in nicely for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliated when I showered at night, and then took one more shower in the morning, scrubbed the rough spots to even things out a bit, came out looking great :</li>
            <li> was the most amazing, natural bronze tan.</li>
            <li> but it was a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li> and that is a huge pet peeve of mine with FakeBake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> description was accurate arrived promptly through amazon shipping</li>
            <li> this is by far the best tanning spray you will ever use aloge with xen tan blending balm looks like a natural tan without the damage of the sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak..</li>
            <li> but they can be a huge pain to apply.</li>
            <li> Then after some research this is what I found, and after I followed it it was a HUGE HUGE sigh of relief.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this tanner and haven&#x27;t broke out at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This by far is the most amazing self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best self-tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used --- You have complete control over where it goes</li>
            <li> so I make a huge effort to stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> it fades smoothly and not in blotches.</li>
            <li> I have light gray sheets</li>
            <li> It will be nice to have a tan in the winter when I can&#x27;t get out so much.</li>
            <li> The color guide is a nice bronze, but when it washes off, the whole tan seems to go with it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and looks immediately tan.</li>
            <li> So silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using a light hand when applying</li>
            <li> I feel like if you enjoy liquid tanners, you will enjoy this</li>
            <li> Streak free.</li>
            <li> So I used it for 3 days on my legs and upper arms and it looked great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self-tanner products and this one is probably the best one yet.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use light circles</li>
            <li> Then I observed my hairdresser with a lovely golden glow.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great self tanner.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin.  </li>
            <li> Goes on really well and leaves a nice color.</li>
            <li> Color was great and instant!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times, and it is the best!</li>
            <li> It is not, however, fool proof - I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and yet found some streaky places and grubbiness on the knees, but as I applied it in the wee hours in not-the-brightest light, I will chalk that up to user error.</li>
            <li> The kit does it&#x27;s job and makes things streak free.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I forbid tanning beds even though she works at a gym and gets free use.  </li>
            <li> I did not even scrub my skin, I rinsed it lightly with baby wash.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and streak free.</li>
            <li> It soaks into the mitt, so most of the tanner is absorbed into the mitt, not on your skin.</li>
            <li> A coworker who owns her own tanning bed was absolutely gobsmacked to find out I was using a self-tanner and not visiting a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I was hooked - now a dozen or so boxes later, I&#x27;m still just as happy.  </li>
            <li> I started using the plastic disposable latex gloves (box of 100 is so cheap).  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and it applies light brown so you can see if you&#x27;ve missed any spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this looks, especially considering the price!  </li>
            <li> It gives a fantastic color.</li>
            <li> The stuff gives you a great looking tan which last for days.  </li>
            <li> I only used it on my legs and it looks great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use in the winter time, but not enough color for the summer.  </li>
            <li> Wore my shorts the next day and felt and looked great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how fabulous this product went on.</li>
            <li> B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]] has been by far the best of the bunch I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> reference, I&#x27;m of Southeastern descent with naturally light medium beige skin.</li>
            <li> Also it is important to shave and exfoliate before use.</li>
            <li> also really enjoy the color.</li>
            <li> My skin never sees the light of day without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> streak free, and covers well, with natural&lt;br /&gt;cover and color, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried light spray tans, tanning lotions, pills you name it.</li>
            <li> are this cheap and 4.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it stays fantastic as the hours go by.</li>
            <li> Not with this product though - I like how smooth and even my chests</li>
            <li> Worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> but from there on its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Light eyes and light hair...</li>
            <li> does show on the sheets if they are light when you apply at bedtime</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly with the mitt and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> I applied it a few times for a week and was not too impressed.</li>
            <li> Honestly did not expect to like this tanner as much as I do...</li>
            <li> :) Normally I don&#x27;t go for bronzers, but in this case it is a beautiful, light brown, somewhat translucent and natural looking shade</li>
            <li> I do one light spray on to the mitt, and apply it where the sun would darken my face.</li>
            <li> In the morning I shower, rubbing my skin with just my hand, and do any light touch ups I might need.</li>
            <li> mitt is fantastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several faux tan products, not being happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li> great instant tan.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this came as a surprise because their tan looked genuine.</li>
            <li> that this comes with a mit for free</li>
            <li> It does take more work to buff into the skin compared to a mouses but the color it leaves is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous....</li>
            <li> When I saw the material of the Baiden mitten, I knew that the Korean Italy cloths that I had grown up with would do the trick every bit as well, but for a fraction of the cost (you can buy them in any Korean market, or buy one on eBay for $1.15 + free shipping, versus paying $50 for the Baiden mitten).</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly without leaving you orange.</li>
            <li> I am so silky smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li> another important step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the price is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I have a light to med olive  complexion and when I tan in the beach</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and you can see immediately where the color is.</li>
            <li> Only one application and my legs looked great.</li>
            <li> It was always splotchy in the sunlight, and filled in my pores.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t show lines.</li>
            <li> i think i used it 3 days in a row and then maintain it with a cheap gradual lotion tanner once a day from Ulta.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on and LIGHTLY spread the spray with the application pad.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my face.  </li>
            <li> This color is not orange at all, but more so GOLDEN BROWN.</li>
            <li> mid week with the lotion is a great combination.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend showering, shaving, exfoliating and lightly moisturing before using this product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too much and the color is nice... not orange.  </li>
            <li> You spray the product onto the mitt and apply to your skin using circular motion to avoid streaking and making sure it&#x27;s absorbed onto the skin evenly.  </li>
            <li> A horrid color for someone with naturally light skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to lightly go over your hands and feet and bend your arms</li>
            <li> Smooth application</li>
            <li> like I do..go lightly with the product.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly without streaking or looking blotchy,&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li> many products have that distinct self-tanner smell that you want to wash off as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> That is always a concern for me if I am wearing light color clothes in the summer.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very well.  </li>
            <li> 5 minutes later she bought it lol.</li>
            <li> great for a last minute event that you want to look bronze for overnight!</li>
            <li> It may sound like there isn&#x27;t a lot in the (smallest) bottle</li>
            <li> It would be great if you don&#x27;t like actually going into the pool and just wanna sit on the side...</li>
            <li> Really natural color, love love love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that even though it smells great (coconut)</li>
            <li> I does a terrific job and the color is great.  </li>
            <li> Scent is fantastic, but not overpowering&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I then jump in the shower and lightly wash it off.  </li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it as I apply it, but it still applies smoothly and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use if you just want some color for an event, but if you are looking for something to maintain color over time, you would have to reapply this one almost daily.</li>
            <li> This went on extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t make me look orange at all.</li>
            <li> I have been trying many many tan products for my upcoming wedding and this one gives the most natural color.</li>
            <li> Overall great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It applies so even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Stained everything light</li>
            <li> &amp; I may be spraying too lightly each time onto the mitt</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to lightly buff the product on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding this edit to emphasize how important it is to wash your mitten between uses.</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;ll see how it works on paler skin because with banana boat i had boughten it last summer and it looked great over an already tan body but</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; evenly.</li>
            <li> works well, color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> or if you just want a light coverage.</li>
            <li> Why it wasn&#x27;t available in the US, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was left with great color.  </li>
            <li> I have my roommate do my back and the back of my shoulders and legs just to make sure it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
            <li> It was a cheap immitation of a liquid/spray tanning solution.</li>
            <li> you can try to get a light sun tan.</li>
            <li> Followed someone&#x27;s advice; by using scrubbing gloves during shower, then applying to the mitt and rubbing lightly on skin.  </li>
            <li> Great color payoff after second application.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT  and WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> but i did on my hands since it was not going on smoothly and</li>
            <li> I watched a few Youtube videos on how to get the best coverage and application.  </li>
            <li> Great for the sudden need of a tan.</li>
            <li> and to keep it in one place &amp; easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> and i dont mind reapplying everyday because it smells great!</li>
            <li> The overall idea of this product is great.  </li>
            <li> This product smells great and gives instant bronzers so you can literally apply it and then walk out the door.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond fabulous.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic to use for an event, night out, wedding, etc.</li>
            <li> I took my gloves off and lightly went over my hands.</li>
            <li> Goes on streak free</li>
            <li> It actually works, looks great with no streaking.</li>
            <li> I went to bed and slept comfortably throughout the night and in the morning there were no stains on my sheets.</li>
            <li> and I was left with a great tan and no smell</li>
            <li> This selftanner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The end result is great, until 2-3 days later.</li>
            <li> This product was really great especially in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I was so smooth but</li>
            <li> i used the spray nasal after trimming the tube to fit the bottle.</li>
            <li> in the morning i washed my face with a gentle cleanser in the shower and the color looked amazing and did not make my acne scars stand out the way it did the night before.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin tone</li>
            <li> Im applying lightly twice a week to maintain and using Jergans gradual tan lotion in light on the off days.</li>
            <li> The color-guiding bronzer does not wash off in the shower if you do a light rinse/wash.</li>
            <li> Great tanner, red undertones, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> , the mitt is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but  not as smooth as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I recommend just NOT using it on your elbows or knees, or just EVER so stinking lightly.</li>
            <li> take your time and do it with plenty of advanced notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few sunless tanners and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not orange looking and smells fantastic...</li>
            <li> People keep asking me where I have been to get such a great looking tan.</li>
            <li> And the mitt is cheap.</li>
            <li> It was virtually streak free.</li>
            <li> Both could have fit in the package together and saved on postage.  </li>
            <li> Its do fast and looks amazing every time.</li>
            <li> You just start out with light layers and continue layering until you get the shade you want.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Look Orange ( Looked More Like A Golden Tan But Not Orange )</li>
            <li> I am a light olive skin colour</li>
            <li> Some brown colour can be seen in the water that rinses off in the shower but you are still left with a great colour.</li>
            <li> Once out of the shower I toweled off thoroughly and put moisturizer on my face, hands, lightly on my knees, elbows, and feet.</li>
            <li> and I find it extremely important that it looks &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The color guard is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you have light skin and you want a glow, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It goes on very evenly, it smells nice, and it doesn&#x27;t look orange.</li>
            <li> It smells tropical and goes on streak free.</li>
            <li> There is SOME light streaking as it does take time to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> 6- spray onto glove and lightly apply to face.&lt;br /&gt;step</li>
            <li> looks great the next day</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless is by far the best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my skin sticky, and I can see instant results!</li>
            <li> If it was available in a spray mist it would be easier to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> all of the bronzer washed off and left me with a great looking</li>
            <li> Couple light smudges around my toe</li>
            <li> AND it has enough color to be a great guide for where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent going on, but I did get that gross after scent.  </li>
            <li> I am light skinned.</li>
            <li> The mitt helps the product go on smoothly and evenly without staining your hands.  </li>
            <li> I got this product a few weeks ago and it works great!</li>
            <li> It fades nicely like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Great tanning product, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It works for some,and doesn&#x60;t for others.&lt;br /&gt;The success of using depends on so many factors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> try it when you have the time, and when you do not have any important appearances;&lt;br /&gt;-try</li>
            <li> a day before and do not use creams or body lotions before( except a light layer on palms,knees,elbows;&lt;br /&gt;-DON&#x60;T USE THE GIVEN MITT, purchase a separate one from Beautisol</li>
            <li> or just use apricot scrub on the cheap.</li>
            <li> but that is important</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliation and barrier creams are important.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth.</li>
            <li> Apply a light moisturizer to elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mit is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It will wash away after you wash your hands or take a shower, but your tan will still be there lightly.</li>
            <li> wish it  had a  more golden golw.</li>
            <li> Great for instant color.</li>
            <li> The smell is very tropical and smells like coconut rum to be honest in the bottle.</li>
            <li> it helps give a streak free look.</li>
            <li> The price is great especially for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different self tan products, and this by far is the BEST I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> Color goes on smooth and looks &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The mitt applications makes for the even smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> This product goes on so evenly and smooth, you don&#x27;t have to keep washing your hands in fear of staining them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay upwards of $50 for some of the ones you might find at a cosmetics counter that get fantastic reviews.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, smells nice.</li>
            <li> but overall it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I use light therapy for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products and haven&#x27;t come across any that have actually been streak free or good smelling.</li>
            <li> Enjoy a tan without worry of skin cancer</li>
            <li> Streak free.</li>
            <li> but what a great and crucial piece to avoid orange spots and hand stains.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;The color is good, natural looking shade not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> and I also loved how you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s far superior to Jergens, et al.</li>
            <li> I can now feel much more confident knowing I&#x27;m not aging my skin in trying to get a real tan.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> love it, make skin soft and give it nice shade of tan.</li>
            <li> Perfect plenty to do whole body several times</li>
            <li> and so far it looks good.</li>
            <li> Flawless mitt helps for a smooth application, although I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much of it is wasted by soaking into the mitt itself.  </li>
            <li> Really it stays on best if you just wash with soap only &amp; no cloth or scrubber.  </li>
            <li> Literally everyone I&#x27;ve seen who has had a gorgeous tan admitted to using Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> and the mitt kept absorbing more and more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fair with reddish undertone and I have tried so many different self tanners.</li>
            <li> Being able to see where you put it and having instant gorgeous...</li>
            <li> I took another reviewers advice and wash the mitt out after every use; so far so good.</li>
            <li> With this it looks perfectly natural and makes me look good</li>
            <li> gives a good natural tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the best or as good as St Tropez mousse faux tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how good this works.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I am 21 years old and extremely fair.</li>
            <li> It is good for anyone, of any color as far as I am can tell.</li>
            <li> The color is a good natural one.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am a fair, blond, blue eyed woman with the whitest legs you have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> So being 31 years old, I know that tanning isn&#x27;t good for me...</li>
            <li> This product is really good and leaves your skin naturally tan and for its price</li>
            <li> This product is good enough for me to recommend to my sister, since we both understand the damaging effects of the sun, but desire a believable looking tan.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, no harsh tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> My natural color is fair to medium.</li>
            <li> I spray the product directly onto my skin (instead of onto the mitt), which I find to be more effective, but it gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> The tan looks really good, and natural.</li>
            <li> It delivered a natural looking glow that I loved it and for once I didn&#x27;t stink like self tanner.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> the color isn&#x27;t orange, but really natural even on lighter or fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> Natural looking, not orange (and I&#x27;m fair skinned).</li>
            <li> I ordered Fake Bake Flawless after a friend of mine recommended it to someone on Facebook after the girl asked if anyone knew where to get a good spray tan that didn&#x27;t turn you orange.</li>
            <li> Bake Flawless is now my favorite product.o knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly, let it sit for at LEAST 6 hours, and use your hands to rinse, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also smells really good and makes your skin soft after application.</li>
            <li> Although the color is good when you put it on, it seems to wash off almost completely.</li>
            <li> The product was in perfect condition and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> VERY natural looking!!!!!</li>
            <li> So excited I can do quick touch ups and color my legs when I need to!</li>
            <li> Again, with the bronzer it looks like I have a great and natural tan, however if this application does not darken I wonder if it will wash right off tonight when I shower.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale so this is perfect!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve always had pale skin, but this tanner gives me that perfect bronze glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ghostly pale and this is the perfect medium bronze for me!</li>
            <li> this has a nice natural color, if you have fair skin do  NOT use too often youll be bronze like SNOOOOKIII but other wise</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the mitt and the application; but after the first time I used this and saw how easy it was to apply, I was hopeful.  </li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING absolutely no icky self tanner smell that sticks with you all day!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants that flawless, fresh tan !</li>
            <li> , interesting right?</li>
            <li> I love that you can see the color right away.</li>
            <li> I got 2 more boxes of this tanning product waiting to be bought in my cart right now,</li>
            <li> All the reviews were right, and I am so glad I took a chance on this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better than it is right now.</li>
            <li> I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied it right &amp;</li>
            <li> i do love how it gives you a tan right away and  gradually builds darker.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;d do anything with water right after your application (like washing your face, brushing your teeth, etc).</li>
            <li> I watched many videos on how to apply it and it work right for me.</li>
            <li> YouTube had great demo on this product so it made it very easy to apply and get a great tan look with only few minutes before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and all of the other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and can not expose myself to sun or tanning beds due to battling melanoma twice.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, I would recommend THIS over the original as its easier to apply &amp;better outcome.its worth a try if you have the $.</li>
            <li> Love this product, doesnt leave streaks, smells great unlike other self tanners</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is better than any other tanning product I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> The color is NOT dark but is also not orange,  a good light bronze color.</li>
            <li> This one has NO bad smell, and it goes on easily with the applicator mitt.</li>
            <li> I do not go to the tanning bed, so this product is exactly what I need!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li> Instant tan, love it!!</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty steamed!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use it a lot, I recommend exfoliating really well each time you use this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li> FEEL PRETTY!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big production to put it on all over evenly, but the results are very nice.</li>
            <li> It comes out a beautiful light brown color that you can build on and it stays a far more natural shade than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and had my teenage daughter wanting to use it!</li>
            <li> Even if you get extra product in one spot it evens out very nicely after you shower.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon reimbursed me but the product itself is okay if you want a quick tan look</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and lasts on my skin longer than most people said it would.</li>
            <li> It has a great color at first, much better color then others that I&#x27;ve tried, but once I showered the next day all the color was gone.</li>
            <li> The price is incredible, compared to tanning memberships and other tanning</li>
            <li> Ever since then I have searched high and low for the perfect self tanner...</li>
            <li> I am SUPER fair skinned and this product looked completely natural on me!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve got my mother in law &amp; all my girls in love with this stuff , it really is a quick easy way to get quick color , not a nasty orange color either , a nice deep tan .</li>
            <li> You can always build on it either right after ur first application or the next day it still looks great!</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy, smells great, dries fast, and fades natural...</li>
            <li> Easy apply looks much more natural than most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the spray top because it goes everywhere around in a fine mist, I noticed it on the bathroom floor later, so I just unscrew the top and dap on the mitt and apply in circular motion, works much better for me that way.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I watched youtube videos on how to apply and it was super easy.</li>
            <li> I applied lightly the first time to make sure that it didn&#x27;t appear orange or out of the bottle tan.</li>

            <li> I found this product to be super easy to apply with the mitt.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that using this stuff gives me a decent tan that by no means looks orange.</li>
            <li> Goes on super easy</li>
            <li> The smell is very delightful at first whiff but after being on the skin for more than an hour it starts to have a very odd and displeasing smell.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The guide makes it easy to get the tan even, and it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> Plus if it does stain, it also washes out super easily.</li>
            <li> If you exfoliate first as the instructions say-it really looks good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super easy to blend</li>
            <li> Also easy to quickly build a gradual tan.</li>
            <li> They made it super easy.</li>

            <li> Goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>

            <li> Super easy to apply too.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to put on and it doesn&#x27;t leave an orange or streaky look.</li>
            <li> It drys really quick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply, using the mix that comes with the spray.  </li>
            <li> This product is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to use</li>

            <li> love the mitt and smell is great compared to other self tanners!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer to apply than say a lotion and it will end up on your light-colored clothing, but it washes out and it really does give you a rich, brown tan for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Found my new favorite sunless tanner!</li>
            <li> This is now my new favorite!</li>
            <li> live in Texas and most know that with the sun here, I should be able to tan without problem.</li>
            <li> I like to use it in the morning because the color guard gives you an awesome, dark tan right away</li>
            <li> Also, this seller shipped it super fast which is always nice.</li>
            <li> It works great for a quick and simple tan!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and it really was easy to apply, and I didnt get all of that yucky orange streaking on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It was easy, it smells good when you put it on, I wore the gloves, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t when he did my back</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply, never looks orange, never streaks and always looks natural --- and I am a spaz with this kind of stuff.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very well and is nice for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, natural looking color, nice smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the mitten, however you must take your time and really make sure you apply it correctly and stay away from water, sweat, or the rain.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gives a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> so I have to put a crappy towel down to prevent it getting on my floors or spray my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> Wow, I just used this for the first time and love it!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it smells great and goes on looking very natural.</li>
            <li> Used to use fake bake mousse and loved it, but this is even better because the tan really lasts --  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you exfoliate very well!</li>
            <li> But so worth it!  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t apply for me as well as the cream original formula.</li>
            <li> I think this product was worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also significantly easier than lotion to rub into the skin without streaks.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure I rinse my mitt with hot water immediately after using</li>
            <li> I am so excited to find this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m golden yaaay!</li>
            <li> I had to stop when I became more aware of the consequences of sun overexposure.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> And I just poked a small hole in the seal to stick the tube of the spray nozzle into and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> rolled around that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it for me...however!  </li>
            <li> , I burn, so I was excited to try this</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is my all time favorite self tanner!</li>
            <li> and after just one use of this i am golden , glowing and not orange !</li>
            <li> I love this,but after my first apply,  found out Im allergic to it.</li>
            <li> She was really excited about the results</li>
            <li> oh, I was so excited to use,</li>
            <li> Ive got my 3rd bottle still loving it!</li>
            <li> Not orange, no streaks , no weird smell, and love the applying mit.</li>
            <li> Just as good as a spray tan actually much much better, looks more natural, cheaper, lasts just as long&amp; my favorite -that one ingredient that all tanning products have</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product after reading all of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product and try it out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited,</li>
            <li> The product came and i was sooo excited to use it</li>
            <li> I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> all tan wipes I&#x27;m used to using but def worth the time!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past,and I can &#x27;t believe Amazon can offer this product for almost 1/2 the price I originally paid.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the color &amp; application the first time I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine any of the higher priced sunless tanning lotions doing any better.</li>
            <li> in fact I bought the original and the darker version because I couldn&#x27;t decide.</li>
            <li> the original took about 2-3ish coats.</li>
            <li> No horrible smell, funny orange color or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to found this</li>
            <li> It has great staying power, but not as long as some of the pricier ones</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time this week and love it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> When the correct measures are taken, it looks great for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> and I was definately not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> I feel HOT with the color it gives me :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past alone with out a spray tan underneath and it truly is &#x27;flawless&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> that user friendly.  </li>
            <li> was originally going to give 2*</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and it blends over rough spots like knees and elbows beautifully.</li>
            <li> No matter how well a tanner goes on, how great the color is, or how long it lasts, I won&#x27;t use it if it has that tell-tale self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Get it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lotions in the past and just put them on with my gloved hands, but it was never as, well, flawless as this.</li>
            <li> 14 hours later, I have a bra and tank top on and there are still no lines :) :).</li>
            <li> I decided that after I originally got it all over the bathroom room, that maybe I would try it again in the shower (easier to cleanup).  </li>
            <li> I will stick to the original from now on.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you shave first and exfoliate....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t originally buy this thinking</li>
            <li> I originally bought two 12 oz bottles, (</li>
            <li> And then you are golden!</li>
            <li> i was pretty pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I use to go tanning before I had my 5 children but since having them I have not had the time to get to a tanning facility and when I did find time to go to the beach I barely got a good tan</li>
            <li> The product works best if you put small amounts on at a time to build up to your tan.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this was better</li>
            <li> I got dressed and went to bed, all excited to wake up looking like J.Lo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> remember to exfoliate before ( better 24hs before first use).</li>
            <li> think that the comments saying it looked like dirt or that it washed away after the first shower can safely be ignored.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate before first use, that may be why some people were having problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a really nice smell and not a hint of normal tanner smell.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited abut my purchase.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the purchase and will be purchasing  again soon!</li>
            <li> and I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> with any product it can have short comings and it takes time to learn how to use/apply successfully and adjust the practice to your liking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most logical manner in which to acquire a tan... models do it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but in the past this company has delivered perfectly</li>
            <li> I used it first and just fell in love</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had such nice glowing, bronzed skin like I do now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> And it was worth it!</li>
            <li> will be adding a picture to show exactly how awesome the final product of the lotion was for me on the first go, and</li>
            <li> Just exfoliate and moisturize before applying and your golden bronze!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll buy this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was wanting and I will def be buying more.</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;orange\\&quot; knees and elbows and the fragrance is great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a self-tanner before, but this has to be the easiest, most fool-proof product to use, and it works fast!  </li>
            <li> A TAD MORE AFTER FIRST LAYER</li>
            <li> A LIGHT SWEET SMELL,&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you get such a nice bronze color!</li>
            <li> I wake up with a consistently even, believable tan every time.</li>
            <li> I am super translucent pale and just one coating is perfect for me</li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply, the color is a very natural golden color, so you won&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa, and there is no horrible after smell.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice golden brown, even coverage and super easy and fast.</li>
            <li> The formula dries very quickly, yet allows you just the right amount of time to smooth it on evenly.</li>
            <li> It creates a beautiful, realistic warm, brown looking tan, is easy to apply, and what little of the color that rubbed off on my linen sheets washed out.</li>
            <li> drawback to this product is that you feel bronze and gorgeous right away, but some of it rinses off in the shower because most of the color you get instantly is from the color guide.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  </li>
            <li> Easy, great color, quick dry!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as other tanners.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> it goes on so dry and smells great</li>
            <li> The color is the most natural and the mitt helps you get the most even application you can ask for from a self tanner.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair to medium skin tone with blue eyes and light brown hair</li>
            <li> After trying several brands, this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> and then I had to just clean the sink up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> By far the most convincing tanning product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I just want everyone to be as happy and relieved to finally find something worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I was able to do it myself and it really is streak free.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, great natural color and even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells nice when you apply it but still has that self tanner smell the next day which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, just don&#x27;t own white sheets</li>
            <li> The coverage is nice and the color is natural looking on my light skin.</li>
            <li> I could tell my freshly shaven and exfoliated legs absorbed the product better.</li>
            <li> tan lasts me about 5 to 6 days and even when it starts to fade, it fades &#x27;cleanly&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> The mitt helps to keep my hands clean.</li>
            <li> and it sure beats wrinkles and rashes caused by the sun, not to mention the dangers of skin cancer - even to the young and seemingly invincible:)</li>
            <li> It leaves such a natural looking tan and the mitt makes it a breeze to apply flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I recommend having a bit of time to apply it, you really want to smooth it on evernly and make sure to get every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and though I can tan lightly on my face, arms, and back, but not my legs!  </li>
            <li> My sister has more pink undertones to her skin and it turned her bright orange.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh as well, it never stinks like most sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be healthy and tanned at the same time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for a quick touch of color.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it in circular motion however its very forgiving and the coverage is so smooth and flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the kit comes with a pouch that&#x27;s actually the applicator you use to put on the tanner, no messy hands, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> And yes, rinse the mitt after use to keep it clean and in shape.</li>
            <li> Big YES from me, i would recommend to anyone looking for a nice healthy tan without the damage of a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Keep mit clean.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve used this 3 times, and love love the way I look...</li>
            <li> Feels light on the skin, dries quickly</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing dresses to work and this has helped my pasty legs tremendously.</li>
            <li> I find this to be the most natural color for my pasty skin, and also the most affordable.</li>
            <li> I think it would be nice if the mitt was more like an actual mitten or something</li>
            <li> I am blonde, light eyes, fair with freckles.</li>
            <li> I always apply at night before bed onto clean skin.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that this is by far the very best self tanning product I have ever used, and I have used ALOT of different products!</li>
            <li> so I avoid tanning beds and excessive sun exposure but a beautiful tan looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Because you don&#x27;t want to wash off all the tanning lotion that you put on your hands, and then try and clean the glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the next best thing to my professional spay sessions.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with the glove, and the color developes quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I do clean and shave my mit.</li>
            <li> Goes on super smooth, no streaking.</li>
            <li> I read almost every review and discovered that all the negative reviews said &amp;#34;I have fair skin.&amp;#34; Well I don&#x27;t have fair skin.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell compared to tanners that actually tan.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant until the next morning and you can still smell the sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Has pleasant smell similar to Tropicana suntan lotion that has that tropical, &amp;#34;coconutty-type&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly fixable though, just put more around the inside of your knees/elbows and then wet a paper towel or some TP and wipe off the tanner from any still tan parts</li>
            <li> But the soft pad and light misty tan spray made the operation quite smooth and very easy.</li>
            <li> It gave me a beautiful, deep, rich tan that so far has lasted better than a week.  </li>
            <li> Just perfectly warm and olive, very natural looking.</li>
            <li> And the mitt applicator was very soft, but I don&#x27;t know how effective it was if I noticed splotchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends in nicely and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not strong, isn&#x27;t streaky, and produces a beautiful, natural tan color--no orange!  </li>
            <li> This seemed to have the most amount of positive feedback.</li>
            <li> On a more positive note, I do like the color.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get so many positive reviews??</li>
            <li> Im very pale skinned and stopped using tanning beds because they destroyed my skin and this is a great product for people like me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply/spray amd spread and looks very natural!</li>
            <li> The result was streak free and very pretty.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing at first but changes after a few hours to a smell that it not so great.</li>
            <li> By far the best sunless tanner I have tried thus far in my 20 years of being an avid tanner.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and the tan it gives is so natural looking, no lines or orange color!</li>
            <li> As long as you wear the gloves and apply with the mitt, this goes on nicely and gives a great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> This one does smell the best of ones I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s kind of a chocolatey scent rather than full on fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this throughout the summer to maintain a beautiful tan, without the damage from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: One bottle of this has lasted me 6 applications so far, and I have probably 3/4 more left.</li>
            <li> Once it is washed off you will have a nice natural bronze that doesn&#x27;t look orange!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of sunless tanners and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Without a tan my skin is pretty fair, kinda blotchy red for the most part</li>
            <li> And it looks natural and sexy!</li>
            <li> And this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Used according to directions along with other reviews/instructions and turns out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and wow I love it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you read her entire review, as she has some pretty good advice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried an array of self tanners including Xen Tan as well as all of the drug store brands and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nice, natural glow though!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned (one step up from a red head, basically) and this works pretty well, better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Very light, not greasy, dries fast and keeps hands clean.</li>
            <li> I put it on last night and when i applied you can easily tell where it&#x27;s been applied so its real easy to keep track.</li>
            <li> The color is an amazing golden brown and the mit makes it completely streak free and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good self tanning product, and the best thing about it in my opinion is that is doesn&#x27;t have/cause that unpleasant smell that most self manners do...</li>
            <li> I tan well, but I have very fair skin, blue eyes, and I am older, over 50 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I do not think i will be ordering this again unless it turns out to be the absolute best tanning product after I try other tanning products.</li>
            <li> just make sure u put a towel on the floor when u apply it other wise</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll most certainly need the face tanner for your face.  </li>
            <li> You can tell this is a better product right from the start as it has a brown color vs orange right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> (I will mix in a sunscreen if needed), is non-comedogenic, and rather than using it instead of my special acne controlling moisturizer, I can mix it in.  </li>
            <li> But it holds up well if you&#x27;re doing it for special weekend.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t, then I will save this stuff for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands so this might not be a problem to most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not even use an special exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I would just spend the money to get an air brush tan for special events, etc.  </li>
            <li> the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> Works well if you use it right!</li>
            <li> , you can see difference right away!</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see the results right away!</li>
            <li> this product but biggest tips are exfoliate, do right after you take a shower, and apply in the shower!</li>
            <li> so you can see right away!</li>
            <li> my neighbor at work noticed my tan and asked ...and she ordered it right away !</li>
            <li> figured out right!</li>
            <li> but it rinsed right out!</li>
            <li> Throw away all your self-tanners and purchase this one right now!</li>
            <li> When you reorder (and you will if you love it like I do) you will get a brand new mitt!!</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and leaves even the palest person(me) with a even golden tan.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt it keeps my hands clean and allows you to really rub it in and even it out.</li>
            <li> Messy , but very good product 😊</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use and does not give a gross orange look that most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> Looks great and dries really fast (within seconds) which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> Best color, dries instantly, hardly ever rubs off onto clothing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super excited to see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> The most realistic face tan money can buy!</li>
            <li> It has a malibu rum coconuty mild smell and about the time to wash it off about 6 hours there is a very light self tanner smell which you really have to smell for.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply and you can dress right after.</li>
            <li> And the seller I bought from was such a great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty great product &amp; I&#x27;ll be using this for a while.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty great product.</li>
            <li> I think the scent is pretty good as far as self tanners go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars searching for that all around great self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> , I still hadn&#x27;t washed it, but it came out looking as great as the first time, but the third time I used it without washing it!!!</li>
            <li> More importantly, have to wait hours after air brush tanning to resume normal activities vs 1 hour or just sleep overnight.</li>
            <li> The color is not a orange like most self tanners, it&#x27;s more of a natural golden brown.</li>
            <li> I has a great smell, but no matter how much i put on, I barely got any color.</li>
            <li> first try gave me a believable golden tan.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely fair, to the point where even the lightest shade of foundation in most makeup is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good not a heavy odor at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing stuff, fool proof and EXTREMELY NATURAL LOOKING.  </li>
            <li> The mitt makes application very simple and it has a great smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li> No bad smell, nice natural brownish color.</li>
            <li> All in all so far so amazing.</li>
            <li> It works better than others costing two and three times more (yes, even St. Tropez, Bare Minerals and Tarte).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not that great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can use whatever kind works for you, just as long as you moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experienced this as well and to solve it, I just spread my fingers out really wide to keep the mitt in place.</li>
            <li> Lots of people said they got 10 plus full body tans with this product with spraying it on their body and not on the mitt.</li>
            <li> about 10 minutes looked good went outside to do some gardening</li>
            <li> Just nice natural looking tan tint to my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a nice even natural tan.</li>
            <li> and it was true.</li>
            <li> no streaking , no awful smell and real looking color</li>
            <li> I also love the way this one fades off very evenly to, which has been a problem with others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am now a light golden tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best, easiest, most real looking tan in a bottle....just fades after a shower but the longer you leave it on, at least 8 hours, the darker it will be.</li>
            <li> It takes me five minutes to apply this to my whole body using the buffing mitt and it is streak free!</li>
            <li> It really is so much better than spending so much time in tanning beds and risking skin cancer.</li>
            <li> The only good note I have about the color is that there were no streaks, and it was even.   </li>
            <li> To be fair, I tried this stuff 4-5 times and always got the same, not-so-great results.</li>
            <li> Everything it claims is true EXCEPT it is transferable.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and already have two of my friends hooked on it with</li>
            <li> It is true, as others have said, that when you shower after application (I apply before bed and shower in the morning)</li>
            <li> The color guide is very helpful in seeing (for the most part) where you have applied it.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good that I actually get complimented on what scent I&#x27;m wearing, as if I&#x27;m wearing perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot , and thos one is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> so I wear full sunblock and use this instead to look like I have some \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product gives a nice, natural color tan.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this product is how fast that it dries on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like that formula for those looking for a bit more color.</li>
            <li> I love the built in bronzer that lets you see where you&#x27;ve applied the product, very helpful for application.</li>
            <li> Good customer service, I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been paying full price for this when I could have gotten it here all along.</li>
            <li> For sure use the gloves under the mitt because it dries fast</li>
            <li> It went on so well and looked so good, then I took a shower the next morning</li>
            <li> Overall good, just not quite for me</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product for those that prefer to have that sun kissed look without damaging their skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice with the glove and gives you a natural glow.  </li>
            <li> I wore the rubber gloves, did not use the mit, put a good amount of lotion on the glove, 4 sprays of the colorant, mixed it up in my hands and then applied to my legs.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, even, natural color.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I want results fast.</li>
            <li> version by FakeBake because I love this so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a vain person, but all I want is to hide the cracks and scales; not look like a walking sweet potato.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much .</li>
            <li> and I love the way it gradually just gets lighter before you are ready to do again.</li>
            <li> Looks good but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> But overall good product...</li>
            <li> This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li> and I decided to try it since she provided such a good review.</li>
            <li> I love the color-my husband still thinks it was a real tan...</li>
            <li> I tried this after seeing several good reviews and thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that there is no streaking or lines with this product.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 6 days to build up to the color I wanted which was a light golden brown.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> :) I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> There is no ugly smell, just a coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> It produces a nice natural color and does not smell overly offensive.  </li>
            <li> In summary, it&#x27;s better than spending too much time in the sun or tanning bed.</li>
            <li> OK I literally have way too much to say about this stuff but</li>
            <li> True to word,</li>
            <li> This product works as well as the spray tans, honestly, and it looks like natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is also true.</li>
            <li> It looks like a healthy brown, not orange, and the glove makes everything so much easier.</li>
            <li> It give you a nice natural, even color.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> I got between 8-10 full body uses.  </li>
            <li> The color looks so real, doesn&#x27;t rub off on ANYTHING, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this product, looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Products like these are only as good as their users.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item is that it does give you color</li>
            <li> COOL</li>
            <li> Loved it but kinda left my legs</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li> A full bottle lasts for about 18-20 full body applications, i would say.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a shimmer (you really can&#x27;t see any difference), however it does help darken the tan from the Flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, you def get that instant bronze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is still some color left by Thursday which is good.  </li>
            <li> I really really like the color of the tan that I am able to get with this product.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it look good</li>
            <li> but once you sleep on it and shower the next morning, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> This product is very flexible and we love it.</li>
            <li> Tried it a couple times to be sure, but I&#x27;m very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> and I applied 3 coats, one after another and just loved that my body looked like I just came back from a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li> Many others leave me patchy or scaly, but this just gradually fades like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> I should add that I am a strawberry blonde with fair to medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> IT DRIES SO FAST :)</li>
            <li> , especially for us fair skinned folks.  </li>
            <li> You must know what your doing and have good technique to properly apply.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good self tanner, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> This will help the mitt from absorbing a lot of product (another downside to lotions) and it will go on more evenly.</li>
            <li> and you do have to wait a full 8 hours</li>
            <li> I am really pale---and I love this product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job in the cover up the white skin patches caused by vitilago.  </li>
            <li> Will need to buy something with more intense color.</li>
            <li> Also, the mitten that comes with it works very well, but make sure you have a rubber glove on your hand under the mitten as the liquid absorbs into the glove well and WILL turn your palms orange.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well and lasts for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li> I do love that it dries so fast  </li>
            <li> Love this product so much, I&#x27;ve never been streaky or orange and you know that&#x27;s the biggest no nos for self tanner.</li>
            <li> Going this route is much cheaper than getting spray on tans and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you really, really, exfoliate when using this.</li>
            <li> And make sure you get under your arms really well.</li>
            <li> so at this rate, the bottle will last a good while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the color, driest fast, you can see what it is that your putting on.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Work your way up from your ankles to your knees, make sure you are working the whole way around your calves and then thighs.</li>
            <li> * Invest in a good wand that can be used to reach your back if you aren&#x27;t yoga flexible.</li>
            <li> * Invest in a good wand that can be used to reach your back if you aren&#x27;t yoga flexible.</li>
            <li> But since I love the color so much, 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;7&#x27;&#x27;ish and a full 185 pounds.  </li>
            <li> BUT let me just warn you, that I packed a full bottle into my luggage when going on vacay, In a sealed ziplock bag to prevent spilling, and when I got to the hotel</li>
            <li> I now order two bottles at once I love it sooo much.</li>
            <li> but it also goes on with a red tone which is quite surprising.</li>
            <li> you get color almost immediately &amp; full color in about 6 hours .</li>
            <li> The color comes out evenly and natural lookig, and after one application when I wake up the next day, I feel so much more attractive.</li>
            <li> At first it looked kind of strange but after using the mitt to rub around, it came out nice.</li>
            <li> Love the immediate result, but fades fast.</li>
            <li> , that is sort of true.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve found that it comes in full force when I go to the gym.</li>
            <li> By the time I am done with my full body application, I can immediately put on my pajamas and not worry about it making my tan streaky.</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad...</li>
            <li> This product is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> So far this seems like a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as air brush, but at 1/4 the cost not a bad deal and can be used for multiple applications.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> It is not bad at all...</li>
            <li> think the price is not bad at all for this</li>
            <li> Not bad stuff.</li>
            <li> No bad smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price too.  </li>
            <li> You can get the St. Tropez self-tanning pump bottle for a little bit more, and it will give you way better, more easily obtainable results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, hands down the best sunless tanner on the market.  </li>
            <li> The absolute best tanning product hands down.</li>
            <li> The most darkest natural looking tan you can buy!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or streaky, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks very real.</li>
            <li> Very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful, and make sure you rub it in good right away.</li>
            <li> This might be my favorite find yet though; the mit makes for a SUPER fast application (just did a full body app in under 5min) and the toner helps to guide the way so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> It really is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t streak (which is amazing) and it last for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and I read so many reviews on it and can now add to those and say how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural looking.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is easy to apply and the color looks natural.</li>
            <li> So it does go on really well, love the mitt it help tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love the natural look and easy application...</li>
            <li> This product looks natural, and it is easy to do application, unlike most products that make your skin look orange.</li>
            <li> If I use this item and then go on a run I drip tanning spray but other than that its great for those special events where you don&#x27;t have time to get to the tanning bed for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have tried in the past 4 years!</li>
            <li> This tanning product is super quick to apply and when you first put it on it smells very tropical like a coconut kind of scent.</li>
            <li> In fact, it makes for a very nice deep tan (no orange) if you are willing to devote the time.</li>
            <li> If you just rub it on with the mitt that they give you, it is fantastic and blends right</li>
            <li> It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes.</li>
            <li> It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s buildable so it doesn&#x27;t show up too strong the first time</li>
            <li> is pretty easy to keep from looking streaky, and isn&#x27;t too orange looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This particular fake bake in my opinion, is best for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how easy it was to apply and the bronzer makes the tan look incredibly dark and easy to tell where you have not applied.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, and the color guide shows you exactly where the product is so you can avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, you can see exactly where you are applying the product.</li>
            <li> A lovely natural looking tan, stays on nicely, super easy application.</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this for those that have very light skin tones.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, looks like a great tan and no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, DOESN&#x27;T SMELL, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, dries quickly, and most important the tan is very long lasting and looks REAL.</li>
            <li> Works really well, very easy to get an even real looking tan!</li>
            <li> Price is great compared to other products.</li>
            <li> It looks GREAT compared to all other self-tanners.</li>
            <li> I have been soaking the mitten in hot water, but it&#x27;s probably more effective to actually wash it with soap (but I haven&#x27;t tried, too</li>
            <li> I also experienced the bottle leaking like some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Great product, it arrived 6 days before expected!</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of other purchasers and cut the stem of the spray bottle, which has prevented it from leaking as others experienced.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> So other than the scent, this is a great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> other then that its a great product.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers on Amazon have given great recommendations on how to use this product and I recommend you read those too.</li>
            <li> Two other things I&#x27;m not \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; about; the smell SOMETIMES even after showering and it doesn&#x27;t look that great on my face.</li>
            <li> Other sunless tanning lotions I used would leave streaks, give an orange appearance or just not work that great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skinned redhead and I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunless tanning products including professional airbrush tans and automated spray tan booths.</li>
            <li> Also if you miss a spot or put too much on you can just spray more on or rub in the excess to blend it, making it look natural and making it easy to fix mistakes!  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate and apply at night, and then rinse off in the morning, and I am left with a beautiful, natural looking tan!!  </li>
            <li> I tan very easily but need a little help in the spring and on my legs in general, no weird orange/yellow color, just beautiful brown!</li>
            <li> This is seriously THE best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful product for people with SLE who can&#x27;t tan in the sun at all, and for anyone else who takes seriously the damage that the sun can do to their skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best self tanning product I have ever tried and SO inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I did everything exactly as instructed, and the application was just fine...</li>
            <li> The first arm I did looked fine.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best out there.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This works great, easy to put on and looks so natural, has such a mild smell, doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves an even tan, dries quickly, and the mit prevents streaks.</li>
            <li> Repeat till all is covered  - Move quickly</li>
            <li> ABSOULUTLEY LOVE FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li> Ordered this stuff then realized this stuff is super</li>
            <li> The bronzer will wash off in the shower the next morning, but you still have a great color that looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> I began just trying any and every self-tanner that I could get my hands on, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with anything until I tried Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky nor did it stain my clothes afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I was applying it quickly.</li>
            <li> Got shipped to me quickly</li>
            <li> Over the years I have use many many different brands of self tanners on the quest not to look orange or have the product sink into my pores after shaving my legs!  </li>
            <li> I will continue to seek out ways to keep this from fading so quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly then I&#x27;m off to bed.</li>
            <li> Luckily I sprayed it into my sink</li>
            <li> The downside is the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The mit makes application incredibly fast and smooth, streak free.</li>
            <li> It dries super quick with no sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> so this gives me quick color.</li>
            <li> The mitt makes it glide on evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> If I were more diligent and used it more, I think the results would last longer.</li>
            <li> Then I blend in quickly in circular motion.  </li>
            <li> I am completely in love with Fake Bake Flawless self-tanner.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Fake Bake Flawless gives me better color than a spray tan in a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant, so people have been telling me that \\&quot;I&#x27;m glowing\\&quot;, but</li>
            <li> also really enjoyed this particular seller,</li>
            <li> I like the spray as opposed to lotion because of the quick drying time.</li>
            <li> I have always been scared to ever even try spray tanner, but now I am pregnant</li>
            <li> Washed off quickly too.</li>
            <li> The tanner dries quick</li>
            <li> It has a mild tropical scent that I like.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li> Another super</li>
            <li> This will stain clothing but if you need a quick tan this does the job.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> (Having years of experience in the beauty field, I know facial products work best for the face because our pores are smaller on the face than the body, so this makes sense to me.)</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> (Having years of experience in the beauty field, I know facial products work best for the face because our pores are smaller on the face than the body, so this makes sense to me.)</li>
            <li> It always arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> and this bottle is going quickly.</li>
            <li> I love fake bake Flawless!</li>
            <li> Something I&#x27;ll always keep for quick summer color</li>
            <li> I do like this fake bake flawless, I do! :)</li>
            <li> - I really love this Fake Bake product best of all.  </li>
            <li> It goes on evenly, dries quickly, and one bottle lasts me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> It dries super quick.  </li>
            <li> I was in a friend&#x27;s wedding when I was 7 months pregnant and needed some color for the one-strap dresses.  </li>
            <li> think 60 min gives a more realistic tan</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and never looks streaky.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake products and this may be the best one yet.  </li>
            <li> I am super satisfied with Fake Bake Flawless...</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> Most reviewers of the face formula say that this regular body formula works much better on the face, so I&#x27;m going to stick with this one and eventually muster up the courage to try it</li>
            <li> Love the Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li> Love Fake Bake...goes on perfect every time.</li>
            <li> But you apply the product and within about an hour you sart to see the results, take a shower about 4-6hoirs later to wash off the the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re left with a great color!</li>
            <li> This is a super product.  </li>
            <li> A couple things to note: when you are applying the product make sure to spray it evenly on the mitt, and apply in circles at a decent rate of speed to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> If you wipe it up quickly you may avoid staining said surfaces.</li>
            <li> This product is super liquidy (is that a word?</li>
            <li> you have to go quick</li>
            <li> The formula is great--immediate color develops, dries quickly</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild.</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> I have a very yellow skin tone and like most people, most self tanners are just way too orange/red for me.</li>
            <li> If you are quick you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking.</li>
            <li> Fairly Quick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fades Quickly (Gone in about 3-4 showers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> With this stuff, I put it on my knees and feet sparingly, but there are no streaks at all, and it dries so quickly, it blows my mind.</li>
            <li> I found the best way to achieve a smoother result was to exfoliate several days prior and moisturize the morning before an evening application.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a super novice self tanner</li>
            <li> covers evenly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the spray tan product Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice, natural golden tan color (I&#x27;m medium complexion) and the scent is not offensive at all....</li>
            <li> of now, this Fake Bake Flawless is my favorite self-tan product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly after you apply it so you don&#x27;t have to stand around nekkid forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now spray on my skin and quickly rub in.</li>
            <li> Drys quick.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to get some colour, I have wry fair skin and use this year round.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the seller they were quick to reply and my product was delivered within days.</li>
            <li> but i tried many more times and it was the same result.</li>
            <li> I use this as a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> rub off on clothing or sheets, dries extremely quickly and goes on smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of self-tanning lotions and most will give me skin irritation after several applications.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is super blendable.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted a quick fix to last me until I can physically go outside and lay out, and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell, it dries super quickly</li>
            <li> application process was so quick</li>
            <li> I just use it on my face to hide mild Rosacea every 3 days</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with the product, but I did expect it to be better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li> I know that with many spray tans they tend to hide these imperfections or even freckles more than your tanning bed or outside tanning experience.</li>
            <li> Once you spray it on though, be quick to rub it in.</li>
            <li> Goes on great, I dont get streaks or look orange, but nothing lasts like a real tan of course, but this is close enough.</li>
            <li> Fake bake flawless is free of parabens!</li>
            <li> The smell is much better than most self-tanners, but it does become obnoxious after several hours.</li>
            <li> I applied it all over my body and was super tender from trying to rub streaks away.</li>
            <li> it spreads quickly using the mitt</li>
            <li> I use this when I am in a super rush and need to get some quick color.</li>
            <li> like how the guide color makes it look like you just got home from Cabo, and it dries super quick unlike the creams.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It was a mild change, but I didn&#x27;t want to do anything drastic in one day.</li>
            <li> Ihave also used the fake bake lotion, gel, and airbrush spray; but the flawless is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just spritz it on an area and rub in quickly with gloves on.</li>
            <li> I love a healthy glow in the summer, especially on my legs when I wear dresses and shorts.  </li>
            <li> I have tested SO MANY different tanners and thus is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> Luckily with this product I don&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s still one of the best self tanners I&#x27;ve ever tried, especially for this price ($12.94 when I bought it).</li>
            <li> was super informative</li>
            <li> The mitt wore off extremely quickly, but you have to use it to apply because if you just try to use your hands with the gloves the solution won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> Just ordered fake bake flawless, we&#x27;ll see if that one has better staying power</li>
            <li> Use it twice a week doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes and dries quick.</li>
            <li> but mostly i turned red and more freckled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not orange when applied, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Is even easier to apply, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Alot of fun, and look good at the same time!</li>
            <li> I really love the Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> The color fades off me quite quickly, id say within 2 or 3 days</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind that it fades quick.</li>
            <li> This helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> luckily all came up.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply more and build to an actual tan color.  </li>
            <li> No smell, dries quick.</li>
            <li> It was quick to apply, I&#x27;m not orange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I&#x27;m tan for 5 days.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got immediate color, however it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day or two at most.</li>
            <li> I did want to comment that the seller was super quick in placing the order in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I liked how it was pretty easy to use, just wish the glove fit a little better</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and love it, came back for more; I would highly recommend it, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> mitt washes out very easily, and the smell reminds me of the old Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion from my wreckless tanning days.</li>
            <li> The mitt washes out very easily, and the smell reminds me of the old Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion from my wreckless tanning days.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> My Husband mentioned I have come along way with trying out Self Tanners and this was is so far the best as far as natural look and no gaudy smell!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this has some major pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless makes me look just as good and natural!</li>
            <li> It helps prevent streaking and it lets you cover huge areas very fast.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it&#x27;s the second time in my life I use a tanner in spray, the first experience wasn&#x27;t good (another brand), I finished with a carrot color that wasn&#x27;t natural at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and the scent is lovely and inoffensive.</li>
            <li> good for people with more pale skin</li>
            <li> It does have more of a tanner smell to it, but I still highly recommend this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a consumer of MANY self tanning products, I can HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have applied this three times now, and I do enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, quick dry and a beautiful natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> It dries immediately which I love because I can put on my pajamas right after &amp; go straight to bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that it runs off on clothing but even it does, it washes right out!</li>
            <li> Color goes on super smooth, no streaks, no fake color.  </li>
            <li> This product seems great at first application - but 80% of the tan washes off in the shower even after waiting hours to let it dry and soak in.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product from the same person each time and have had great success .It is easy to use and provides a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Great product except the mitten starts to wear down quickly</li>
            <li> After reading many positive reviews on Amazon and watching many positive reviews on YouTube, I decided to give Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li> this is great if you are looking for a subtle amount of color that can be applied easily without a huge time commitment.  </li>
            <li> The glove is also a great application tool, I was skeptical at first, but trust me, its amazing!</li>
            <li> Wish the mit would be more durable, after a few uses it doesn&#x27;t apply the product very well but the tanner itself works great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it staining clothes except in VERY hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it gives you instant color which is great if your skin has not seen any sun since last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy  and love the mitt I just wish it was double sided.</li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin</li>
            <li> I will say however, the color is very pretty...</li>
            <li> It worked better for me than any other kind.</li>
            <li> The original gives a nice tan, I am going to be in a wedding which is the only reason I want to be darker.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and very realistic looking.  </li>
            <li> Goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil in the spray keeps you from getting any streaks or blotches, the price is a steal, and the tan looks so natural that a family member of mine who exclusively tans at salons will be switching after seeing how just 2 applications has given me a nice, healthy, natural-looking tan with nearly zero-effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put it on lightly the first time to get the feel of how it will look.</li>
            <li> Also, When you first put it on (after shaving and exfoliating) wait about 4-6 hours and take a light shower.</li>
            <li> Great, dark color.</li>
            <li> This is the very first tanner that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> The only downfall to an otherwise great tanner is that it doesn&#x27;t really last more than a day.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and looks very realistic.</li>
            <li> First product i have found that is orange and streak FREE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanners before and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> The box is very pretty to me</li>
            <li> Which was my mistake the very first time I applied</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Hope others enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I really had no where to even start, but after viewing a YouTube video about how great Fake Bake was, I decided that for the great price and \\&quot;said</li>
            <li> Great for getting some color, but I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t get as dark as I would like.</li>
            <li> and I have a very consistent tan, which doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My normal skin tans ok, and</li>
            <li> I ordered it and the morning it came in, i put it on and was very pleased with the initial smell (kinda coconutty...</li>
            <li> price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake tan is amazing just make sure you rub it in good</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I have tried self tanners and been to get a professional spray tan done in salons but never found any that I truly loved until purchasing Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> it comes with, and drys super fast!!</li>
            <li> Came quick and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast !!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast!!</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy no dry time and is more of a tea stain color than carrot.</li>
            <li> It darkens super fast, is relatively easy to put on but the sprayer nozzle will sometimes leak</li>
            <li> So when you clean your counters, floor, or anything else don&#x27;t be surprised if it comes up with a reddish brown color. :)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think this product would be good for those who are not as fair and the difference in skin coloration wouldn&#x27;t be so noticeably dramatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly and had a pleasant coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the mitt really makes this an easy and quick self tanner to use.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it was so easy to remove the rest of the color it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> It was a fast and easy fix for quick color when I needed it</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, I did my whole body in under like 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> If used exactly as directed, this is certainly one of the better self tanning products I have attempted.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to put on and dried so fast and gives a beautiful tan.  </li>
            <li> Works great big difference nothing to noticable tho highly recomend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many self tanners over the years, and Fake Bake is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend reapplication  over the course of a few days, to achieve the perfect color/tone.</li>
            <li> Super easy little pouches to travel with and produce a good color too.  </li>
            <li> cause I have fairly light skin and usually do not tan easy.</li>
            <li> This goes on very easily and also not extremely dark.</li>
            <li> I know it is a good thing to exfoliate your skin before you put this on, but with the other non-sprays, I only exfoliated every month, and I was good to go with each application.</li>
            <li> And I live in the LA area so we have many options!&lt;br</li>
            <li> New favorite.</li>
            <li> My new favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li> I have used them all, no joke, I love trying new self tanners and gradual tanners.</li>
            <li> I live in the NW where most of the year it&#x27;s rainy and gray.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, gives an instant beautiful bronze to your skin and the color left behind (because,yes, a bit washes off in the shower) is beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> It honestly blends in with ALL skin types- from the fairest to the most naturally dark.</li>
            <li> Smells great (not the typical urine smell) &amp; you can apply in the morning.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  </li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions from a previous review, and this product works great.</li>
            <li> Works great at first then doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> While most of you might find this appalling, I was really happy about this.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and much faster than having to apply a lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have any odor.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to put on thanks to the guide color.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use almost foolproof really.</li>
            <li> And it easily rubs off on the glove when you blend it in, so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting so much product.</li>
            <li> I have to say it was easy to apply and extremely fast drying.</li>
            <li> That would make it top notch, except that it takes longer to buff on (with the provided mitt) than most tanners, and more than half of the color washes off with the first shower.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and dries soooo fast.</li>
            <li> and I even found a video of a girl showing how easy it was to use it (a real person, not someone who worked for FB).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> get a hint of color with the color guide which is nice, so you don&#x27;t necessarily have to wait until the full color develops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate really well before the first application and moisturize between applications.</li>
            <li> The mitt makes it easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell anything at all (as long as I don&#x27;t try to &#x27;double coat&#x27; without showering in between... not my brightest idea) and it leaves a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good actually.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is very forgiving as well and blends so easily.</li>
            <li> The whole process is very quick, maybe takes me 15 minutes, including shower.</li>
            <li> Some parts of my body were patchy but overall it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply, fast drying and didn&#x27;t rub off.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful long lasting colors and will be purchasing it for now on.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and is a beautiful bronze, and the results are instant.</li>
            <li> The application is easy, it dries really fast &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the hideous smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, dries fast, and smells like coconuts.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I liked that it looks pretty natural.  </li>
            <li> It went on very evenly and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and goes on really well.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy application</li>
            <li> Micro Mist is easy to spray on and seems to blend really well.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, the gloves and mitt that comes with it, help so much with the application. ....</li>
            <li> When you first use it, it&#x27;s like wow my skin is now a nice tan.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it smells good then the next day you reak of sunless tanner smell even after showering.</li>
            <li> The MIT is easy to use and makes it look very even.</li>
            <li> First, I love the mitt...works very well, wish I could buy separately.</li>
            <li> Although my tan did not turn out quite as dark as I would have liked, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless looks very natural and good for the first 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I can for sure tell that it is  staining my skin, because I can smell that \\&quot;fake tan smell\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t very strong which is good for everyone&#x27;s nose&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works great the first 5 times, washes off when you take a shower though, no real lasting effect and the effectiveness of it seemed to go down after using it more and more.</li>
            <li> It gives a very nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> While I am aware that there is a big hype for this product, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that great.</li>
            <li> This is the first self tanner that didn&#x27;t turn me into an Oompa Loompa!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more once mine is all gone!</li>
            <li> This self tanner is about the same price as the spray-on ones in Walmart, but it works SO much better!</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t last for more than one week !</li>
            <li> Looks just like real tan from the sun! !</li>
            <li> I have used alot of self tanners but i never thought in a million years i would find something i love so much NO MORE TANNING beds for this girl i love love</li>
            <li> The most natural self tanner ever!</li>
            <li> really works!!</li>
            <li> I got this product within the same week of ordering, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> After the first application, I had a TAN!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fast drying and smells yummy too!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it tho!!!</li>
            <li> Watch tutorials on youtube if you are nervous for your first try!</li>
            <li> This one has never failed me though!</li>
            <li> No fake tan smell, no streaks, and no orange!</li>
            <li> This seems to be as close as I&#x27;m willing to look and it did not dissapoint!</li>
            <li> First self-tanner that works!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first got it because all the reviews</li>
            <li> It washes off with first shower!  </li>
            <li> I use Tinted Love by Designer Skin, which is a moisturizer with a little bit of self tanner in it, &amp; I absolutely love that stuff as well !</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was aiming for!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Gives you a rich tan even on first go.</li>
            <li> You can see exactly where you are putting it!</li>
            <li> if you have a French manicure, be sure to wear enclosed rubber gloves, it will turn your tips brown!  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest exfoliating your skin first!</li>
            <li> Color fades FAST!!</li>
            <li> Have recommend to several friends who also love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> but I just blotted it on with the left overs on the mit and it turned out lovely!</li>
            <li> Will not order again and threw remainder, after first application , in garbage !</li>
            <li> SO PRETTY!</li>
            <li> People compliment on how pretty my complexion is!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it enough, Fake Bake Flawless is amazing!</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle and we don&#x27;t get enough sun to get a great tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product for anyone, but especially for those new to self tanning, as I was.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am looking for a different one though that doesn&#x27;t come off as easily and moisturizes my body more.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy to get a healthy tan look without being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I love how the product doesnt have such a strong smell.</li>
            <li> So easy to blend and dries in an instant:]</li>
            <li> For someone with very light skin, Fake Bake gives a nice glow that easily develops into a more bronzed color.</li>
            <li> As far as the glove goes, its very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> good at first then a few hours later its not so great smelling...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have heard good thing about tanning mouse for men and will definitely give that a shot as well as that is known to work great with hair as well and is generally suggested for dudes and may come back and adjust this review if need be after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> it has no annoying smeel as all other sun tanners do and application fool proof- very easy and smooth</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Great product for very pale skin if a light color is desired.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see this go on so sheer &amp; light while quickly drying.</li>
            <li> Best part of using fake bake is that it&#x27;s the perfect color for pale people and you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also super pale and was happy this didn&#x27;t look unnatural or orange.</li>
            <li> However, I certainly think I look healthier and more vibrant with some color on my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and quick to apply, dries quickly (smells like coconut), and gives very natural looking results.  </li>
            <li> When reviewing a self-tan product, I believe it&#x27;s extremely important to introduce certain characteristics of the author in order for readers to determine whether the product should apply to them.</li>
            <li> It tends to wash off a little lighter than I prefer, but it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> I used to love Sublime, but Fake Bake color is beautiful and rich even after one application.</li>
            <li> So little confidence boosts are always welcome.  </li>
            <li> Looks so natural!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the smoothest, best smelling, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; (The bottle does drip a little bit.)</li>
            <li> If used correctly you&#x27;ll have a pretty beautiful dark tan!</li>
            <li> I would honestly invest in something a little more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow this little bottle is awesome...</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 because the smell is actually pleasant unlike other spray tans.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant, almost like a soft coconut oil, definitely NOT strong or overpowering like most products.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> My husband is a very fair person, with pasty white skin and especially his legs.  </li>
            <li> its the best one ive tried so far its a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> The mitt not only keeps application clean and easy, but helps show where you already applied!</li>
            <li> But its not as strong as other tanners and comes off once you shower, and honestly for the color</li>
            <li> The first time I did it very lightly since I was new to it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after reading positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and package was secure.</li>
            <li> The color guide is great for even coverage, it can be a bit harsh to walk around with though-</li>
            <li> The mitt works really well for applying the product so it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It has great color payoff, but if you want to be darker you can use it a few days in a row until you achieve the color you want.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the most important thing we&#x27;re looking for in a self tanner (the color) is not so great.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply and it has a great, subtle smell.</li>
            <li> An amazing homemade sugar scrub to use before applying mix 1/2 a cup of sugar brown or white and 1/4 coconut oil and use in the shower (or anytime)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and never goes on unevenly.</li>
            <li> The mit really helps for a streak free tan.</li>
            <li> Gave me a great color after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Spray some on the velvet side and lightly buff over your whole body.</li>
            <li> Only used it once, but it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> it really gives me the tan look, but I do not feel comfortable wearing it during the day.</li>
            <li> Once I did that the next day I had an amazing \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, a bronze \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> you pay very close attention to what you&#x27;re doing and exfoliate beforehand, add a dab of oil to knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly,</li>
            <li> This is probably the most natural looking self tanner I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fake tanners and this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> Completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I read the and reviews, my gut instinct felt it would turn out like a similar product I own, St. Moriz.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice deep color ( Not Orange).</li>
            <li> I went to bed that night with a tan smile on my face.</li>
            <li> and I know how frustrating the hunt for the perfect tanner can be</li>
            <li> (DHA always has a distinct smell after it develops, but the smell is tropical until then).  </li>
            <li> I moved far out of town and couldn&#x27;t get a salon tan any more.</li>
            <li> But its worth the money with the gloves and everything.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> It is so fun</li>
            <li> But it is worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I was even able to apply it to my feet and still look like a natural tan.  </li>
            <li> The results make it totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> More importantly it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes the next day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural, and is so much better for your skin than a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The color is so natural, I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li> There is literally no inconvenient aspect to this spray.</li>
            <li> I actually used it one morning and showered in an hour and still had a nice color-</li>
            <li> With 3 uses, the bottle is still pretty full.</li>
            <li> Get compliments constantly on how \\&quot;nice and tanned I am\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Super easy and super natural.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wow this is my favorite tanner.  </li>
            <li> Recently my dermatologist told me to stay out of the sun and honestly I don&#x27;t like sitting out anyway</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Amazon for $13 - definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It produces a really nice golden color, dries instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every sunless tanner out there and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I can get everywhere on my own except for my back</li>
            <li> i have used a million self tanners and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This technique seems to decrease the amount of product absorbed my the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone desiring a more natural, bronze glow.</li>
            <li> Love it and have bought 3 bottles so far.</li>
            <li> so by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li> use a blend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps.lend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> I have a medium olive complexion and this gives much more of a natural tanned glow to my skin compared to the St Tropez.</li>
            <li> Most natural.</li>
            <li> As a pasty white gal, I get a great NATURAL looking tan that doesn&#x27;t make me look rusty or streaky.</li>
            <li> - the color was the only thing I liked a bit</li>
            <li> I think it even looks more brown and natural than when I use tanning beds,</li>
            <li> So far it looks really good and natural.</li>
            <li> It looks great and natural when it is applied but does not last.</li>
            <li> Golden glow, never orange,</li>
            <li> The color is a nice golden brown, which is the only star this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is the most natural look I&#x27;ve ever come across from any gel, cream, liquid or wipe (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot).</li>
            <li> It took me a couple times to master it, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, both expensive and cheap, but this has by far been the best yet.</li>
            <li> and it gave me a nice tan the next day</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple more times and still had the same problem, My best friend was trying it at the same time as well and had the same complaints.</li>
            <li> have fun putting it on</li>
            <li> but it dsnt smell nice anymore (7 hours later).</li>
            <li> It turned my skin a golden brown color upon application(not</li>
            <li> Returns are going ok so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially it leaves you with a bit of a golden tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments and everyone is surprised its self tanner.</li>
            <li> The most natural.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice instant color.</li>
            <li> and I thought the spray and mitt was a cool concept being that besides jergens glow this was the first sunless tanner I ever tried.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t worth it in my book.</li>
            <li> I have always used Fake Bake Flawless because of its simple application and really good color.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> Almost instantly gave me some nice color.</li>
            <li> Worth a try and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This color of fake tanning is great, never orange always nice brown tanned color.</li>
            <li> I have bought every self tanner on the market and despite all of them claiming to be the most natural looking tan around, always end up making me look like a walking Dorito.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to wear shorts</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a good chunk of time reading over the reviews for tips on how to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my purpose, has a decent smell, easy to use, and no orange color to it.</li>
            <li> It actually looks like a real tan and smells pretty nice too!</li>
            <li> The color is the most natural that I have obtained.</li>
            <li> I love that this product delivers immediate, natural looking color.  </li>
            <li> but I think it well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> After a shower it does provide a really nice, even tan for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> Nice, deep tan.</li>
            <li> Apply it consecutive days to deepen color, moisturize between applications and be sure to exfoliate well prior to applying to ensure a smooth, long-lasting tan.  </li>
            <li> I used this product once and the color was nice but lasted only one day.</li>
            <li> and you actually look like you have a nice tan</li>
            <li> This rinses off in the shower (make sure you wait a few hours) and leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Best product for fake tan have light skin and doesn&#x27;t turn orange leaves</li>
            <li> My own hold back for not giving this product</li>
            <li> I maybe going to use it this winter when I&#x27;ll turn completely white just to give myself a kind of &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It provides good color but any rough spots on your skin will be highlighted.</li>
            <li> Most said because it was old.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, looks natural not orange</li>
            <li> It is the most natural looking, streak-free self tanner I have used.</li>
            <li> Educate yourself, being brown isn&#x27;t worth your life.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it looks so natural</li>
            <li> I am outside kind of a lot</li>
            <li> I usually do 2 thin layers, and it covers evenly and perfectly!  </li>
            <li> but I found the color is not as golden on me...</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless system is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When you wake up, you have to take a shower, otherwise, the tan won&#x27;t look natural, more of an orange color.</li>
            <li> but it was handled so fast and with such good customer service</li>
            <li> The muddy colored guide rubs in, making sure you apply completely.</li>
            <li> My favorite besides the natural looking tan you get is the scent...</li>
            <li> : ) My boyfriend has also used this product and he loves the natural color it gives.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you want to be tan for the night, but as soon as you shower the following day all the color completely washes off.</li>
            <li> and wow I am glad I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it actually smells kind of tropical.</li>
            <li> I used one from my old hairpump bottles, its got a better stream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is totally worth spending 15 dollars a month on as opposed to 80 dollars on a tanning membership</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self tanners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Also, spray the product directly on your skin because if you spray on the mitt, it absorbs most of the product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of necessary...</li>
            <li> I figured she had been to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than lotion type, looks natural.</li>
            <li> It is the most natural looking tan you can get in a bottle and the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> but it is a golden Brown and not Orange</li>
            <li> , I think its amazing , and fast, not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> there is and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It gives such a nice tan to your skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hesitant about trying a non-lotion tanner like I was, this is well worth the chance.</li>
            <li> I thought they all were, it gave me a nice brown tan instantly.</li>
            <li> this spray just gives me the most golden bronze natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I love how it naturally gets darker with each</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to have finally found this product!</li>
            <li> I used two days worth of coats</li>
            <li> So if you ever need to reduce the color absorbed around toes or joints...</li>
            <li> Everything went on nicely with the mit except for my upper thigh area...</li>
            <li> I REALLY liked the deep brown color before the color guard was washed off.</li>
            <li> It works and looks natural for sure.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself allergic or sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes off but I dont mind that since then it looks fresh.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about using a self tanner, but application is easy, clean, and completely even.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful,it looks natural and steak free!</li>
            <li> FAR has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my white legs, stayed on for about three days then naturally stared to fade.  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few self tanners and this is so far the best Ive used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I liked the color of this product and the application was fairly simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth not leaving tan everywhere.</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure to wash the glove after tanning otherwise it wont be as soft overtime and might crack.</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is a definite must if you want a nice tan for this summer while saving your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> so it looks like you were freshly out tanning in the sun.</li>
            <li> and I look golden all the time.</li>
            <li> he would know if this came from some old can but had NO idea till I told hime :)))))</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> Def worth the money to try this product tho</li>
            <li> the results were better as far as streaks go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the natural tone</li>
            <li> I got some spots on my legs where the procuct was left in my pores but after exfoliating, it cleaned uo nicely.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you exfoliate really well before hand, and really rub it all in.</li>
            <li> ankles!&lt;br /&gt;the color is a nice golden brown, not orange or red.</li>
            <li> Find out if it worth to try</li>
            <li> can only compare this to loreal sublime bronze and banana boat for light skin and this product is far superior to either .</li>
            <li> I used and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> but I expected a lot better results using this after reading the reviews - I of course exfoliated and made sure I had no product (lotion) on before application</li>
            <li> Overall, nice product.</li>
            <li> Try Bronzbody, it’s worth the bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I cannot count how many differnt tanning products that I have tried attempting to give myself a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth some of the faux pas that I can overlook.</li>
            <li> Totally worth your money.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had was some coming off on my pajamas as I let it set over night, so don&#x27;t wear nice pj&#x27;s with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have found the golden tanning ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li> these 2 together, apply every 2 days, and you will be a silken golden tan goddess for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have light/medium golden skin and it looks just like my skin when it is tan.</li>
            <li> I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li> it would be nice to have an extra cloth with it but workes well,</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t streak and lasts for several days if applied properly, I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money, and</li>
            <li> It dries super quick, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong, feels light on your body, and the color guide is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl who researches a product in-depth prior to purchasing</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that you can rub it in seamlessly with the mitt that comes with it.</li>
            <li> The bronzer washes off in the shower and you&#x27;re left with nice, natural-looking color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only gripe about this product is actually a good thing, and that&#x27;s that it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the results are so natural looking.  </li>
            <li> It definitely leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It was a much  more reasonably priced option and it actually got better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only reason for not giving this product 5 stars is the &#x27;tan&#x27; starts fading in 2-3 days and starts looking kind of blotchy, so the cycle must be repeated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far better than any drug store product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> There is no bad smell, which is a first for self tanning products.  </li>
            <li> It is a quick and easy tanning system for a very busy mom that I am.</li>
            <li> love it 4 stars though since it states floral smell and is supposed to have no smell the smell is not bad compared to many other products I just am waiting for a zero smell product !</li>
            <li> I am quite pale, and I was happy with the initial application as the color guide is a nice, bronze color.</li>
            <li> Hands down amazing product!</li>
            <li> sure not to get any water or lotion on yourself after applying for at least 4 hours, but right after I put it on my hands I find putting a tiny bit of lotion of my knuckles smooths out any lines and makes it look perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it definitely delivers a nice brown tan but it washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised... I&#x27;ve tried other sunless tanning products on my very fair skin but they end up looking blotchy and orange.</li>
            <li> I have been telling others how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural!!</li>
            <li> I am an avid user/lover of this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, easy, non-streaky affordable self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to apply though you just have to blend it fast</li>
            <li> Its fast and easy and it really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no mess, no horrible odor</li>
            <li> give you super dark color right away, so you can achieve a good color that works for your skin</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li> The glove is kind of a joke, and a hassle having to wear another glove underneath, but the color is pretty good, doesn&#x27;t stink too bad, not too much color, lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to leave streaks due to too many layers of tanner or too many attempts to blend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: This is still my favorite tanner months after my original purchase, and after trying several others including mousses and sprays.</li>
            <li> It smells better than most other self</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the FB original lotion and love it.  </li>
            <li> I know I am one of the many 5 star reviewers of this product, but I give it 5 stars for a reason many of the other reviewers may not know about.</li>
            <li> Love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t as toxic as many other brands too.</li>
            <li> will give this one more try before I order the other one again:).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> DHA has been found to be deposited in the lung and other tissue thanks to this great vehicle.  </li>
            <li> Having used other topical tanning agents I can say the best use of this product is for the BODY.  </li>
            <li> and I get my legs and stomach done in less than five minutes which is get nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years, and this is the best yet (by a mile).</li>
            <li> it gives a believable tan and smells significantly better than other tanners I have used.  </li>
            <li> I think all of the self tanners have a significant odor,until  somebody will find a better chemical what reaches the same effect;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly and also washes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It drys super fast!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> No streaks, no weird smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> You really need to make sure you rub it in nice and even but holy cow.</li>
            <li> So I got this product pretty quickly</li>
            <li> and it washes off pretty quick.</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty quickly compared to some of the others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> AFter the first application I wasn&#x27;t so quick to throw them out...</li>
            <li> The mitt can soak up a lot of product- when spray the product on my skin and use the mitt quickly in circular motions, it is evident that a lot of the product is soaking into the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quick and I have not had any issues with it rubbing off on my sheets, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty even color, I&#x27;m sill getting used to how quickly it dries</li>
            <li> it dries pretty quick ..</li>
            <li> IT DRYS SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li> It has proven useful when I&#x27;m looking kinda sickly pale and can just slap some on (dries super quickly and yes, smells good) for a night out</li>
            <li> It develops very nicely over a few hours.</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews I had high expectations for Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but it leaves you with the most beautiful fake tan you can get.</li>
            <li> (I only apply self tanner to my legs) and the best part, I only need to apply this once to achieve a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> To begin with I have a very fair complexion, dark hair, light blue eyes and tons of freckles of every shape and size.</li>
            <li> &quot; &amp; there are many other products I use &amp;have used that are similar or much better &amp; they&#x27;re at cheaper prices on here ( Amazon) , so why settle?!!?  </li>
            <li> It goes on super quick, dries fast and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, quick drying, gradually builds color, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead/fair skinned, I burn super easy and never tan naturally.</li>
            <li> But, seriously, this is a very good self tanner.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that bright orange that some tanners have turned me, but it was still orangey and not a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and was concerned about streaking, color quality, and splotches, issues with other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Smells good compared to other tans in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> However the tan is superior to any other product I have used (which is TONS) in terms of color, evenness,etc.</li>
            <li> So the gloves create a nice friction that keep the mitt on pretty much completely throughout the process and it solved my problem If I were to really try to find a con</li>
            <li> You just have to be sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots, after my first application I didn&#x27;t really get around my mouth very well</li>
            <li> but other then thta works good on legs</li>
            <li> It smells really good and is not orange like other products</li>
            <li> AS WELL ,THAT MIGHT BE WHY OTHER FAIR SKIN PEOPLE SAID THEM</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t layer the product like some do, I would HIGHLY recommend a good body scrub once it starts to wear off especially before applying another layer.</li>
            <li> Left a nice, even color very fast.</li>
            <li> That said I have searched high and low for a good self tanner and</li>
            <li> I will most likely use this for special occasions.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> These reviews were right.</li>
            <li> so it fits right and closes tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I recommend shaving right before also..</li>
            <li> I put it on right before I went to bed and then rinsed off in the morning</li>
            <li> and they were right -</li>
            <li> but I could wash them and it came right out.</li>
            <li> I tried it on one hand right away using the mitt.</li>
            <li> and this is right up there with St. Tropez.</li>
            <li> It does not leave you streaky or orange and provides just the right about of color</li>
            <li> but it washed right off.</li>
            <li> Some tanners come right off and defeats the purpose of trying to look tan in a bikini.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying to apply once without the latex glove and discovered that the tanner just seeps right through the mit onto your hand.  </li>
            <li> so I can put on my pajamas right after and go to bed.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> I feel like the tan washes off right away.</li>
            <li> It rinses right off the tub.</li>
            <li> I spray it right on my skin and blend in with mitt.  </li>
            <li> I guess I prefer a lotion, but I would get this again if the price was right.</li>
            <li> I can put on my pajamas right after and there is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you know right away if you have missed spots.</li>
            <li> Comes right off.  </li>
            <li> but it washes right out.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not.</li>
            <li> It works right away and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I put a tad of lotion on my elbows, knees and ankles/feet right before applying</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail yesterday and applied right away...</li>
            <li> and I have no time to return it to get what the right thing.</li>
            <li> You will look tanner right after applying because there&#x27;s a bronzer in it</li>
            <li> It dries in about 10-15 minutes and you can jump right into bed without fear of staining linens.</li>
            <li> but it washes right out in the washing</li>
            <li> You can also layer it, one application right after another one, to achieve quicker and darker results.  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> It did turn my pi&#x27;s orange but washed right out.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get the application JUST right, the color is mismatched and blotchy looking until you take a shower.</li>
            <li> Just washed them well right after.</li>
            <li> You have to be committed to do it right.  </li>
            <li> The product washes right off.</li>
            <li> Right before I stopped using the product it was like smelling gas fumes.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and did this right off the bat and had no problems with the bottle leaking.</li>
            <li> its exactly right.</li>
            <li> but then right before i ordered it online</li>
            <li> then in circular motions rub it right on.</li>
            <li> PLUS, this literally drys right away, and you can put your clothes on as soon as you are done.(if</li>
            <li> So on went my quest to finding the right solution for me.</li>
            <li> right after its applied</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this stuff right after I take a shower, &amp; before bed.</li>
            <li> It seems as if it washes right off but</li>
            <li> The smell is so yummy like coconuts, I apply it right before bed</li>
            <li> Should have noticed it right away by the bottle that this wasn&#x27;t a continuous spray which makes a lot of spotted and blotched areas on the body;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, right away you can see the color change.</li>
            <li> I applied the spray right onto my body and then rubbed it in with the mit.</li>
            <li> I can get dressed literally right after using it, and leaving it on all day while going about your business is no problem either.</li>
            <li> I like the application mitt and the fact that you can see where it applys on your skin then disappears but for me it just isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
            <li> I applies it right after I showered.  </li>
            <li> &quot; right away with the color guide, if you will, so I don&#x27;t need to wait 4 hours until it shows up.</li>
            <li> right in the shower itself.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin color right away.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right.</li>
            <li> If you wipe it immediately with rubbing alcohol it should just come right off though .</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it right before you go out somewhere.</li>
            <li> I use it right after showering and lotioning and I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking or clumps of color.</li>
            <li> right after applying-</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters , right?</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It gives just the right shade.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on schedule.</li>
            <li> noticed color right away, but</li>
            <li> I even use this on my face and rub it in with my hands, and then scrub my hands with a nail brush right away to keep the developer from turning my palms orange.</li>
            <li> : I know it says to spray on the mitt, but I just spray it right on the skin and immediately rub it in with the mitt.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t turn me orange, didn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, even right after I applied it, it didn&#x27;t streak, and it looked</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the product right before you exfoliate, because it will take off some of your tan.</li>
            <li> I use it right after, then every 3 days after that.</li>
            <li> pale skin now has that beachy, beautiful, golden brown color that I absolutely</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless spray is my new favorite way to tan.  </li>
            <li> The only downside which I have seen in other reviews is the leaking spray top!!!</li>
            <li> All in all the color is great, the smell isn&#x27;t bad, it dries really fast, the color guide is really helpful, and it is an all-around great product!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, decent smell, and pretty color.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to clean up in a shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries amazingly fast (you can still add more to the dry parts to add more color or even out a streak) and doesn&#x27;t get on clothes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I have used it a couple of days in a row, I notice that the color builds, even when I clean my face with a gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li> it is how easy and fast I can get a tan with fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li> far as when to start your first application:  Again, this is just my observation -  it might be better if you&#x27;re doing stuff around the house to apply it then</li>
            <li> No streaks, no orange, smell is decent and it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Turn on your AC or make sure the room is cool enough that you don&#x27;t sweat -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking.</li>
            <li> Yes there&#x27;s a bit more prep than you would have with the average drugstore product but nothing over the top.</li>
            <li> It never oncesmelled like the typical sunless tanners (I liken it to rotten fruit), instead the pleasant coconut smell went away throughout the night</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is just as good as the salon spray tan except waaay better on my pocket book and easy to apply at home.</li>
            <li> It gives a more natural looking tan at first, and as you build it up you get darker and darker.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really notice that its everywhere until you clean your bathroom...</li>
            <li> Smell kinda like accelerator, but overall pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> not weird looking but really natural healthy glow to me rather than</li>
            <li> I just use a normal bronzer powder and I match just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they told me this when I got sprayed professionally at a salon, but I must have forgotten it.</li>
            <li> Looks completely natural, dries super quick, not sticky at all!  </li>
            <li> The color is wonderful, not orange at all, a dark brown tone like you&#x27;d want, and its instant!</li>
            <li> The only slight issue I have is the microfiber mitt starts to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; (like a sweatshirt), even though I wash it between uses, but I would be happy to purchase more mitts in order to keep my tan going.</li>
            <li> a nice bronze, not to dark, not to light, color.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you do not like wearing a self tanner with a dark color guard you can definately apply this after a good exfoliating shower at night, and then rinse if off in the morning for a fresh tanned glow.</li>
            <li> tanner is sooooo easy to apply and very natural looking too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to apply, especially with the mit that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and the color is very natural.</li>
            <li> The color guard makes this so easy and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The mit is very soft and easy to use, but beware--I had some fuzzies come off and get onto my skin.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It smells GREAT, it works QUICKLY, and you&#x27;ll actually look TAN, not orange, streaky, or any other bizarre color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product and I highly recommend it for first time tanners like myself since it was so easy.</li>
            <li> , the smell is great (because you know that self tanners can have a weird after smell), and it is so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> From cheap to high dollar.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Fake Bake spray, and it is quick and fast and did a good job, but makes a huge mess in my bathroom, which is why I decided to try the Flawless.</li>
            <li> The smell I find quite pleasant and is just tropical not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, looks like a natural tan!</li>
            <li> The mitt is intimidating, but totally easy and looks so natural!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and appears natural!</li>
            <li> Finally someone that did it right!!!</li>
            <li> After using many products on my pure white legs, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I did do a full intense full body exfoliating first and that likely made a big difference, as well as the great mitt that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skinned darn right glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> I cover up in a light  lose sarong for an hour or two so that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> I burn so easily that it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to get a natural tan.</li>
            <li> Gives great color and the smell is not too terribly strong but still not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I spray on the glove (soft side) and scrub lightly (but quickly).</li>
            <li> Works really well, easy and fast.</li>
            <li> I would suggest only doing one arm at a time and doing your legs in two sections (top and bottom) because the product dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is clean and free of all oils, I wipe down with a skin cleaning astringent, 3.Let</li>
            <li> Color good but messy to apply and wears off quickly and rubs off onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> It is not a &amp;#34;bahama&amp;#34; tan but looks very natural with my tone (I am fair skin and blonde hair).  </li>
            <li> I would like to wear shorts year-round if I could, but now that I am a senior citizen I am becoming self-conscious about the looks of my bony old legs.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanners, but Fake Bake is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> junk, washed off after first shower, left it on overnight, adn waited a full 24hours b4 showering, just junk, threw it out and bought Tan Towels, from Ulta, way better no smell adn no residue to wash off, dont use this junk of you</li>
            <li> No more stinky faces from my husband, lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanning products and this one definitely wins first prize.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great self tanner for a few years now, and this is IT!</li>
            <li> The smell is great and not stinky at all, I usually cover it up with cologne anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of self tanner and this has been the best by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else experienced this</li>
            <li> have tanned my whole body four times, and the bottle is still fairly full (1/2?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very happy to have found something that looks natural even though its fake :)</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried too many different ones, this one goes on smoothly and there really aren&#x27;t any streaks.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this stuff 1 or 2 times a week, &amp; it works great that way.</li>
            <li> am light skinned, borderline fair skin, so it means a lot if something actually gives me an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The orange color is much more apparent in the wedding pictures than is visible by the eye.  </li>
            <li> I used a patting/dabbing technique to apply a small amount of liquid to my hands and feet and it seemed to work great.</li>
            <li> however, I replaced it with a clean spray nozzle from a half empty body spray which worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It evened out my blotchy paleness and made my skin in general look so much better.</li>
            <li> Great smell usually.</li>
            <li> The bronzer/color guide looks pretty orange after you put it on, but if you exfoliate in the shower and apply it at night, you will have a golden brown glow after you shower it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> My husband is happy about that because he hates the smell of tanner usually.</li>
            <li> When morning came, there were no stains on my clothes or bedding, surprising because of the dark color guide.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the easiest and most mess free product I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> so I burn all summer long and never get nice color.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my face and it looks really good, not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I can honestly say it has never EVER</li>
            <li> I think it is a GOOD product, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Everything i&#x27;ve tried would leave me real streaky, not bad color, but the streaking was just way too embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It goes on dark and is a good color.  </li>
            <li> I am pale and this gives me a nice easy tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fair skin and super pale legs</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs thus far), dries super fast with a pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li> As someone new to self tanning, I feel like this was pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> But the shade of my skin right now looks so natural and the mitt it comes makes blending so easy and eliminates any streaking.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic self tanner though, and a must have for us pale girls wanting some safe color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out.</li>
            <li> It gives you a pretty dark tan (I am fair skinned) right away</li>
            <li> My thoughts and views are my own and are for the sole purpose of helping others know what to expect in certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> The instructions are very thorough and if you follow them, you will have a great color right away that lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply and it sprays on with no mess!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s such an easy product to use!</li>
            <li> This is our second year of using it, the color isn&#x27;t orange at all &amp; the mitt makes application easy with no streaking!</li>
            <li> This item took a little while to ship, but the actual product is great!</li>
            <li> but it is perfect for upcoming events when you want a little extra color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bottle, just to make sure I have it whenever the first one runs out !</li>
            <li> When you shower in the morning you&#x27;re left with an awesome little glow.</li>
            <li> it smells great and has an unbelievably realistic brown glow unlike other self tanners that turn your skin a funky orange oompa loompa color!</li>
            <li> This pale girl has a nice brown tan!</li>
            <li> I have tried many things in the past, and this makes my problem skin areas look more natural than most things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it is so easy to apply with the mitt and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky like most other ma do.</li>
            <li> I suggest light strokes and maybe a new pad because the pad keeps flying off my hands.</li>
            <li> This is wash the tan right off and you will have to do the whole process all over again!</li>
            <li> Id say around 8am or 9am and after the movie her was orange on his leg right in the exact spot he his leg on mine</li>
            <li> Even without the base tan though I was extremely happy with the streak free, easy application, BROWN not orange results :)</li>
            <li> , It was really easy to rub on and for a spray bottle it was not messy at all in thee</li>
            <li> Natural looking and easy.  </li>
            <li> Dries super fast</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old female with fair skin.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about it staining your clothes either, it won&#x27;t because it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It looked natural and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and made me look like I had a natural tan.</li>
            <li> Despite the mitt being flimsy, I still give this product five stars for looking so natural and being so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I regularly use St. Tropez, but thought I&#x27;d try this since it got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and it is easy to apply.</li>

            <li> /&gt;So far,,,, 5 star considering fast delivery. :)</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin I WOULD NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> though I love it and it works fast and looks natural.</li>
            <li> fake bake goes on easily and smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  </li>
            <li> I have found I like using this sunless tanner best a few days after a spray tan to make it last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> So finally I decided to try this product just for fun, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not orangy, looks natural and not stinky.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally olive skin and tan easily.</li>
            <li> now I can have it year round and for such a great price!!</li>
            <li> My (now-husband) jokingly called me pumpkin hands for the rest of the day, but luckily it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable in the pictures.</li>
            <li> And super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Leaves a natural looking tan and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It dries very quick and so far no staining on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks natural</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll apply and have a slight one, then wake up with a gorgeous one.</li>
            <li> I think all self-tanners can be a pain to use but this one dries quick which I really like.</li>
            <li> The tan is natural looking and the product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Take your time applying and be sure to buff the product in gently and completely.</li>
            <li> but the tan comes out perfect color and last a few days.</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft feeling and loved the color it gave me..</li>
            <li> Also you have to use quite a bit and put it on fast, it settles quickly and you could get spots darker than others.</li>
            <li> fake n bake its super easy to use and the color looks great</li>
            <li> The actual product was good, it gave an even natural colour.  </li>
            <li> I am white, very white and this works so great and doesn&#x27;t look orange at all (unless you don&#x27;t apply it as directed).</li>
            <li> This gives a really natural and buildable bronze color and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and i normally have pretty light skin.</li>
            <li> Not messy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Dark hair follicules, scars, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased 12 boxes of this thinking for certain this was going to be the best product I have tried and seen.</li>
            <li> actually quite pleasant and not expected!  </li>
            <li> , it gets SUPER dark and SUPER intense brown/orange right away, so I go to bed like 30 minutes after applying it, let it deepen overnight, and then when I wash it off in the shower it looks amazing like a real tan!</li>
            <li> This product is better than most, however it is not very dark once you wash the bronzer off, the bottle only lasts me about a month, and places like me</li>
            <li> I threw mine in the dryer on high heat for about 10 minutes and it came out clean and fuzz-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have just gotten more and more pale.</li>
            <li> It applies very easily and mess free.  </li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly and looks natural!</li>
            <li> The color developed into a natural looking, dark brown, beautiful color that  lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> For someone who has spent Lots of $ and Lots of time in tanning beds I love this product!</li>
            <li> okay , i first got this as a gift a few months ago &amp; immediately got more .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner doesnt streak but does get on light colored clothes if its hot out and your sweating or getting wet</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of uses to get the full color you are wanting, depending on how dark you like your tan, but I was seeing nice color after just the first application/rinse.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is so fair it is pretty much see through, and it makes me look like I have spent time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I did put more on my left leg than right, because it was darker.</li>
            <li> Not having the spray nozzle made applying this a hassle and honestly not worth the effort when there are MANY products with an easy spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> This came super fast and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Color is SO natural, application is SO easy and so fast!</li>
            <li> the first use!&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to you, the directions say to spray directly onto the mitt and then rub onto the body</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the color is natural and pretty.  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty natural and is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice and dark, super even finish.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I have repurchased several times because the tan is really build able and comes out very dark.</li>
            <li> Was easy to apply and really no mess at all.  </li>
            <li> and I consider the price very very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to very GENTLY apply the tanner, otherwise your mit will become pilly and crunchy (and won&#x27;t absorb the tanner liquid the way it&#x27;s supposed to).</li>
            <li> What I do like very much about</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Looks very much like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and left no streaks for me.</li>
            <li> so I ended up not using it very much at all.</li>
            <li> * Dries very fast and not sticky.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and it leaves no streakes.</li>
            <li> color looks very real.</li>
            <li> it dries very fast</li>
            <li> The problem is that even if you follow all instructions it still seems to wear off very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was very fast too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I reapplied before going to work as I didn&#x27;t see where the product had rubbed off very much on my sheets or blankets</li>
            <li> was very reasonable .</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> wear white or very light /expensive</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and evenly and lasts for a solid week.</li>
            <li> Well, I am very, very fair-skinned, so I ordered this product with a bit of hesitation.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast (2 min) and does not leave stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early spring before prom and all of the other senior activities that I wanted to look great for.</li>
            <li> Most other products I won&#x27;t use on my face just because they don&#x27;t go on smoothly and the color is always off.  </li>
            <li> Reviews on Fake Bake Flawless made it sound as though they had solved all of these issues.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and mitt work very well for a quick, easy application, and I love the delicate coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Blends smooth, better than other Fakies.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with a beautiful subtle color.     </li>
            <li> , it is good for those times where you just need a quick instant glow, and your product will last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, so you&#x27;ve got to keep moving, but it&#x27;s worth it, as you can put on clothes without worrying about staining,  or if applied before bed, your sheets won&#x27;t become intimate with your faux color.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, the color looks very natural and streak-free (thanks to the blending mitt and color guide mixed in).</li>
            <li> Success is largely in the technique.  </li>
            <li> Good product, however it does leave me a little bit orange at times.</li>
            <li> Gives a good tan, But a little orange like and streaky.</li>
            <li> Super easy application and instant color</li>
            <li> I love taking the sun, but every year, I&#x27;ve become more weary about absorbing the rays for more than a half hour for obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li> Its super easy to put on , especially if you&#x27;ve never used self tanner before .</li>
            <li> Super easy to use (especially with the provided glove)</li>
            <li> It goes on so easily and quick with the mitt being so big, and you can see it go on</li>
            <li> It dries right away which is great for me because I am a not good a using sunless tanning products, I always rush and want to get dressed right away</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, we all feel better and look better with a little color to our skin!</li>
            <li> and then shower to get the full effect (I highly recommend shaving at night and then going to bed with the tanner and showering off in the a.m.)</li>
            <li> Now maybe I just use too much, since I am VERY light skinned, it takes a whole lot (like 6 sprays on each leg directly onto the skin) to get me a tanned color.</li>
            <li> The little bottle goes a long way and the gloves included help application to be flawless.</li>
            <li> was looking for a great self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t cost too much, would give me a great, even, strong tan (that doesn&#x27;t look fake like those girls people make fun of, but one that actually would look as if I just got back from a vacation in the Caribbean) for someone like me-</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve been on a beach vacation ( I wish) since my life does not allow me enough sun time this new bottle of magic gives me that sun kissed look without the sun!</li>
            <li> Build-up: admittedly I am not the best exfoliator, but if you don&#x27;t scrub this off completely before reapplying, you run the risk of serious build-up / brown flakiness (I tend to get it most in my inner elbows and neck).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just adding a little sanity to the love festival to say it&#x27;s great to use once in a while, and be careful around the eyes, don&#x27;t spray it etc...  </li>
            <li> You basically want to get your skin as bare and clean as possible in order for the product to go on smoothly with out blotches or streaks, this also helps to allow the product to really soak in, giving it more staying power.</li>
            <li> Received my product in good time, and the product never lets me down!</li>
            <li> i used a quarter of the bottle with two applications, took two applications to get a good color, very dark color gaurd</li>
            <li> Once you have done it a few times it is very easy!</li>
            <li> Is a good product however doesn&#x27;t last more than a day and isn&#x27;t very dark.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable, and easy to use self tanner.</li>
            <li> But color regardless, this stuff looks SO natural, I am now a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I usually use St Tropez, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> lasts a while, i would not use though without applying lotion to you skin first.</li>
            <li> but I heard that the fake bake flawless darker does</li>
            <li> (This is after I waited two hours for it to fully &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> This  version tends to streak a bit more than the lotion, the bronzer to \\&quot;show where it goes\\&quot; didn&#x27;t stand out enough for me</li>
            <li> read first review from Glenis Ewing.</li>
            <li> But this looks believable, I use only one \\&quot;coat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and i love that it is an instant tan.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless truly is what they say!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it actually works!!</li>
            <li> but it really is pretty set after 10 minutes or so.c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying the product does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this and use it daily.</li>
            <li> It produces a nice, natural, golden tan that I get compliments on regularly.</li>
            <li> It wears off pretty evenly and doesn&#x27;t look blotchy..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two days, and I have moisturized pretty well</li>
            <li> THE FIRST SELF TANNER</li>
            <li> and it really helped me out!  </li>
            <li> fast service !&lt;</li>
            <li> (he used it first).</li>
            <li> We did it on him for 4 days and he was very tan!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get the product at first.</li>
            <li> I ordered Fake Bake Flawless on my phone while in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was the first time I felt hope for this product.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it promised and my skin was glowing for days.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply same amount on each leg, arm etc.</li>
            <li> so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied it, so</li>
            <li> just finished using this for the first time</li>
            <li> I also LOVE that you can get the top of your hands which is usually a challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is the best!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no foul smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try Fake Bake Flawless - guess what?</li>
            <li> when you first start using this product, you need to put it on every time after you shower.</li>
            <li> Ohh, and the tan does look real!</li>
            <li> I love the color payoff with this product, especially if I use it two days in a row!.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine there is a similar product that works any better.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and BAM - a pretty tan that lasts ;)</li>
            <li> I have used several self tanners before but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and this product was pretty forgiving considering my hap hazard application process.</li>
            <li> I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> One of the best fake tanners out there</li>
            <li> the first time i used it and that happened i messaged the youtube guru who recommended the product and she suggested washing it.</li>
            <li> It was not a shocking color change that would cause second glances, but I can tell it took the glare off my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used tanners more recently with systems that were more expensive and looked alright, this looks amazing!</li>
            <li> No orange tint or funny streaks.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as it says, a medium bronze.</li>
            <li> It only  lasted about 3 days so if you use it make sure  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for first time users.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> After the tan has had several hours to do its magic, take a shower to rinse the residue off.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> Exfoliate first and moisturize, then apply the product.</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanner for years.</li>
            <li> Love it would definitely buy again.</li>

            <li> Most of it comes off when I shower the next day.</li>

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a spray.</li>
            <li> I was amazed, the color is so real and not orange at all, I am brown!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is truly FLAWLESS!  </li>
            <li> Self tanning.com rated Fake Bake Flawless in it&#x27;s top ten</li>
            <li> Ok after a month I FINALLY received this product.</li>
            <li> Now here is where I think this is funny.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had this condition you know first hand</li>
            <li> Almost done with my first bottle and going to buy</li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t impressed with first application, did second application the very next day</li>
            <li> One of my friends, an esthetician, referred me to Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li> She swore by it and said it is nearly error free every time.</li>
            <li> I saw exactly where it was being applied.</li>
            <li> and it faded really well!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless about 1 year ago and have been using it as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; and ordering it ever since.</li>
            <li> What drew me to this in the first place was the mitt and the fact that it was a liquid and not a lotion.</li>
            <li> favorite application tip I picked up from a girlfriend is this: Apply the product to your entire body (even the face!)</li>
            <li> , my sister was at my house the first time I used this</li>
            <li> My first self tanner ever</li>
            <li> I did and extra sudsing in the shower to make sure that there were no oils on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product-the low price is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Love this product just purchased my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This seems to be one of the affordable higher end workable ones.</li>
            <li> and it helps SO much in preventing streaks!</li>
            <li> I like this the most out of any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used, but I still get an occasional streak.  </li>
            <li> but after the first day there were brown circles around the roots of my hair on my skin so you could realize it</li>
            <li> and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve used my one bottle many times &amp; still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I am real fair and have tried so many sunless tanners only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t want to spend hours trying to get it on correctly so it doesn&#x27;t streak, etc.  </li>
            <li> I will say the first time  </li>
            <li> Love the color and for the price I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I look tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not a regular tanner.</li>
            <li> Make the water as hot as you can tolerate</li>
            <li> The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous, which is a pocket.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it this last time.</li>
            <li> I can put it on so fast!</li>
            <li> BUY FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS!!!</li>
            <li> The mit really helps the product to glide on without streaking, and  protects  your hands from staining!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This Fake Bake liquid tanner is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li> Final color is not orange like most.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so I thought yes, first tanner</li>
            <li> It took sooooo many application and actual spritz of the product to get some color that I just stopped usinf it all togother.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It smells phenomenal and dries almost instantly!</li>
            <li> you get such a great look after just one use and everyone at work the next day thought it was a real tan.</li>
            <li> I use the fake bake flawless about once a week</li>
            <li> Might work for some others who have more time or maybe it will last longer for you!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li> If you want to have that tan look without laying out in the hot sun</li>
            <li> For some reason, the uptake on the back of my hands is greater than elsewhere, maybe because my skin is drier there.  </li>
            <li> Best fake tan I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> This was also my first time using a spray method for tanning..</li>
            <li> this is the first tanning product i have used that works without streaks.</li>
            <li> Constantly repurchase because I&#x27;m always so satisfied.</li>
            <li> But, I am still a fan of this stuff and will more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li> The color guide in the product makes it beyond simple to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated my legs first then applied with the applicatior glove.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> but if I can&#x27;t it never looks like there is a line, it blends very well!</li>
            <li> The first application blew my mind.</li>
            <li> so I am at a higher risk for skin cancer than some and tanning beds are just not for me.</li>
            <li> Performed exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> the first two times I bought it</li>
            <li> Even on my hands and tops of feet, no crazy lines or too much color deposited.  </li>
            <li> cut the inner straw attached to the sprayer as the top reviewer suggested, and have continued to wash the mitt after each application.</li>
            <li> * spray the MITT first.</li>
            <li> I use on face &amp; entire body - love it.</li>
            <li> the only problem is when u do take a shower most of it does come off.</li>
            <li> You can get that Healthy look without the the harmful effects of the Sun,and if applied correctly your not left with an orange tone.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store brands to higher end products &amp; everything in between.  </li>
            <li> Hence, my Fake Bake Flawless purchase.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I did at first.  </li>
            <li> the first night I tried it - thank goodness</li>
            <li> , I tried exfoliating first</li>
            <li> I really did was follow the directions!</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. :)</li>
            <li> but u have to be FAST when applying !</li>
            <li> The price absolutely can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many different brands of Self Tanners, I almost didn&#x27;t even bother with this one.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Depending on at what point you are in the application process (day 2 of the first 3 applications)</li>
            <li> I was almost embarrassed at first.  </li>
            <li> You get color after the first application and go from there.</li>
            <li> I shower first, shave my legs, apply my coconut oil moisturizer (Monoi oil,</li>
            <li> It is pretty goof</li>
            <li> Also, the bronzer which allows you to see where you&#x27;ve applied does come off on clothing/sheets and in water, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply this and go to the beach or pool without showering first</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tan I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My only lament is that I wish the color was more enduring.  </li>
            <li> This works fast!  </li>
            <li> But its much easier than using your hands!</li>
            <li> Very sastified!</li>
            <li> I have tried many a self-tanner in my day but this one goes above and beyond any I have ever</li>
            <li> The directions explain how to do it, so make sure to actually follow them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a red undertone.  </li>
            <li> Also fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Sometimes when i yawn a lot my eyes water and the first time this happed</li>
            <li> Over the years have I tried many &amp;#34;fake bakes&amp;#34; and now here is one with the actual name.</li>
            <li> It will eventually give you that self tanner smell, but when you first apply it, the product smells like coconuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty even...</li>
            <li> but the next day it looked alot better.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this from my salon after doing a spray tan and when I ran out, my salon didn&#x27;t have any in stock</li>
            <li> I thought I would check amazon to see if they carry it and sure enough!!  </li>
            <li> I read them and did exactly what they said do for application..</li>
            <li> I need something with more of an olive tone, and this definitely works.</li>
            <li> It came out a really pretty color IMMEDIATELY after application but washed off after one time in the pool...</li>
            <li> I was more hoping for something that actually alters your skin color.</li>
            <li> This is my ultimate FAVORITE sunless tanning product.</li>
            <li> Also a tad drying of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware too like</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different self tanners, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It really worked!</li>
            <li> Do follow the instructions and exfoliate well and shave before your first application</li>
            <li> It did make my butt and breast area match the rest of me though;)</li>
            <li> After applying the first application I went to bed, I woke up,rinsed off and was amazed.</li>
            <li> at least it is greatly reduced in this product.  </li>
            <li> love the product, and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve finally found one I love.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that because this seems to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I would definitely moisturize before hand to make it an even better even glow.</li>
            <li> You need to apply more than once a week if you shower daily.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake blends my tan lines perfect</li>
            <li> The point of this is, I still an on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> My first time using a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> Great color, long lasting</li>
            <li> this seemed blotchy when i put it on first</li>
            <li> then I ran across Fake Bake Flawless.  </li>
            <li> However, you must exfoliate before you use it the first time</li>
            <li> I did it for the first time on Friday night, showered Saturday, and reapplied.</li>
            <li> The only color I get in the sun is red/pink and more freckles.</li>
            <li> Go lighter at first if you are worried, thats what I did</li>
            <li> but this stuff, even after the first application.</li>
            <li> Health First.  </li>
            <li> i will definitely be buying this again whenever i run out :)</li>
            <li> First of all, once this stuff settles on you, the tropical smell leaves and you smell like...chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t laid in one in weeks since I bought Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not on my short list of favorites either.</li>
            <li> (__(*)__)  </li>
            <li> First time I bought this</li>
            <li> This is absolutely going to be a staple in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my tan, and some have even asked if I recently returned from vacation.</li>
            <li> it must be used properly :)</li>
            <li> I like to apply the Tanwise mousse with the gloves and mitt from my Fake Bake kit and it always works perfectly.</li>
            <li> at first gonna try sun labs</li>
            <li> I did notice after the first use that the bottle does tend to leak some from the cap, so</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It has NO fake tan smell on your skin.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I was believably bronzed with nary a hint of chemical odor to give me away.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use, but used continuously for about 4 days and</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price, but fades way too quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tanner stuff I&#x27;ve bought/tried/.</li>
            <li> I also cut the tube that is inserted into the bottle before first use, and have had no leakage as others have reported.</li>
            <li> To see exactly how to use this, go to youtube, type in SMLx0 and find her Fake Bake Flawless review!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, 100% Will be purchased again!</li>
            <li> So buy this if you need a pretty tan for a day or evening, but not if you&#x27;re sweating or swimming.  </li>
            <li> Shave FIRST 24 hours in advance of application.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, for the price, you are probably better off just going to a tanning</li>
            <li> I also made it a decision to add Fake Bake flawless into my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first at home spray tan</li>
            <li> No fake tan smell-</li>
            <li> The thing is is that this is my first time using a tanning product</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the patience and time to get the fake tan looking flawless for me.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best products from Fake N Bake.</li>
            <li> You can see exactly where you have sprayed it on and rubbed it in</li>
            <li> I cut the spray tube alittle smaller and it stops the product from leaking out of the top of the bottle when applying it.  </li>
            <li> but today is the first day.  </li>
            <li> I did not apply to arms as I&#x27;m already pretty tan on that area.  </li>
            <li> yes, love this stuff, would totally recommend and I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday</li>
            <li> However, a year later I can confidently say this stuff is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tank top that I sweat in and the arm pits turned red 9 months ago.</li>
            <li> This is my first self tan product.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless has worked well and does not seem to irritate my skin on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I still used it, and seems to work pretty  well.  </li>
            <li> It definitely does not make your skin turn that obnoxious orange color that you get from most self tanners.  </li>
            <li> Item was delivered a day before expected, which is always a nice surprise (:</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> It really does give u a glow!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give u a deep tan more of a bronze color.</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless leaks ...</li>
            <li> this Sooooo much going to buy ALOTTT Moreeeeeee !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the only thing I dislike is the glove you put it on with.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Well for the first time ever</li>
            <li> I will no longer use anything but Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many tanners but this one is the last I&#x27;ll ever use.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and it goes on very even!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Was pretty pleased overall with this product.  </li>
            <li> The tanner soaks through by the time you get done with your whole body, so you still end up with tanner to wash off your palms/fingers, which defeats the purpose of having a glove!  </li>
            <li> I think this is just because it&#x27;s the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan on using it much more in the future, especially as the weather gets warmer :)</li>
            <li> , i recommend going to find her video if you&#x27;re interested in it.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> I would recommend spraying on the glove first not yourself though.</li>
            <li> I tried the Fake Bake Flawless Darker after I finished my first bottle of this one, and I actually like the Darker better for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was one of those people who tan so much they look orange!</li>
            <li> We would shower and put fake bake flawless all over us before going out to dinner.(I</li>
            <li> We thought we looked pretty hot.  </li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t find anything that I like better, I will go back to this brand.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried fake bake flawless!</li>
            <li> I find myself correcting areas constantly with this tanner, which makes me use more of the product; meaning it will run out soon which is also displeasing.</li>
            <li> mo2MTW5LWRU7DPF]]My take on Fake Bake Flawless Self Tanning</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought a self tanner</li>
            <li> Since this item can&#x27;t be returned I am willing to try it again..</li>
            <li> If it goes any differently I will make sure to update my review.</li>
            <li> i went ahead and ordered it, and it works exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove.</li>
            <li> the tanner made my acne scars stand out more when i initially applied it.it</li>
            <li> It looks real and it doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> (I shaved and exfoliated first.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a much cheaper and safer alternative to tanning, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> THE BEST fake tanner out there.</li>
            <li> I use lotion first, so it&#x27;s blends in with the skin easier.</li>
            <li> First, it gives you an insta-tan.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, i buy it religiously!</li>
            <li> I love the final color.</li>
            <li> , it helped enormously in making sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the flawless results.</li>
            <li> I will give one pointer, the first two times i used it</li>
            <li> No fake tan smell at all.</li>
            <li> The first night I put it on, my husband came into the room and said, &amp;#34;do my legs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Just have to be consistent about putting it on or it will wash away in days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty translucent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty brown, not orange.</li>
            <li> I am having more difficulty getting even coverage on my legs, but I suspect that I&#x27;m not using enough</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my mother who has now purchased her first bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased Fake Bake Flawless about a week ago off Amazon and just received it yesterday.</li>
            <li> The tan is gradual yet you can def see after the first application....</li>
            <li> It may look streaky after you first apply it</li>
            <li> So this is my first self tanner I have ever purchased and used.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally tried this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product makes you instantly darker so you can see where you would need more spray.</li>
            <li> Girls, if you wear you hair up, make sure to apply this to the sides and back of your neck and outsides of ears!  </li>
            <li> For the first 2 hours, it smelled like it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> Now, when I say &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34;, self tanners aren&#x27;t exactly rocket science</li>
            <li> The first  time i used it</li>
            <li> Fake Bake&#x27;d Flawless helps me achieve that.</li>
            <li> Like it better than my home air brush system actually faster.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted, fake bake flawless is my go to self tan.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> the first one got there with no problem at all .  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well...</li>
            <li> After first shower, it was patchy in some areas, but that could have been my fault for how I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tan I think I have ever used</li>
            <li> The mitt that&#x27;s included seems to glide the spray lotion into your skin with ease and you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> THEY PROMISED, LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE PICTURE</li>
            <li> My husband even helped with my back to make sure I got everything even and non streaky.</li>
            <li> While buffing on this tanner, I get an instant shade of tan, with a sun-kissed blush color on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order the bottle without the mitt this time because the one I got first is holding up.</li>
            <li> I thought, Okay keep an open mind, you still haven&#x27;t showered yet maybe the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> I exercise every day which only makes the smell come out more.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a darker color or you have darker skin I would suggest  skipping this and using the Flawless Darker version of Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner I use after trying so many.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless...</li>
            <li> it gives you the perfect glow without the look of a fake tan.</li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m not sorry I purchase this &amp; will use the remainder of it, yet I don&#x27;t think I will order again.i</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about using this, as with most spray tan products, it kinda gives you a musty scent under your arms.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was some freaky skin problem, but it was just the self tanner.</li>
            <li> No weird splotches.</li>
            <li> Smells like a hot island babe.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> Dries incredibly fast as well!</li>
            <li> If you follow the suggestions in the first review it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> First tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used nap</li>
            <li> most of it washes out the next shower.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever used that did not turn me orange.</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tan I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Also has a more yellow look than I like.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> love the tan it gives but if you  dont have anyone to help you get the back</li>
            <li> Also, just so you always have everything at hand , make sure you have extra latex gloves.</li>
            <li> Still the best fake tan out there.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get a tan instantly with this product.</li>
            <li> After the first application, I have been applying about once a week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really picky!</li>
            <li> This fake bake is the best solution!</li>
            <li> I have used many and this is the first and only one that does&#x27;t leave an orangey color.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> (mine was done after the first application)</li>
            <li> Goes on fantastically, but has too much of an orange tint!</li>
            <li> pretty reg from now on.  </li>
            <li> You can see exactly where it is</li>
            <li> I have tried this product many different times, and attempted to apply it in many different ways....</li>
            <li> No streaks and a believable color on my blonde skin.</li>
            <li> You will need to exfoliate your skin first to prepare for your tanning experience.</li>
            <li> I use a towel on my bed the first night</li>
            <li> * a lot comes off the first time you shower.</li>
            <li> I have a light beige skin tone and after just one application I could see i considerable difference in skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best for the price.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I decided to try the one from amazon seller first....</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m glad I bought it the second day of using this</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It feels that part of it goes away when you take the first shower.</li>
            <li> so it was even more so obvious for</li>
            <li> This product left me a bit orange but not horribly.</li>
            <li> However, it was the first self-tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty soup (AKA: DHA).</li>
            <li> It really makes you look tan and not orange at all!</li>
            <li> It can be streaky if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing the first time you are applying it</li>
            <li> Yes, it tans you pretty well with one application.</li>
            <li> Most of color washes off in the Shower next day.</li>
            <li> This really boosted my confidence!</li>
            <li> I showered the next morning, and most of it washed off, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a more greenish undertone and this looked kinda red,</li>
            <li> Okay, people I have been using self tanner on and off since middle school</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t look fake or orange and smells great!</li>
            <li> I convinced my bf to let me give him his first tan.</li>
            <li> It goes on even and fades pretty evenly too which i like</li>
            <li> The application is pretty foolproof and the mitt allows for an even covering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter my discovery of Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange.</li>
            <li> I would apply first thing in the morning and shower it off before bed</li>
            <li> My first one I didn&#x27;t trim and it resulted in it leaking around the edge...</li>
            <li> and I plan to double team myself with this product and that one in hopes I&#x27;ll have a more stable tan</li>
            <li> and I plan to double team myself with this product and that one in hopes I&#x27;ll have a more stable tan</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product through my hair dresser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok so I am very white</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in a while that I&#x27;ve used a self tanning product.</li>
            <li> I did find the smell to linger about for a day or so even after my first morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was expecting the excess colour to wash off in the shower the first time after applying it, so that wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me.</li>
            <li> What I did, because I totally freaked out the first time I seen it, was apply some more baby oil to those areas and blended it with the rest of the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it caused my legs to break out, which many tanning lotions do to my legs.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many various products while others streak and look orange</li>
            <li> I now am confident to take on summer with any outfit (especially my bikini)!</li>
            <li> I spray directly onto my skin and smooth in with the mitt for</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic if you want an instant tan</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of self tanning products.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> It works well but make sure you have a day or so before going in public.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update with overall body review: Okay-</li>
            <li> First of all, it is a spray need</li>
            <li> If you are wondering if this product does what it says, I can tell you that it absolutely does 100%!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I wasn&#x27;t orange.</li>
            <li> (like I did the first time) and use 2 ziplock bags &amp; an additional plastic bag over the two ziplock,</li>
            <li> As an avid tanner, I&#x27;ve tried everything from tanning booths to spray tans to self tanners.</li>
            <li> BEST fake tanner around.</li>
            <li> im almost done with my first bottle of this</li>
            <li> but I just need to get that death glow off my legs when I first wear skirts without stockings in the spring.</li>
            <li> I just got my fake bake flawless today.</li>
            <li> and I just wasn&#x27;t aware.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> In just two days I&#x27;ve gone from pasty white to a respectable (i.e., not a vampire) color, and there&#x27;s been no streaking or uneveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure that you shower, don&#x27;t take a bath after set hours after becuase you will rinse off the extra.</li>
            <li> I literally had to apply it consistently to get the desired color.</li>
            <li> I WOULD FOLLOW BOX DIRECTIONS AND EXFOLIATE FIRST AND SHOWER</li>
            <li> FIRST</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to absolutely anyone!</li>
            <li> I decided to try something else because the Cali Tan Spray is more like a bronzing last minute spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened package to the Fake Bake Flawless, I remember reading a review about it regarding snipping the end of the spray tube that goes inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looked streaky when I first applied it</li>
            <li> If you properly prepare your skin, exfoliate and shave, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best Fake tan product on the market.</li>
            <li> And between you and me, my boss is kinda hot.</li>
            <li> No weird smell.  </li>
            <li> I also have washed the mitt after each use to prolong the life of it &amp; to keep it soft so the spray continues to go on streak free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and have LOVED it..</li>
            <li> but a beautiful golden tan stays behind.</li>
            <li> few streaks, good coverage and tan color not orange.</li>
            <li> -The color is good, IF you plan to apply it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and always have had trouble tanning in beds.  </li>
            <li> If you should end up with some areas darker than others, just exfoliate those spots rather heavily and they will blend in fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just a little bit so the product can flow more easily.</li>
            <li> Follow other reviews, be sure to shower first and do application in the shower for clean up.  </li>
            <li> There is no bending in odd angles naked in the shower while a very very good friend spray paints your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading numerous reviews and watching a half dozen tutorial videos on youtube, I decided to try this for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with Fake Bake products for years now, but this new formula is by far their best yet!!</li>
            <li> If you need a quick, effortless than I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> -I found it easy to apply, but you have to work fast and have a light hand,with long movements and circular ones too;&lt;br /&gt;-have</li>
            <li> Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I looked around on the internet for hours before I finally decided to pick up the Fake Bake Flawless, and I so far really love it!</li>
            <li> The girl that demonstrated it on youtube was quite pale and she turned a gorgeous tan</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m so pale, I can put one application on and I&#x27;m good to go for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product if you are ridiculously pale like I am.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, using the color guard to show you where it has been applied, and provides an instant golden tan.</li>
            <li> My only beef is that the mitt pills quickly, but I guess this isn&#x27;t a huge deal since one comes with every box</li>
            <li> but I have super white light skin</li>
            <li> The first is- the smell after it settles isn&#x27;t pleasant (baked skin smell), but I can get past it.</li>
            <li> The mitt is very nice to have too, as gloves can be hard to work with...</li>
            <li> --I ended up spraying the product directly onto my skin and THEN using the mit to rub it in!!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it really is streak free &amp; smells way better than other self tanners .</li>
            <li> The bronzer is really helpful during application, and washes right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, just my experiences- but I always try to be fair and plain spoken in all my reviews.</li>
            <li> I worked out today and scrubbed the bathroom with cleaners and showered again still dark super easy awsome color !</li>
            <li> Never ever have I gotten such amazing brown natural color!</li>
            <li> Ive used A LOT of different tanners, and this by FAR is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is the most realistic, easiest to use, best-smelling fake tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless leaves me with a nice, natural looking tan, especially with the mitten that comes with it</li>
            <li> It dries instantly so its not messy at all, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, and it smells nice like coconut sunblock not gross like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> luckily, touch-ups are not hard with this</li>
            <li> This product is different - you are actually getting nice brown tan right away after applying !</li>
            <li> Caution for older women, makes your age spots more apparent.</li>
            <li> True, but I am getting older and want to try to protect my skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews are for real!  </li>
            <li> I purchased fake bake flawless in order to get tanned up for a large formal event I had to attend.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want a football shaped outline on your cheeks when you bend over :)  Same for large breasts, use a cotton bra that fits all the way in under the breast to absorb any sweating.           </li>
            <li> This product lasts a week without applying more before I start to see it fading in certain areas by my inner arm.</li>
            <li> This gives a very natural color with no stains on hands/fingers and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> This product will also significantly darken scars and acne, so I recommend somehow maintaining a reasonably clear complexion while using this on your skin.</li>
            <li> that just gets better as the hours go on, and it&#x27;s build-able depending on how dark you wanna go (I find two days in a row of application is a medium-dark tan)&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing for a self tanner, very similar to coconut tanning oil</li>
            <li> I have them for other purposes since I tint &amp; highlight my own hair.</li>
            <li> but other then that, does give you a nice glow</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too, not like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Is much lighter than the original and takes several days to achieve what the original does in one.</li>
            <li> The tan is just warm enough, just cool enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the most part, however it takes a while to blend in because spraying onto the mit then onto the skin is a tedious process.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to a friend, but only if they weren&#x27;t willing to spend the extra $20 for the St. Tropez tanner, which I believe is definitely superior.</li>
            <li> but so far the color looks ok and pretty natural.</li>
            <li> On the first try I was even able to get my whole back</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so when I found this product I was excited.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was nervous buying this product because all the other self tanners were in aerosol cans</li>
            <li> The color is nice but that odor , like other self-tanners, lingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also smells much better than most tanners when putting it on, at least at first.</li>
            <li> The nice, deeper color I had hoped for, after using the other product.  </li>
            <li> I always had a hard time tanning my inner arm and this works great!!  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and this gives beautiful, very natural color to even the palest girl.  </li>
            <li> I waited until the next evening to shower, even though it says you only need to wait 4-6 hrs, and after i showered, I was a streaked mess and most of the beautiful color was gone.</li>
            <li> color guard makes sure you don&#x27;t mess up.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great for the first few hours.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the original formula again!</li>
            <li> Super natural, a nice bronze color as if I live on a tropical island and spend all day outside!</li>
            <li> I advise washing the mug frequently, otherwise you will turn green lol</li>
            <li> It goes on so well, color is great and subtle.</li>
            <li> As a middle aged man, the combo looks great with my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li> As a middle aged man, the combo looks great with my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li> If you are sure to cover all skin area when applying (don&#x27;t be afraid to repeat over an area) you&#x27;ll have great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them, and I haven&#x27;t been 100% happy with any of them...until now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it worked really amazing, and just after one night.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It really went on smooth and looked so natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to see where you need to apply more as there is a darker guide color that gradually sinks in for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> even when NOT in use all over the box, i had to put toilet paper on the top so that it doesnt bleed out when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But even though I applied it before bed so that it had a chance to thorougly dry most of it washed off, but enough color was added to make it worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> I dont know how dark this would be on super pake skin, but I would for sure stick to 60 minutes at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head who has had melanoma, so I use 70spf daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year in the summer, and it worked really well, but you had to be sure diligent on application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the mitt that comes with this stuff to make for a smooth application, or if it&#x27;s the product or both, but the color is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t smell chemically after it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li> The absolute best fake tan spray or cream  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless really is error proof.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely zero complaints regarding this Fake Bake Flawless product</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake because the color is perfect for me</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanners and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, and have tried many different types of sunless tanners over the years (sprays, creams, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s really not that strong but over time your nose doesn&#x27;t want anything to do with it, and on top of that you can&#x27;t shower because it washes completely</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews before purchasing this product, but I am not impressed with this.</li>
            <li> but it works really well for me &amp; goes on sheer &amp; the more</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a better color, it&#x27;s sooo much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, the smell is nice, but Fake Bake &amp;#34;Flawless,&amp;#34; it seems, is inherently flawed:&lt;br /&gt;A)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning beds off and on during the summer time for a good 8 years, I am only 28 and was recently diagnosed with Melanoma.</li>
            <li> Thats the only way to make sure you havent missed any spots or applied too much in one area.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough (especially with no smell!).</li>
            <li> I got this after trying several different things including the Tan Towel (which I did not like) - I loved this after</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better for someone who already has some color and just wants an extra boost.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is more of a \\&quot;builder\\&quot; fake tan, which is really good for anyone of any skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I am selling my tanning bed since I&#x27;m starting to get nervous about melanoma cancer.</li>
            <li> This is only my second self-tanner I have used but color wise</li>
            <li> Truthfully, when I opened the package I was really nervous if the bottle would have been open and used.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with the Jergen&#x27;s daily tanner since this isn&#x27;t a good &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake Flawless before, but ordered it at amazon from this seller because it is so much cheaper compared to Ulta $25+.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought my 2nd bottle because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> following the proven instructions to apply self tanner (Shower, Exfoliate, Moisturize) I found it to be quite a simple process that had good</li>
            <li> I researched this product along with a few others and I decided I wanted a self tanner that would be fast drying and smell good</li>
            <li> am buying more next week and be ready for summer.</li>
            <li> Gives a good natural color only problem is it&#x27;s very sensitive to water and</li>
            <li> The first suggestion of trimming the dip tube was smart and also cleaning the mitt after each use.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful and follow the instructions it is very easy and</li>
            <li> This is very dark stuff and when sprayed it was quite surprised that it more splattered from the bottle than sprayed in a fine mist!</li>
            <li> And it darkened over the next few hours and just looked better and better!</li>
            <li> the color was great and natural looking, but I followed the directions exactly (even left extra drying time) and put it on at night, as directed.</li>
            <li> I now have a scar on my chest, less than cute!</li>
            <li> Also, did not break out my super sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I love the mitt that comes with it because it really provides a smooth application, not to mention it really cut down on the amount of time that it took me to apply.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use a self tanner to try and be a little bit more healthy.</li>
            <li> One coat gave me a good non-artificial look (no orange color) and I used very little of the product.</li>
            <li> hardly no color!!</li>
            <li> and I am super dark, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Application is easy although I am weary of how long the mitt will be useful.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate your body to get rid of dry spots, and you&#x27;ll be looking beach ready!</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but seems to go pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> Color is very natural and there is no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> One thing that is definitely positive though is that you get color immediately and it lasts for a couple days, if you don&#x27;t reapply.</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> /&gt;Believe the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> On a positive note I don&#x27;t even like coconut</li>
            <li> Read another positive review with suggestions to counter others complaints.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks more natural than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Hence the reason the directions say spray at night and take a (VERY LIGHT) shower in the morning and pat, NOT RUB, yourself dry.  </li>
            <li> The mitt makes for easy application and washes out easily with a little baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> At least try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> The color is great, lasts only a few days, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks natural, dries fast, smells great and lasts even after showering a few times.</li>
            <li> I recommend starting out with a light application and adding more the next day if a darker color is desired.</li>
            <li> Not too much color once you shower but still a pretty glow.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use Fake Bake, as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> It is always better to have it too long than too short.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever using a self tanning product (or before a spray tan)</li>
            <li> Due to turning 39 and the effects of tanning becoming more noticeable on my face and chest at an ever increasing speed, every year I spend a few hundred dollars buying all the number one, two and three top brands on the review lists.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying the version made for face next, although so far I&#x27;m happy with this product overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying the version made for face next, although so far I&#x27;m happy with this product overall.</li>
            <li> worry about staining clothes, it washes out of any clothes you may get this on if you aren&#x27;t able to shower (or choose not to if you want to keep the bronzer on for a stronger tanned look, which I recommend as long as it&#x27;s within controlled temperatures).&lt;br /&gt;Unlike St. Tropez</li>
            <li> It washes off pretty fast too.  </li>
            <li> I started with the Original Fake Bake Lotion and just recently bought my first bottle of Flawless.</li>
            <li> (it really is that fast!), and sleep on a towelovernight.</li>
            <li> It will stay on after showering for the most part as long as you don&#x27;t scrub yourself too vigorously.</li>
            <li> The weather has turned warm and my ghostly white legs were just not ready to see the light of day</li>
            <li> My first experience with a self tanner was a St. Tropez gradual tanning lotion that I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> but I am OK with this one as long as I wait a day after I shave.</li>
            <li> The mitt is okay, it&#x27;s starting to fall apart on me, but I feel like that&#x27;s pretty normal.</li>
            <li> but the tan pretty much fades in a week.  </li>
            <li> (make sure to leave on as long as they suggest)</li>
            <li> I lastly lightly rub mitt on the top only of my hands without any extra spray.</li>
            <li> The rest of it is pretty much self explanatory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much anything out there.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I will add to my long term routine for sure.</li>
            <li> [...] Be careful if you do this in the morning fresh out of the shower, because wearing the color guard all day can get messed up when doing things like dishes, hanging wet laundry, or if you end up getting rained on lol.</li>
            <li> and I was very hesitant about it since this was my first foray into self-tanning.</li>
            <li> Also it pretty much washed off in the shower, which I took 14 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li> will be using this for as long as it is made :)</li>
            <li> Mostly I feel as though I should wear a sign saying &amp;#34;Fake tan here.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve long since stopped sunning myself, and tanning beds are not safe-so what to do?</li>
            <li> it looks like a real tan not a fake one..</li>
            <li> At first when I applied it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but as time passed I could see it getting darker.</li>
            <li> It pretty much washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> First of all, the package arrived amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> but I recommend doing your face first before too much product soaks into the mitt.</li>
            <li> There is a review (voted most Helpfil) which I won&#x27;t rehash.</li>
            <li> When applying this you can see exactly what it looks like and rinse off excess color if you have applied to much.</li>
            <li> Not as much upkeep as other tanners which is nice.</li>
            <li> Make sure you trim the spray tube so it isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> The dark side of the application mit kind of holds the product and it doesn&#x27;t come through onto your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Wash</li>
            <li> It will give you a nice, dark color</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re nice and dark.</li>
            <li> The only issue is you need to really buff it in good for a solid all over color.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I have loved this product in the past.</li>
            <li> just one bit of advice if you have scars, scrapes or any kind of marks on your skin the dark spray will set in and illuminate these flaws on your skin.</li>
            <li> For a comparison, I changed my makeup 2 shades darker than I would usually wear (I&#x27;m fair skinned).  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak, not at all orange, nice dark brown color.</li>
            <li> use a balm of some kind on ankles, wrists, knees and elbows to blend in and prevent areas from getting too dark or blotchy.  </li>
            <li> The color is a gorgeous brown instead of orangey like spray tans usually come out.</li>
            <li> No orange tinge just a nice tan that you can build up to as dark as you want.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it was as good as the 2 I&#x27;ve used in the past that have both disappeared from the market.  </li>
            <li> It gives my pale skin the most natural looking tan I have been able to acheive from a bottle.</li>
            <li> I just used a rough washcloth and rubbed the heck out of my legs, knees and feet until I was smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> and I had always thought it was pretty decent, even though it was the first tanning cream I used I always stuck with it.</li>
            <li> , pleasant scent and dry time is instant.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something middle of the road that was a decent price and might have better results than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li> mitt is very soft, I think that the brown side works best for rubbing in the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Fake Bake formula does blend very nicely, it does not appear &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; (isn&#x27;t orange, at least on my skin) and it is even (not splotchy).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Other then that I really love this stuff, the smell is really good with little to no self tanner smell afterwards and I have been using this on my face with no breakouts or irritation</li>
            <li> It really has everything I have been looking for: the color is by far the most natural and long-lasting and easy to build on; the scent is very nice, and the DHA does net ever smell super strong as your color develops--and the DHA smell is completely gone once you take your shower;  the product is super easy to apply and very forgiving (I&#x27;m a clutz) and this kit comes with 2 latex gloves to protect your hands and an application mitt that completely and easily gets rid of all streaks; and 2 units of this size bottle lasts me the entire bikini season (which is LONG in Georgia- at least 5 months!); it also works extremely well on my face without causing any breakouts (Just use it more sparingly on your face.</li>
            <li> It by far had the best color I had ever used, but was somewhat difficult and time consuming to get right.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and definitely gives you a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice at first, but after a while smells a little.  </li>
            <li> Use this one day before you want full color (although some color appears immediately and a little more within an hour).</li>
            <li> no need for a gradual tan unless you wana be super dark, one coat is good enough.</li>
            <li> Comes out like new and allows you to continually apply the smoothest streak/splotch free tan every time, even with an old mitt!</li>
            <li> Overall Fake Bake Flawless has even coverage, is easy to use and has decent color payoff.</li>
            <li> i spent my 20&#x27;s getting as much sun as possible, but it seems like more and more people I know are getting skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> I only prefer the high end products, they just tend to be better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame, since I don&#x27;t have much need to look tan for only three days every two weeks and going from fair to tan to fair rapidly looks weird.</li>
            <li> It will probably last me a month,  the other that I use would last about 2 weeks which I had to keep applying every day, which did not smell good !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, the tan lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly like my skin would normally turn after tanning!</li>
            <li> FB is significantly changes my skin tone for the better, but it doesn&#x60;t last for me for a week - unless you don&#x27;t use shower regularly every day,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was totally worth it and as a fairly new mom this is just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazingly tropical and never turns into that yucky typical self tanner</li>
            <li> Not messy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> but I just make sure to apply in shower after i dry off and then wash my hands thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I do lotion up with Lubriderm and make sure Im dry before applying.</li>
            <li> I make sure to rinse out the applicator mitt every time I use it and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> Very decent product.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the application easy</li>
            <li> But I left it on for 6 hours than took a shower and all of the dark washed off leaving me with a great color.   </li>
            <li> NO orange, NO streaking, go as dark as you like, doesn&#x27;t wash off for several days, smells great</li>
            <li> and I leave it sit out on top of my bottle to air dry.</li>
            <li> And it fades far to quickly.</li>
            <li> Itis as easy as drying your skin off with a towel, only you&#x27;re applying tan.</li>
            <li> Definitely idiot-proof and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hey this stuff works great and unlike some I have seen leaving white and dark streaks</li>
            <li> if i don&#x27;t use mass amounts of lotion; i still put lotion on, which seemed to even the bronzer out that would&#x27;ve been washed off if i had chosen to shower, and the blotchy pieces of dry skin blended in more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously if you have dry skin, expect to look a bit blotchy after showering or exfoliating, but I&#x27;ve been able to remedy that by popping a bit tanner into my lotion that I use post-shower when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> Before applying this, be sure to rub some lotion on any dry areas..</li>
            <li> It is easy to see why this product has such rave reviews.</li>
            <li> The color is very realistic as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my entire body, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Very realistic and buildable color.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I used artificial tan, but it turned out flawless.</li>
            <li> Terrific product, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure dry skin areas are moisturized.  </li>
            <li> a medium skinned gal who tans easily but for some mysterious reason my legs take forever to darken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tans quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I watched several YouTube videos of how to apply and it was easy.</li>
            <li> and I burn easily when I&#x27;m outside but never seem to get tan.</li>
            <li> I burn easily when I&#x27;m out in the sun and living in the deep South</li>
            <li> (make sure you let the product dry a bit before putting on your clothes).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such an easy application</li>
            <li> Not orange, not medium or dark brown, but a smooth radiant light tan glow.</li>
            <li> make sure to let it dry all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> It is easier and less greasy to apply and the glove is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> (I have all white sheets in my bed and no stains!!!), and streaks are fairly easily avoided.</li>
            <li> I spray it directly on my skin and then quickly rub it in with the mit.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have dry patches that will absorb more of the tanning product then the rest of your skin.</li>
            <li> I will use a blowdryer on my body to make sure I&#x27;m thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> The mitten will last longer, and this is an easy way to also wash the product off your hands.</li>
            <li> This goes on pretty light but definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> It goes on SO easy, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, or gross !</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, especially with the included mitt, literally takes 5 minutes out of your day.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d just apply more when it was dry and see if it would even out.</li>
            <li> it dries very quickly and i havent noticed any on my clothing from last night or today.</li>
            <li> I had no streaks at all, make sure you don&#x27;t get wet or sweat within the first couple hours of using it</li>
            <li> My acne and dry skin has gotten better but for the life of me I can&#x27;t get even 2 shades darker from tanning.</li>
            <li> The smell is also nice- doesn&#x27;t stink like typical self tanners.</li>
            <li> No streaks, drys quickly, and natural color.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to always exfoliate and dry your legs before you apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no drying time necessary.</li>
            <li> I am on medication that makes me super sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> Make sure you do not have dry skin before application otherwise the &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34;  will turn darker.</li>
            <li> Also make sure it&#x27;s dry before getting in bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin as well</li>
            <li> The smell is okay not terrible but not necessarily good either....</li>
            <li> However, it may seem like the application is easy enough, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> (very realistic tan/ not orange at all)</li>
            <li> As I rubbed it on, it went on smoothly, but where it first touched my skin, it left a splotchy mark that I couldn&#x27;t get evened out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After smoothing it on as evenly as I could, it was dry as most people have stated, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> the color is natural and it dries quickly</li>
            <li> Within a day my face is back to the normal tone, so I have to add more.</li>
            <li> It has a great deep dark color, it applies evenly depending on how well you exfoliate your skin etc.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> However, since you rinse this kind off after you apply it, I&#x27;ve noticed it comes off on the clothes a lot less than others do.</li>
            <li> This product has really good color but does not last long (3-4 days).</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product, but I don&#x27;t know if it is much better than the Banana Boat Summer Color self tanning lotion that you can find for half the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li> It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and most importantly: it gives you a beautiful (not orange) tan.</li>
            <li> sure that you have smooth skin when applying- shave and make sure you are careful around the eyebrows, or if you have facial hair take care of it a couple day earlier;&lt;br /&gt;Practice and accept the possible results!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but it was so messy and was all over my clothes until I took that first shower.</li>
            <li> I am very fair completed &amp; have used this 5 out of the past 6 nights but still don&#x27;t have the golden tan on my legs that I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white as a ghost by this April and have to fly down to Miami for a bachelorette weekend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, the second ingredient, Dimethyl Isosorbide, is an extremely great ingredient used in the cosmetics industry because it breaks down surface fat molecules and &amp;#34;hitches a ride&amp;#34; into the living layers of the skin, carrying with it whatever molecule the manufacturer has bound to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color guard in combination with the mitt makes sure I get every single square inch of my body, no streaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to risk it on my face in case it accentuates any large pores.</li>
            <li> A large portion of it does wash off every time you shower</li>
            <li> I worked at a large chain tanning salon</li>
            <li> if you get sweaty with it on, it will come off on your clothes for certain.</li>
            <li> Would collect in certain areAs.</li>
            <li> Be smart with what will cause sweat WITH FRICTION.</li>
            <li> certain areas lighter and/or darker</li>
            <li> It certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> or when I wear certain tan-only colors</li>
            <li> I feel like I was really misled by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person, but this still gave me a good color without looking overly tan.</li>
            <li> As a naturally very pale person, I&#x27;m always looking for a good self tanner.</li>
            <li> I have moderately pale skin, I can tan in the summers but never get extremely dark, and this color comes out perfectly on me.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to self tanner!!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m a new faithful!!</li>
            <li> Ok first the negative it does have a tanning smell about 4 hours into it and once rinsed off its light</li>
            <li> Has a great natural color, buildable, doesn&#x27;t fade weird (hardly actually), and so quick and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product, it just makes a mess in my shower area but</li>
            <li> I even think the color is better than any spray-tan I&#x27;ve had in past, more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time fake tanner with fair to light skin.</li>
            <li> and it eventually came off unevenly and made my skin look even more splotchy!</li>
            <li> This is not my first fake tanner-  but by far the best.</li>
            <li> and I still have a few more applications to go!  </li>
            <li> The color is so natural and no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great as far as not staining clothes, but a little tricky when you&#x27;re new to applying.</li>
            <li> great going on, but next day before shower I detected some odd scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, you get instant color and about half of it stays after a shower.</li>
            <li> The whole process took less time than it would have taken to drive to the tanning salon and get a spray tan, and I did it in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li> Works really nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to put it on, dry and go to bed without worry about it coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product on my legs because I wanted to make sure I got the technique down before I moved to more visible areas of my body.  </li>
            <li> The mitt makes applying this soo fast and easy, especially once you&#x27;ve already done it before.</li>
            <li> It dried in minutes, and I was able to dress quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick fake tan.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that fake tanner stench, no streaks, easy to use, and good color.</li>
            <li> I suppose it does if you use the stuff, but wash it out, place it over the bottle to dry, it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.</li>
            <li> Third, I have to put on so much because the spray does not spread easily.</li>
            <li> Used to spending wayyy too much time in a tanning bed (lay down AND stand up in same session) to achieve a great tan.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands, both high and low end, and this is the easiest to apply and most natural looking of them all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on very smoothly with absolutely no</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first since self tanner is a scary thing, but it really did go on flawlessly and looked totally natural.</li>
            <li> sprayed the mitt once or twice and began rubbing in very light circles, moving from one area to another while applying harder pressure as the wet/dampness wore off.</li>
            <li> : This is my personal step that really helps me as an extremely pale person get a beautiful, even, brown tan.</li>
            <li> good tip that I found if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you get your back is to spray some of the tanning liquid onto a dark rag/towel and as if you were drying your back off, with one hand hold the top of the towel and one hand hold the bottom, wiping the towel across your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray dried in seconds and leaves a very pleasant smell (considering some of the other ones out there).</li>
            <li> It is a good product and went on very easily, no streaks, and not orange at all.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d rather use the NEW Jergens glow which is completely unscented and achieves a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with the mitt and it has held up fine after numerous applications.</li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive brand from Sephora; Dior, Clinique, St. Tropez and this is the best one by far!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to moisturize dry spots!</li>
            <li> keep it in a cool shelf away from heat and light, where i keep all my other liquid products and lotions without a problem for years.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless saves me nearly $60 a month!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother with &amp;#34;blending lotion&amp;#34;, regular lotion worked just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sticky at all, sinks in super fast, and a light tropical scent.</li>
            <li> And though the company does make a specific product for the face, I used the body tanner and it was totally fine.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li> She has purchased this twice and the look is pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> If you can get it on even the first time, it does have a decent color, but it is a pain to work</li>
            <li> The product also has a decent scent!  </li>
            <li> I would likely buy this again for a quick tanner!</li>
            <li> At this point, I had very high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> It is a very high quality, there are no streaks.</li>
            <li> The mitt that comes with it is also very high quality.</li>
            <li> I think all self-tanners do to a certain extent, but this will straight turn your sheets</li>
            <li> I guess its really my fault for having large pores, but still I took a star off my rating for that reason.</li>
            <li> I have tried other self tanners and this one is my favorite by far!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it also gives a slight tan right after using it, so if you feel like you need a tan</li>
            <li> , little do they know my AMAZING tan comes out of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> the mit that comes with it for application kind of sheds a little.</li>
            <li> applied at night went to bed and woke up nice and dark !</li>
            <li> Especially in the traditional places where the lotions sink in too much and create the ever lovely bread-crust effect on the edges of the palms, between the fingers, nail beds, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the feet!</li>
            <li> The following night, I applied another and that made me kind of orange, so just as a fair warning, if you are super pale, you might come out a little orange.</li>
            <li> I am SUPER pale and it gives me a nice natural tan without all of the damage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to see where you apply it because the colorguard is super dark.  </li>
            <li> Even better is, it did not rub off a single bit on to my clothing!</li>
            <li> but works very good and doesn&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and have a difficult time finding a self-tanner than doesn&#x27;t look orangy and rusty.  </li>
            <li> The applicator sponge is a real pain to use, unless you are doing large area&#x27;s or your whole body, but for my face, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I get the best results when I exfoliate for a few days before using it &amp; the day of, then use it after taking a shower in the evening &amp; putting on NO lotions or anything [except for a little argan oil or something like that on my elbows, knees, ankles and face].</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self tanning products in the past and I can honestly say this one gives the most realistic color of all of them.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit to apply the first time trying to make even, but overall amazing!</li>
            <li> Looks very natural!!  </li>
            <li> With other products, the smell was so strong that it lingered even after showering- not in a powerful way</li>
            <li> my overall body was pretty good not going to lie, but areas like your feet hands knees are super tricky and give the FAKE tan away so easily.</li>
            <li> Okay, usually self tanner is something I would use for special occasions or weekends I wanted to wear shorts.  </li>
            <li> And definitely not orange or muddy looking, but a beautiful slightly darker than your natural shade tan!  </li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased with the ease of the application process, how quickly it dries and though the tan is not intensely dark, it does look natural</li>
            <li> My excitement was so high for this product to only go down more and more as I use the product.</li>
            <li> Have spent $100 and this looks so much more real.</li>
            <li> I also lightly apply an \\&quot;in shower\\&quot; body lotion or oil such as Alph Keri and gently rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I hope the instructions are accurate because it says I only have to apply once a week to keep this tan.  </li>
            <li> By far the best fake tanning solution I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product had amazing reviews, so I figured that many people couldn&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> It goes on really even, and the mitt smoothes nicely to avoid any harsh, discolored areas.  </li>
            <li> Works great but only feels like the tan stays for a few days instead of a &amp;#34;week&amp;#34; as the box says</li>
            <li> and you can see a huge difference with just one application as my stomach was snow white</li>
            <li> My legs have that pasty &#x27;dead fish, belly up white&#x27;, LOL.  </li>
            <li> This has great lasting power, and my bottle lasted me around 2 months with heavy use.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fake tanning product I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I love fake bake products and this was an amazing price for this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product was how light it was.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely get a full body spray tan with it, the bottle lasts for a really long time to which is a big plus :) Enjoy</li>
            <li> , I think this is a terrific product and really enjoy the whole line that FakeBake has.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is very buildable, so you can get a light tan or a really deep one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this albino Momma is a HUGE fan of this product and will definitely continue to purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I still really like the results though, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The picture is very misleading as it shows in the picture a spray nozzle on a purple bottle.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m ready to put on a skirt and head out the door.</li>
            <li> This looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Thanks Glenis.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews that stated the gloves that came with it were very flimsy</li>
            <li> An absolute steal</li>
            <li> She is also very slender</li>
            <li> My tan looked a lot better than some of my friend&#x27;s professional spray tans (which cost so much more!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this correctly is key.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have light spots, especially don&#x27;t sweat or there will be brown rain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> With potential problem areas of the knees and elbows a LIGHT application of baby oil works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I have never used a self tanner before and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect</li>
            <li> I was intrigued on trying this out, I happened to find this product out on amazon, by accident really</li>
            <li> This stuff fades really fast.</li>
            <li> , I was hoping for a burst of fruitness or something really tropical</li>
            <li> You have to really put it on 4 days in a row and</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t get splotchy.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> , I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li> My legs never got much color at all.</li>
            <li> Ive really tried every self tanner, creams, gels, lotions, sprays.  </li>
            <li> And reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> It really has everything you hope for in a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t stand out as much in the summer.</li>
            <li> I only use the mit after applying to smooth around ankles and elbows, because I feel like mits end up rubbing off 1/2 of your self tanner</li>
            <li> but this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely re-order</li>
            <li> Oh and I like this much more compared to aerosol sprays because you have to be so careful not to spray them all over the walls.  </li>
            <li> This pump is much easier.  </li>
            <li> My suggestions would be to definitely do it a night, exfoliate before applying, and mostly importantly, take your time when applying this.</li>
            <li> My tan always looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It gives a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; tan.</li>
            <li> but for the price, you really just can&#x27;t beat this bottle....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much sun in a year</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with a very stained hand.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try it, but they were selling it for almost $30.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic tanning product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me orange and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Just blend it in very well and DO NOT RUSH THE PROCESS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking people who say it&#x27;s orange are using too much and not spreading it well.</li>
            <li> and I was referred to use this by a pageant girl who models for Modern Vintage Boutique.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> So I was caught and had to tell him what it was haha as soon as we got home from running errands</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I apply a light coat daily until I get the tan I want.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After exfoliating with a coarse sugar scrub, I applied lotion lightly to my elbows, ankles, toes, knees (</li>
            <li> I am a very fair-skinned redhead with some freckling.</li>
            <li> (I really went for it and put it ALL over).</li>
            <li> I really like the &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Blended really well</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Thanks again...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much at once.</li>
            <li> Consistency is very water-like.  </li>
            <li> I DO have more color, just not much on my legs.</li>
            <li> I applied this Monday and didn&#x27;t really need to reapply tonight (Friday) but</li>
            <li> By the reviews I expected this to be better than the drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I did my homework and tried to read as much about how to apply and which ones claim to do the job without making you orange and stinky.</li>
            <li> I use this everywhere, my whole body, hands, feet, and my face as well.</li>
            <li> really its because of this product</li>
            <li> I think the mitt is the real clincher here though.</li>
            <li> I keep looking at my tan bod because I am amazed at how real it looks.</li>
            <li> It gave a really great color, but the spray got all over my floor and cabinets, it was horrible, I went back to the orignial and am very happy.</li>
            <li> you will get a golden, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> put on the gloves and shake the bottle very well.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that wants a tan without the damage!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin imperfections still show through but would with a real tan too.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The mitt makes the application very even and prevents my palms form staining.</li>
            <li> The day it arrived, I showered &amp; exfoliated my whole body.</li>
            <li> , it absolutely does not rub off on clothing etc.  </li>
            <li> It came out very even</li>
            <li> and I was done my whole body in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> No streaking and dries fast.</li>
            <li> but I have a very yellowy-green olive complexion...</li>
            <li> This (both with 1 then 2 applications ) looks fairly natural and golden not orange.</li>
            <li> It looks like a real tan</li>
            <li> I really prefer the lotion because it gets me a darker color.  </li>
            <li> But I like how it dries so fast</li>
            <li> So my wife decided to try it and it has turn out very well for her.</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> I had spray tanned at a salon, but it never compared to the real thing, so</li>
            <li> Use sparingly when squirting it out on the mit, it comes out in an amount which was way too much to use at once.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> Just enough to cover light flaws.</li>
            <li> I expected to use it more</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on my skin</li>
            <li> I feel as though it worked with my skin tone and blended really well.</li>
            <li> how much is needed to evenly distribute onto my whole body.</li>
            <li> But it also fades very evenly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very affordable price.</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1 for the foot, ankle, knee and back of knee lightly.</li>
            <li> the easier it is to spread around and blend like as in spraying your whole arm, not just your forearm.</li>
            <li> The sun always burns me no matter how much sunscreen I lather on myself.</li>
            <li> I normally just use those scrubbing gloves and it all works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Even though it was fast drying (which means you need to work relatively fast) a lot of the color comes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> They exchanged it no problem (thanks amazon)</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> this is something that you cant put on fast, you need to evenly put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a light tan left on my arms and legs and haven&#x27;t used it in over a week.</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t diss it too much.</li>
            <li> This is a much healthier option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t really absorb, but that the liquid stays on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> As a recovered serial tanner, then serial spray tanner, I have to say I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very sunkissed.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than a spray, and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house and get sticky and stinky for a while</li>
            <li> The spray bottle makes applying this so much easier.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This combination works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> As the tan develops the smell will come through, but I don&#x27;t really notice it unless I sniff my arm.</li>
            <li> ) Wash the mitt gently with soap and water after each application.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> I really like the spray.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the spray over a gel, liquid or mousse because the spray really soaks in to your skin.</li>
            <li> Can really make some mistakes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It puts such a light color on you that it&#x27;s not even noticeable.</li>
            <li> The color was  very faded and spotty</li>
            <li> (No matter how much exfoliation, it comes off patchy in these areas).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need to &amp;#34;review&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> very quickly&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product will probably purchase again</li>
            <li> This stuff does work really well for what it is.</li>
            <li> Also MUST exfoliate well beforehand, otherwise it looks very splotchy.</li>
            <li> I can get out of the shower, apply oil to my elbows, then put this on and get ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using this product before bed, but really, there&#x27;s no reason to.</li>
            <li> I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Secondly but equally as important, NO orange.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The problem with the spray on tan was you had no way of telling how much coverage you had.</li>
            <li> very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Shows a real tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 4 hours I could really see the tan.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I used too much product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> VERY embarrassing...</li>
            <li> The bronzer really does help you to see where you are putting it on, and how much.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and the mitt works very well at evening things out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention it dries insanely fast during application, which is always a plus in my book&lt;</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on self tanners.</li>
            <li> and I seemed really orange-y.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I  really like the color this stuff leaves</li>
            <li> Give it a shot for real.</li>
            <li> MAYBE I NEED A VERY MUISTURIZING BODY CREAM.</li>
            <li> I could not use this on my face as it very drying and got streaky.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If I were simply just hanging out on the beach, it&#x27;s fantastic for giving that tan without the sun damage.</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> but I recently was diagnosed with skin cancer and had to stop tanning in the UV light.</li>
            <li> I also moisturize my skin very well though.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this</li>
            <li> so I got really go results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend to much time in the sun</li>
            <li> It also is VERY blotchy..</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Because it will absorb into your skin so fast, and you use twice as much.</li>
            <li> So much, I almost wrote this review</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really tan you either.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use because I really did NOT want to be orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the time for real sun (not to mention the damaging rays) or the money for a spray tan.</li>
            <li> It was very orange.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much self tanner</li>
            <li> but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> Then applied this to my whole body, face included.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You build the color each day, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too intense.</li>
            <li> You have to work fast with the mitt, because the product dries rapidly.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on you&#x27;ll notice your pours are darker than normal.</li>
            <li> , it looks like a real tan &amp; I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Dries really fast so no rubbing off on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
            <li> I have tried lotions that really had me scared of self tanners</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> I wanted to quit wearing pantyhose with dresses and feel comfortable wearing shorts in public.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated before applying and really tried to rub it on evenly.  </li>
            <li> It really soaked into some parts of my legs but not others.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do that</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no streaks and instant color.</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> It makes the application process simple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Tan looks real and not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I really like fakebake.</li>
            <li> It tends to come off even after I waited a whole day (or couple.)</li>
            <li> it helps you get it on very evenly.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have never used a self-tan/sunless tanner before because I feared looking like an orange, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Also do not wear it under light or white clothes.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and doesnt get all over!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> This dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Love this product... works great and does NOT look yellow or fake...</li>
            <li> I really like the mitt</li>
            <li> AT ALL, no matter how much I exfoliate and moisturize afterwards,  I still end up very blotchy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the colour that shows on my skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend people try it!</li>
            <li> I really like how the color looks</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leak THAT much</li>
            <li> Seems like a much safer alternative to going out in the sun and the color of my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> really looks like you went to the islands and sunbathed for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instant results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> Too much money and effort to go through for no visable color change.</li>
            <li> then apply lotion to my whole body( Olay)&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> Get put of shower and lotion up your whole body.</li>
            <li> That tells me it looks real, not orange and cakey.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li> looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and isn&#x27;t tacky.  </li>
            <li> and I got very tan.</li>
            <li> When it starts to fade in the creases of your arms and around your neck it looks very splotchy.</li>
            <li> it will run, which really bothered me.</li>
            <li> It goes on very well.</li>
            <li> It also is very orange.</li>
            <li> To much orange tint.</li>
            <li> DHA, the tanning agent in products like this is in and of itself NOT HARMFUL really if your not bringing it into your lungs.</li>
            <li> So I took a shower that night, and exfoliated very well, like you are supposed to</li>
            <li> Also, if you use this stuff on your hands/feet, do so very sparingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a porcelain skinned redhead and this product didn&#x27;t deliver much of a tan.</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the mitt that comes with it as well.</li>
            <li> All in all, I will keep using it, until I can get some real sun.</li>
            <li> It is important to keep skin regularly moisturized while using this though.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t that much work anyway.</li>
            <li> I refuse to damage and ruin the youthful lipids from UV rays, but I really like a \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; glow form a tan.</li>
            <li> and i want my face as tan as my body without having to color in my whole face and neck with makeup and look all cakey.</li>
            <li> The color guide really does help you see where it went, and also looks passable as a tan until your tan develops.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> The gloves and the mitt really make a difference in the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li> This stuff looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real brown tint.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t give me much of a tan, and what it did give me would fade in about four days.</li>
            <li> Once it washes off it doesnt leave as much tan as I would like</li>
            <li> if you keep re-applying too much.</li>
            <li> It will really transfers onto sheets, but has always washed out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast so</li>
            <li> There are those that say the mitt uses up too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> so you can really tell where you have applied.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell (coconut).</li>
            <li> my package got here so fast.</li>
            <li> but I already know I&#x27;m going to buy another one here real soon</li>
            <li> Be careful around your arms if you&#x27;re like me and tend to have tanner arms on the top of your forearm and paler skin on the bottom part of your arm/the inside crease of your elbow.</li>
            <li> and you really can&#x27;t do anything that night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not apply too much pressure when rubbing it in the the mitt.</li>
            <li> As for the Fake Bake its amazing, light fresh smell not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> : If you mix in your hands with a body lotion it makes the application THAT much faster and longer</li>
            <li> The amount you put on is what color it turns our to be, it doesnt get much drker as the day goes on, shake up the bottle before use and cut the stem on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is much thinner in consistency</li>
            <li> Also when you stop the tanning treatments and it wears off, it came off much like too-tan skin; flaky and patchy</li>
            <li> its dries so fast.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t rub off on any of my clothes, which is pretty remarkable, considering I actually sprayed some on my arms and back, put on white silk pajamas and went to sleep, and nothing came off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute sh!t.</li>
            <li> It looks real.</li>
            <li> almost white in the winter; but in the summer, I am capable of getting a nice medium deep tan.  </li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with this product.</li>
            <li> It wants to slip off during application.</li>
            <li> It works, it really works...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The color is natural and golden looking and does increase with time and applications.</li>
            <li> I really have to use something on my legs in the summer</li>
            <li> and I really looked like I had a real</li>
            <li> and everyone thought we had real tans from baking on the beach.  </li>
            <li> It smells very tropical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this self tanner.  </li>
            <li> It would take maybe 4 days of application to really see a change</li>
            <li> You need to exfoliate really well to get it all off.</li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t really like, I wish it just didn&#x27;t smell at all, so I&#x27;d suggest showering before hanging out with anyone.</li>
            <li> this looks better than any spray tan ive ever had, it looks like i&#x27;ve spent a week on vacay!it</li>
            <li> I dont like how if you put too much on in one place it will be blachy</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re really supposed to drench the thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I:&lt;br /&gt; -exfoliated very well</li>
            <li> , I can now get a natural golden tan without the damage of the sun or tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff washes off to fast</li>
            <li> It goes on well and looks real.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> After which, is still smells but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t do much to keep it on like moisturize or refrain from shaving.</li>
            <li> The mitt that comes with it does need to be washed every couple times you use it, but it washes up really well.  </li>
            <li> The product was delivered very promptly and as stated.</li>
            <li> But how natural looking it does look is so worth over-looking that con.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It dried really fast and instantly looks great.</li>
            <li> so I embarrassingly have, for lack of a better word, crevices, where I had a bit of trouble applying, but ultimately was able to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it looks really streaky when I applied it.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like a self tanner, instead it is very tropical smelling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> Really helps apply an even color</li>
            <li> Which i dont really see any color come off when i rinse.  </li>
            <li> highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and some of the girls asked if I spent money on a tanning salon spray tan.</li>
            <li> He would never have had me put it on if it didn&#x27;t look real.  </li>
            <li> Mine always washes off, but again, I do like to really exfoliate my body and moisturize my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> It builds very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries amazingly fast and I haven&#x27;t noticed any on my clothing or sheets.</li>
            <li> extra light when you rub across feet, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!nner.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> People think it&#x27;s a real tan on me.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY use a plastic glove under the mitt.</li>
            <li> It really does glow.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color, it is a bit intense though especially if you are wintertime white, it wasn&#x27;t orange</li>
            <li> my real sun tan</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> It works really well not to turn you orange while giving you a tan gradually</li>
            <li> Not too much of the color came off.  </li>
            <li> I really like the result from this tanner, doesn&#x27;t fade patchy</li>
            <li> It really needs a wrist banding sewed onto the mitt to keep it from pulling off.</li>
            <li> the mit makes it very convenient, but i did forget to wear the rubber gloves they provide with it</li>
            <li> I have purchased every brand from the very highest end to the lowest.</li>
            <li> Going into it I was VERY scared of turning really orange, messing up, etc.</li>
            <li> I would not spray much on, if I wanted a bronzed look</li>
            <li> This was so much better than I expected having never used a self tanner.</li>
            <li> It is now May 13, and I&#x27;m getting ready to order again to carry us thru summer.</li>
            <li> did watch some videos on how to apply it which were really helpful for getting even color and to avoid streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was home all day because by the time I was ready to take a shower, I stank.</li>
            <li> It is fast drying, and the \\&quot;color\\&quot; won&#x27;t rub off on stuff while you sleep...</li>
            <li> after i scrubbed those babies, my over all tan looked real.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of sunless tanners over the years and was really looking forward to trying this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> (I used it primarily to add color to my upper arms to eliminate a semi-farmers tan).</li>
            <li> stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li> I decided I don&#x27;t like this product so much after all...</li>
            <li> It made me an orangeish color and was very splotchy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> One application doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> hand mit is really helpful to prevent streaking.</li>
            <li> Will make knees and ankles orange if you get too much product on them.  </li>
            <li> You Have To Find Out How Much You Need To Apply For Yourself To Get The Tan You Want .</li>
            <li> In Conclusion , I Really Recommend This Product .</li>
            <li> What really sealed the deal for me with this product is the way it fades.  </li>
            <li> if you get too much to can wash it off &amp; start over.</li>
            <li> FAST</li>
            <li> I used a sea sponge loofah and some sugar scrub I made to exfoliate everywhere, really focusing on my knees, elbows, ankles, hands and feet.</li>
            <li> The mitt doesn&#x27;t stay on my hand very well</li>
            <li> It has saved me so much money (from getting air brush tans)</li>
            <li> I really think that makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li> but then I had another friend tell me that I was getting really tan</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Dries fast, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It looks like a REAL TAN.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tanning liquid!</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to apply than the one I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Works very well on body</li>
            <li> Layers very well.</li>
            <li> ...glow in the light white, if I may.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when I use this, and it looks really natural...even for me.</li>
            <li> Not orange and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast; it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have any on.</li>
            <li> use it after showering before bed, Do not apply too much stay on the lighter side.</li>
            <li> I really like this product-</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice product for me who does not have time to spend hours tanning but wants to go outside with friends and not have that totally white glow.  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with 2 protective latex gloves, to protect your hands from absorbing to much color, and it also includes an application mitt.  </li>
            <li> If they would attach elastic around the bottom, it would stay on your wrist better, instead of slipping off.  </li>
            <li> This goes on evenly, activates and dries fast, and has NO SMELL.</li>
            <li> (because this stuff dries fast) using the rubber gloves that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I applied the tanner to my whole body, boobs and all, I&#x27;m also a breast feeding mother who co sleeps with my baby.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also very buildable</li>
            <li> The glove that comes with it works very well too.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I used it gently on my face,  hands, elbows , knees.. and just took my time</li>
            <li> For me, it took a lot of coats to really make a difference, but with that said...</li>
            <li> Took me three applications to get the color I wanted on my legs that matched to the real tan</li>
            <li> Has to be to be very evenly put on</li>
            <li> inside of elbow) fade much quicker than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> really getting a tan!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If you put to much on, don&#x27;t worry too much, you can get some of it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Another downside with the mitt is even if you exfoliate really well</li>
            <li> and it looks real.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast too</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to get into this whole Snookie thing.  </li>
            <li> The tan is extreamly even as well as real looking.</li>
            <li> Just have to make sure not to get wet went</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan...not orange.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so much darker</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this stuff really works..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so dont use to much or</li>
            <li> it looks really streaky.</li>
            <li> banana boat just didn&#x27;t really tan very well at all.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how much that matters, but seems reasonable</li>
            <li> The mit really helps and the spray on.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS TANNER..</li>
            <li> and it really took the pasty-ness away.  </li>
            <li> so I will by from amazon again and again thanks</li>
            <li> DO NOT listen to people saying it doesn&#x27;t wash off immediately because it absolutely does.</li>
            <li> It looks like a real tan; not some Jersey Shore Oompa Loompa monstrosity.</li>
            <li> Could I have rubbed it too much and some of the product rubbed off perhaps??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And highly recommend !</li>
            <li> but the night after I feel much lighter.</li>
            <li> Liquid tanner in a squeeze tube is kind of a mess, and I&#x27;m sure that is why the other products didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> Much darker color than Moist Hemp Bronzing lotion alone.</li>
            <li> to apply&lt;br /&gt;Looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the pump, and in fact you really dont need to use the pump</li>
            <li> The stuff just looks real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I still do really like this product, but I had to take a star away.  </li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> really though...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t risk having too much on your hands because this is a fast drying product (and trust me</li>
            <li> I tend to get a bit antsy and go too fast over my thighs, but that&#x27;s how you can miss a spot...</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When washing your mitt: I use a gentle shampoo to wash it out, and truly scrub it.</li>
            <li> I was a tad afraid to try it, but it worked great!</li>
            <li> Very tropical.</li>
            <li> I really like the application method.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting to the point where it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to keep it up.</li>
            <li> but after showering you have to really look to see it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand how it can fade that much after one wash.</li>
            <li> :/showering you have to really look to see it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand how it can fade that much after one wash.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot</li>
            <li> They never came out even or looked real..</li>
            <li> even the darkest formula didn&#x27;t really build up much color on my skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve battled with the orange thing my whole life.</li>
            <li> I realized that somehow the liquid came out of the bottle &amp; the brown liquid seeped through the bag and completely ruined over $250 worth of clothing &amp;</li>
            <li> you really cant screw up the application unless you just dont wipe that spot...</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> Also it dries so fast because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li> of my absolute favourite things is that it doesn&#x27;t smell AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried a tanner that didn&#x27;t immediately give off that metallic funk that hung around you until you showered later, even if they promised they were odor free.  </li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this product for all complexions.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t end up looking too bronze, either, which I appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I used a light coating of massage oil on my hands, elbows, and knees prior to applying.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> but after an hour or two, ended up looking much lighter.</li>
            <li> The provided glove makes the application so much faster and even.</li>
            <li> With the guide this is the fastest self tanner I have found that provides a very even look.</li>
            <li> i really like this self tanner.</li>
            <li> ,THEY MUST BE PUTTING ON  TO MUCH?</li>
            <li> BUT AGAIN I DIDNT USE TO MUCH</li>
            <li> Drys fast.</li>
            <li> when really it was just one application i applied</li>
            <li> I appreciated that the seller was so prompt in sending the order.  </li>
            <li> It applies very well and after drying and letting it soak into my skin it was not streaky at all.</li>
            <li> From the very high-end to the drugstore brand</li>
            <li> It keeps it from absorbing too much into your skin and making it look dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Spray straight on the skin</li>
            <li> It really is all about trial and error.</li>
            <li> I of course didn&#x27;t really understand until I got the bottle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend really exfoliating your skin before applying so</li>
            <li> And it really stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buff lightly onto feet and hands using the buffing mitt only.  </li>
            <li> Haha)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but the tan really evened itself out over night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to get out in the sun (nor do i really want to fry myself)</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it fades out waiting a whole week to reapply.</li>
            <li> After not using it for two days a green ring appeared on the brown mitt and it kind of freaked me out.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far and am pleased with the color it provided</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a natural looking fade or last more than 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I LOVE the sun and love being tan, but as we all know, it&#x27;s not great for the skin.</li>
            <li> its ok, I have used some that are way better and some that are way worse.</li>
            <li> I spray it at night, I take a shower the next day to make sure my tan has developed and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> and I was still left with a nicely tanned naked bod.  </li>
            <li> The Fake Bake product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> on nice and even and doesn&#x27;t look fake, it looks like a nice natural tan.</li>
            <li> I applied an hour before bed and found the smell from it on my face overwhelming (I&#x27;m sensitive to odors) and had to get up in the middle of the night to shower.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> I have had people comment on my nice color a few times since I started using this.</li>
            <li> The color is okay, I guess, but it&#x27;s obvious that it isn&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li> like I had some kind of skin disease for a few weeks before it was all gone.</li>
            <li> It seems to rinse off when you shower or bathe so to actually keep a nice glow you have to do it often, if not daily.</li>
            <li> I have used many self-tanners before such as L&#x27;oreal sublime, Jergens Natural Glow, Tan-Towels, Clinique brands, etc.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and the smell is tolerable, but when it started to fade, it looked like dirt on my skin, especially around my feet and inner part of my arms.</li>
            <li> I liked the Fake &amp; Bake lotion better than the spray option, but this product does work well.</li>
            <li> I have never had anyone make a negative remark about the color, all I hear is about how good</li>
            <li> actually gave my 1/4 full bottle to somebody who was interested in trying it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice, even color and makes me not look so dead.</li>
            <li> The mitt is handy for application - that also comes with a few gloves to wear underneath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a stain, leaked all over destroying a nice 32.00 shirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in skin protection while still having a nice sunkissed glow</li>
            <li> After trying several self-tanners, this is by far, the most tolerable.</li>
            <li> I honestly think the tan with Fake Bake looks better than the tan I get from sun/tanning bed.</li>
            <li> just you (which is a good thing, at least in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I recommend doing it right after your shower, use Pure &amp; Natural soap</li>
            <li> I put it on last night and instantly had a nice tan</li>
            <li> Maybe if they had a different kind of mitt to apply it with...say with fingers and different material...</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless gives you a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> which is nice, but again it is messy.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is, by far, the best.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake works well and gives you a nice, healthy tan.  </li>
            <li> ,Such a nice thing to hear when before I felt embarrassed of my white legs.</li>
            <li> I prefer creating my own Fake Bake tan rather than paying for a spray tan; I received better results.</li>
            <li> I have never really been able to use a self tanner due to my skin being dry, but this stuff is outstanding!!</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not oily, it dries fast, and the color is great even for such pale skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> I use the fake bake flawless at night right before bed after I have already brushed my teeth and done anything else that I need to do that requires using water.</li>
            <li> Not only is it super easy to apply, but the color lasts forever, it doesn&#x27;t wash off streaky like other tanners, it smells AMAZING even after it&#x27;s dry, and speaking of drying, I can get dressed immediately after putting this on without having to worry about it coming off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> , i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s super fair skinned only because i am not sure how it&#x27;d react.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> It just takes a few minutes to apply; you&#x27;ll be able to see a tan right away.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m sure mostly everyone knows this, but I learned this the hard way, is to use a scrub before the first application and apply a little bit of lotion on feet, knees and elbows to make the product go on smoothly to those areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the Fake Bake Flawless over the Sungoddess because Sungoddess seems to dry/bunch up when i&#x27;m applying in some areas, but other then that if i&#x27;m careful and rub in good then no problems.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, little smell, dries super fast.</li>
            <li> First off, you want to make sure you exfoliate with a product that does not leave an oily residue because if you use this after that, it dries in an odd mottled coloring, almost like you have a rash or something.</li>
            <li> elbows and knees, tan over them quickly and smoothly -careful not to have a full mit of product when you touch these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick to apply with the mitt, it only takes me about 3 minutes to do my whole body!</li>
            <li> its easy to use and the smell is not bad, but i think u can still smell it after few days , the colour is not orange , i didnt put on me face tho .</li>
            <li> im scared i would mess up, and look funny or not rub in good enough.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it was easy to apply and dried quickly but was way too light even after several applications.</li>
            <li> Mitt fibers started falling out by the end of the first use, so I bought a new one for 10 bucks from another brand</li>
            <li> After my first application I went downstairs without telling my mom that I tried out my new holy grail (we are beauty fanatics and bffs)</li>
            <li> first off guys if your new to this.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake worked great, had a nice smell to it, easy to apply, lasts fairly long (3-4 days unless you apply every other night) and this doesn&#x27;t stain everything.</li>
            <li> but I live in Alaska right now, so my paleness was becoming alarming.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it directly on the mitt and held the sprayer almost right on it to avoid spraying my  surroundings.</li>
            <li> I am over the days of laying in tanning beds, and right now the weather here does not all to get natural sun.</li>
            <li> Even my 10 yr old daughter came in right after and said &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried AT LEAST 5 other self tanners, this is the best  one BY FAR!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply as long as you shave and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Like so many other reviews state, this works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original fake bake and loved everything but the smell...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li> The balm isn&#x27;t cheap (it was originally priced at $90 but dropped to $50 on Amazon a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have used the original Fake Bake and loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Fake Bake lotion and loved it.</li>
            <li> The mitt and gloves provided really help in preventing the streaking and hand-staining that most other sunless tanners cause.</li>
            <li> Other than those avoidable/fixable problems, overall a good product and would recommend.  </li>
            <li> Luckily this self tanner produced and very natural color on my skin, very close to a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the face as splotchy for those people who are older like me who have large pores.</li>
            <li> After exfoliating, I used a few squirts of this (I kept it light for the first application) and I was surprised by how lightly it went on and how well the enclosed glove worked to apply the product evenly.  </li>
            <li> I have very light pale skin naturally with cool undertones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty Irish, and Fake Bake Flawless gives me just the right amount of tan that looks natural and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I apply it to dry skin after a good exfoliation in the shower, give it about 2-3 minutes to completely dry</li>
            <li> or maybe my skin is super dry and absorbed the wetness immediately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally light skinned (European decent)</li>
            <li> You can see very clearly where you are applying, and while this is a liquid, it spread and blended incredibly well, dried amazingly fast, and actually left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I tried this last night after my bath (exfoliated, lotioned my knobby parts, dried myself very well) and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use other self tanners but I love this one ....</li>
            <li> Perfect fake bake with out all the harm of the sun!</li>
            <li> Smell is WAY better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Best fake tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Way better than lotions or other sprays.</li>
            <li> and personally I will only use self-tanners that contain bronzers so that you are clearly able to see exactly where you are applying it.</li>
            <li> so make sure you don&#x27;t have any other self tanners on when applying this.</li>
            <li> it took several days to see a significant tan and to work out any spots where I was heavier or lighter handed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know what I like most, the color or the fact that it doesn&#x27;t sit in your pores on your legs like so many other tanners do, or the other fact that it doesn&#x27;t fade like if you have some sort of disease.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate prior to applying and wash your mitten out in the sink after every use and your golden!</li>
            <li> and I love telling other women</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, none really keep that great bronze post the first shower (but then nor did the $50 salon spray tan either).  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and lingering like some other tanners I have used.</li>
            <li> The following day I noticed that familiar self Tanner smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not beach or water friendly, and tended to run and spot, which led to daily applications at one point.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other spray on tanning formula i have ever used....</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not sticky like many other formulas.</li>
            <li> Way better than the other.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I can not stand the orange color I&#x27;ve gotten from so many other products.</li>
            <li> I have always been on the hunt for a good fake tanner, but up until I found this product I was not able to find one that I was happy with.</li>
            <li> I would say there are two things to be aware of however - the liquid and the mitt require a little more effort in blending than a lotion self-tanner would.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky like most other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Another thing, my mitt started to pill up on the first use and little pieces come off at each use - hopefully this won&#x27;t happen too much more.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold up better then other sunless tanners I use.</li>
            <li> It does smell better than other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very big bottle too so well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> i was concerned the color might look to orange like many other self tanners on the market.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint like many other either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two so far its about time to order again!;)</li>
            <li> Despite many other reviews saying to shower at night, apply, let settle/go to sleep, and shower again in the morning...</li>
            <li> instead you could shower in the morning, apply this stuff, and you would have a deep rich tan that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The smell is much better then other tanners.</li>
            <li> So unless you apply 3 or 4 applications on top of each other which I&#x27;m assuming this reviewer may have done, it will NOT turn you orange.</li>
            <li> : Overall I find this product to be worth every cent!</li>
            <li> am a 28 year old female with pretty light skin (daywalker here).</li>
            <li> I cut a bit more than an inch off of the straw part as recommended in other reviews to prevent the leaking.  </li>
            <li> Smell is better than other drug store brands that I&#x27;ve tried - although there is an eventual tanning product smell after using.</li>
            <li> Most of the other sunless products that I have used, turn my skin a blotchy brown, orange color.</li>
            <li> The best fake tan ever !</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I got several bottles for myself and others.  </li>
            <li> THOUGH like most other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I followed other reviews that said to trim the spray top straw, and there was no leaking whatsoever.</li>
            <li> smell, deep and rich brown (</li>
            <li> Even after applying liberally, within 2 days my skin is back to its original color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am 100% back to my original pallor after a shower.</li>
            <li> The instant brown wears off a little in the shower but you still get a nice glow from the product!  </li>
            <li> You HAVE to make sure that you exfoliate first, and I also used a little bit of baby oil on the rougher areas before applying (ankles, knees, heels, and elbows).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have said, \\&quot;i&#x27;ve tried them all!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but after using Fake Bake Flawless last night, I felt that I absolutely MUST!  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate before I use it &amp; after reading other reviews I trimmed the tip off the spray bottle so it has never leaked from the top as have been some reviewers complaints.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice dark glow that actually looks real, and appears right away.</li>
            <li> I suspect this method reduces the amount of product absorbed into my skin, which in turn shortens the life of my fake tan, but it makes application so fast and easy that I don&#x27;t mind having to do it more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale naturally--really got this more to hide the veins on my legs than to get a tan, but the color has made my legs look so much nicer.  </li>
            <li> The spray is great if you do not want a dramatic change over night</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone looking for a self tanning product that delivers a natural looking tan, is economical, quick and simple to apply!</li>
            <li> It works great the first few times but after that the mitt starts to get crusty and it just doesn&#x27;t apply the same as the first times, doesn&#x27;t apply well at all actually.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an easy to apply, good smelling, natural looking self tanner, I would recommend Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I love the tanner, however if you&#x27;re not careful it will streak occasionally.</li>
            <li> It does dry very quickly, and I have not had a problem with it coming off on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> No fake tanner looks like a real tan, but this is by far the closest you can get.  </li>
            <li> everytime you use it to keep it clean and lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I do like the product, it seems pretty much like all the others as far as a tan color.</li>
            <li> Very simple and clean to use.  </li>
            <li> It does dry very quickly and there were areas that looked blended</li>
            <li> This may be called fake bake, but the color it leaves is beautiful and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Speaking of color, It gave me nice medium bronze with a hint of that redness, similar to the tone you get when coming home from a long beach day.</li>
            <li> Most of my body tans very well but for some reason my legs don&#x27;t get dark.  </li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as off hoped but nice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rare that I have any major streaking</li>
            <li> This product left me a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that only looks on the browner side (NO orange or other funky color)</li>
            <li> Application is fail safe, they include a mit, which makes it easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This went on perfect, didn&#x27;t actually have a smell (at least I didn&#x27;t really smell one) and people actually thought I had been tanning at the salon.</li>
            <li> This product dries very fast and so far it stays put on my skin and not on my clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am fair skinned (choose not to tan) with some freckles, I have more of a pink complexion and regularly have a few blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I guess it looked good in pictures because you only saw the front of my legs but looked kind of crazy in real life.  </li>
            <li> After i showered, more than 24 hrs later, i was expecting a light to medium tan after two back to back applications.</li>
            <li> I have Irish skin with lots of freckles I have never been able to tan and self tanners turn me orange, I used fake bake and have a nice golden tan after two uses.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing self tanner online for my daughters high school grad/prom.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to wear a white shirt right after applying and letting dry</li>
            <li> Love love love fake bake!!</li>
            <li> I Love love love fake bake!!</li>
            <li> and it drys fast), and then soften the mitt again before use with a soft brush like a toothbrush or a nail scrubbing brush, not real hard just for a bit to make the mitt soft again so that the tanning product goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I applied it and rinsed it off after 8 hours only to find that certain parts washed off more than others (the color was even before showering)    Three days later</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash the mitt out well after each use, or you will have a stiff, unusable mitt after the first application.  </li>
            <li> It may seem like a hassle to some, but I only tan for special occasions, so</li>
            <li> So I use it for special occasion and try keep it while having my daily routine of hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely picked the right item!</li>
            <li> I got my product super fast once it was back in stock.i</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t soak into the backs of my legs at all, which made the fronts really tan and the backs super white.  </li>
            <li> and this product costs much less and last a lot since comes in good amount</li>
            <li> The glove isn&#x27;t very good quality and gets dirty so fast, and you have to be gentle when washing the glove so it dosen&#x27;t fall apart or get too matted.  </li>
            <li> - i LOVE the color it gives me right after applying &amp; waiting the 6 hours till it sets , but once you take a shower , even if it is the next day , you loose a lot of color .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fantastic thing about this spray is that you can add more or continue to blend it into skin and it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and streaky like other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> Lotions get used up much more quickly AND are more expensive!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly with the mitt that is included, and it has a slight tint</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it arrived quickly and has a very minimal smell compared to most self tanners.</li>
            <li> I did not use it for my face though, so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on that, but on the body it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Well, the best thing I can say about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> As a female in my late 20s, I am really looking at all options to provide me with great skin as I age.</li>
            <li> I will be a customer for as long as this product is available...</li>
            <li> liquid rubs on smoothly and due to its chocolate color, you can tell exactly where you&#x27;ve already applied it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint which was pretty popular based on other reviews is that the bottle does leak but its easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> i have tried many self tanning products and normally discontinue use due to the odor.</li>
            <li> I turned orange in spots, light tan in others and completely no tan in others.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of self tanners over the years, including the original Fake Bake lotion, but this light spray goes on flawlessy and has no odor at all!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product I love it and will always use it&#x27;n looks so natural no orange or streaking just a natural looking tan</li>
            <li> but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It provides a more natural looking color and goes on easily, following the instructions, which are clear.</li>
            <li> If you use the glove that comes with this product and rub in consistent circles, it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have already olive skin and fake bake gives me an even deeper beautiful tan</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;color&#x27; on my face this early in the season.  </li>
            <li> but after 6 hours I took a shower and the excess washed away and just left a nice, even, natural looking tan on my very white legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then I have used Fake Bake about every 3 days and my legs are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanning bed addict since I was young (about 14, and I&#x27;m now 21)</li>
            <li> it looks DARK but is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked the color it gave and the ease of application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless self tanners out there and this one BY FAR gives me the most natural looking.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a nice tan, usually after 2 applications.</li>
            <li> , I look natural and i have a pretty glow.</li>
            <li> After only one application, it gave me a nice golden color that was even and lasted through a couple showers (I exfoliate everyday) without seeming to fade.  </li>
            <li> whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  </li>
            <li> My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  </li>
            <li> My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure this bottle will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s more than plenty dark for me.</li>
            <li> The color on the skin looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Next time I will just go back and pay the $10 extra at Ulta to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> only negative thing I have to say is that I wish the color was more build able</li>
            <li> WOW, This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it made my stretch marks dark and waaaaay more noticeable.</li>
            <li> It still feels just as full some 8-10 applications later as when I got it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;m pretty surprised on the reviews and the scale of the emotions some users express.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the mixture is darker, you can even see if you have any dark patches you need to mix in more.</li>
            <li> The first application made my skin darker but natural looking.  </li>
            <li> looks fairly natural and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> The Mit is nice to use, but small pieces come off of it when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I am a mother of two, full of figure and white as a sheet.  </li>
            <li> While researching Fake Bake Flawless, I noticed that most of the negative reviews were from fair-skinned women like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Micro Mist (a good cheapie), L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (a glittery and splotchy mess) and countless others...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not bad, but I wish it would last  and stay longer on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful for that review, as it was very detailed and helpful to me, as it obviously was to countless others.  </li>
            <li> But the next morning after showering, I was left with a very light, orangey color.</li>
            <li> Overall, most raved about this product, however for someone who is naturally pale like me ( meaning I have no base tan whatsoever)</li>
            <li> After all the years of using self tanners, finely one that actually looks natural.</li>
            <li> The reason this is hands down my favorite tanner, even though I&#x27;ve found one that is darker</li>
            <li> but I made sure to lay down a towel before I went to sleep</li>
            <li> most of the color would wash down the drain.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> SURE TO LAY A TOWEL DOWN WHERE YOU WILL BE DOING THE SUNLESS TANNING.</li>
            <li> When I push the button down, liquid also seeps out around the perimeter of the spray top.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my mitt and start from the top of my leg and work my way down when I get to my feet</li>
            <li> Better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to purchase more and I will never purchase any other product ever again!</li>
            <li> : It dried really fast, and was pretty easy to see where I&#x27;d put it already</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve developed a quick, simple application method for those of you who are interested.</li>
            <li> A little streaky - but good stuff overall!</li>
            <li> a fair skinned Asian and wanted just a little bit of tanning.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated the mitt for applying the tanner to my body and the odor was better than some others I have tried but for some reason all the little sunspots I have on me from not using sunscreen when I was a teenager&lt;br /&gt;Turn</li>
            <li> If you do professionally spray tan this would be nice to use to extend the tan a little longer, sort of like maintaining it.</li>
            <li> Apply as little or as much with the mist and glove it couldn&#x27;t be easier or better.</li>
            <li> I live it!</li>
            <li> I am new to the fake tan world, but after using Million Dollar tan, there is nothing else as good!</li>
            <li> I had what I will call my new, permanent color!</li>
            <li> Also, to keep your mitt like new every time you use it,  rinse it thoroughly every time you use it,  then throw it in the dryer!</li>
            <li> MY NEW GO TO!</li>
            <li> I used this in the evening after watching some YouTube reviews (I&#x27;m new to this!) and had zero problems with application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without the stuff &amp; Amazons price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to sunless tanner!</li>
            <li> I feel like a new woman!  </li>
            <li> Over the past month or two I have tried several different self tanning products, this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I am an experienced self tanner and this product was hard to blend and when it wore off left streaks.  </li>
            <li> If you are tired of frying your skin in the tanning bed and want to look good when you&#x27;re older but want that summer glow try it you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> one is easy to use, works fast &amp; does not cake &amp; peel off after a couple days like the other spray on ones do.&lt;br /&gt;After just 3 days</li>
            <li> I live in Fl, so this didn&#x27;t do much in terms of darkening for me.</li>
            <li> really like the color and new look</li>
            <li> (I live in the desert with a very extended summer)</li>
            <li> With a new baby at home, I don&#x27;t have much time to be in the sun.</li>
            <li> I had no color left...and the insides of my elbow creases were huge white oblong parts where the tanner had completely wiped off.</li>
            <li> I love the fake bake flawless because I want a subtle tan</li>
            <li> I liken this to more of a staining tan product than the typical tanning cream product.  </li>
            <li> I often just apply to my lower half bc I tend to get more sun on my arms and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found out that less is more.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of previous reviewers and followed all tips, which I am sure</li>
            <li> However, if you apply it too often, the color does become less believable.  </li>
            <li> previous poster suggested trimming the spray bottle&#x27;s straw, and that is so important!  </li>
            <li> You can control the amount applied way more than typical lotions.</li>
            <li> As the bottle emptied the rubbing into my skin became less noticeable and took more sprays.</li>
            <li> Apply it before bed, its really easy and wash it off in the morning, about half the color gets washed away but whats left if a light BROWN (not orange) tan.</li>
            <li> Less is more.  </li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more since I like the end results and this product cost less then most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is typical of most self tanners I have used though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lotion but gave me much better color for less.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to blend it all perfectly again.</li>
            <li> : make sure to cut about an inch and a half off of the straw BEFORE inserting it into the tanner bottle.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely easy to use if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to make sure that you exfoliate and moisturize your skin prior to using it.  </li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m constantly alternating between being super bronzed looking and looking like</li>
            <li> I have tried several drugstore tanning products and none of them compare with Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> AwayTips:&lt;br /&gt;- Do not be afraid to apply generously... just be sure to rub in nice and evenly</li>
            <li> I was pregnant in the winter months so never got any sun, and used this very regularly.</li>
            <li> I was very white so color showed up quick this morning.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy a second bottle if I didn&#x27;t absolutely love a product because I always like trying out different products.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and it gives her a decent tanned look all things considered.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning spray after watching countless review videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li> B000RUD6EK GlowFusion Micro-Nutrient Face and Body Natural Protein Tan, Light Formula, 5.0 Fluid Ounces (147.85ml)]]</li>
            <li> My main issue with it though was that it stunk-</li>
            <li> Spreads evenly, absorbs instantly, dries quickly, DOESN&#x27;T stink.</li>
            <li> So the next night, because it dries so quickly, I applied it twice before bed.</li>
            <li> OK so I love fake Bake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used this product before, I&#x27;ve been using body drench quick tan before this and am going back to that product after this.</li>
            <li> and I have bought MANY over the last ten years&lt;</li>
            <li> I also tried one of the Banana Boat products, but the smell was super perfumy;  it streaked, it took forever to absorb, it was super messy  and the results were very John Boehner;</li>
            <li> It still was decent though.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the Fake Bake product is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Next I tried Fake Bake Flawless</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase this product, I&#x27;ve actually already got some more on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this spray but it was different then what expected I used the st topez along with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-fades quickly with water, almost all with facial cleanser</li>
            <li> It smells decent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking streaky or orange.</li>
            <li> First off the color tan that I got is a definite ORANGE - remember some of those first self-tanners?  </li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best fake tan I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love having a tan in the winter and most people don&#x27;t believe or can&#x27;t tell if&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> If you have tried several other home tanning products but have never been quite satisfied, try this one!</li>
            <li> I have the same brand for the face, which is different because it is more like a cream.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product, and the first time I bought it was a year ago - it really lasts!</li>
            <li> I also got Fake Bake for faces - and I love that stuff even more.  </li>
            <li> I am a self tanner junkie and have tried any decent product I can get my hands on.</li>
            <li> if it would only last more than a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After finishing a whole bottle of Fake Bake, I&#x27;m happy to report that the velour mitten is still in tact.</li>
            <li> it has a bit of a red tint, so It looks completely natural and streak free.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just the chemical reaction with my particular skin type, but I found it intolerable.  </li>
            <li> Need to invest in a decent application mit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A decent amount of product comes off if you apply at night in shower in the morning like recommended, I prefer to apply in the morning/afternoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different tanners that have left me streaky, smelly, and orange.</li>
            <li> Being as ghostly white as I am I was super nervous to try this.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I took a shower and made sure to exfoliate very well, got out (dried off, etc.) and applied the self tanner as the directions had said.</li>
            <li> i have been using jergens daily glow to keep from getting super pasty</li>
            <li> No messy hands that you have to be careful to wash before they stain, and it seems to blend in to the skin even better than the lotion did.</li>
            <li> Goes on quickly and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> The shade is a bit lighter than other self tanners that I have used but it looks SO much more natural!</li>
            <li> I opened the second bottle and it came with a set of the blue gloves, and a mitt but no sprayer so make sure you keep the sprayer.  </li>
            <li> I did find that the product does have the classic &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here today ordering my second bottle of the Fake Bske because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last long...seems to fade fairly quick.</li>
            <li> I had the Fake Bake lotion before and while I did like the color it gave me, it left my skin feeling a bit sticky and the smell wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use Fake Bake Flawless....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Fades rather quickly but in that respect similar to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am an older redhead.</li>
            <li> This particular one seems sort of &#x27;expired&#x27; or something.  </li>
            <li> So glad my sister talked me into trying Fake Bake, I am now a bronze beauty. :)</li>
            <li> Product does deliver both immediate and gradual results but washes off so quickly that it needs constant re application.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face, neck, arms during the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get a great tan without all that annoying skin cancer risk.  </li>
            <li> but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve been concerned about the effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Best fake tanner I have ever used, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Instant quick fix for pasty skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve found at the drugstore and wasn&#x27;t much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, but I grew tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even smart to blow dry your body with COOL AIR before application even if you haven&#x27;t just gotten out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, tan is very natural.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and have a VERY natural color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very even, no streaking, and a very natural color..</li>
            <li> Really like the mitten-is very soft on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for fake bake flawless after reading countless reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it more, and again it does work, but the cons make it hard to want to use it consistently</li>
            <li> I was surprised after the mass of positive reviews how lukewarm I was on this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and it gave me a nice brown tan not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much my skin was going to like this product because I am fairly pale.</li>
            <li> I think the more basic, plain CLEAN</li>
            <li> I am someone who is very new to self tanning, I have only tried a couple of other brands, and I just couldn&#x27;t quite get the hang of a nice, even tan.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t have that bad &amp;#34;fake tan smell.&amp;#34; I really love it!</li>
            <li> The color is very flattering and natural looking, I think I almost gave my dermatologist a heart attack when I went in for a check up!</li>
            <li> Goes on very even, dries in seconds with no residue, shows where color has been applied, and looks natural!</li>
            <li> No streaking and a very natural brown (not orange!)</li>
            <li> When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings, works great for a tan, but the smell and how you feel the days following are almost not worth the tan.</li>
            <li> Very Natural Color!</li>
            <li> color isn&#x27;t too orange and came off very natural!</li>
            <li> Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> VERY NATURAL LOOKING!</li>
            <li> Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> The easiest way is to snip off about an inch off the bottom of the spray top and use that instead of the lotion cap to avoid mess.</li>
            <li> I had a bit left in the old bottle too, so I used some in the new and poured the rest from the old bottle into the new one. :)</li>
            <li> You can wear light loose cloths if wanted.</li>
            <li> While this color is great for me, I find it does streak on me when my skin is dry, and I have moisturized for a few days!</li>
            <li> so I stripped down with my new container (which did not leak from the top).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, I would also highly recommend 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> its very important to &#x27;loofah&#x27; or scrub dead skin before application.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe the demand is just getting too high</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this self-tanner.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot but fond that sun labs tanner actually works better and lasts longer and is only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I read numerous reviews for different products and decided that Fake Bake Flawless was worth trying.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist also told me I shouldn&#x27;t because of my high risk skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> (yes, they used to call me \\&quot;Casper\\&quot; in high school)</li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend giving it a try even if you&#x27;ve tried everything else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> HIGHLY IMPROVES THE LOOK OF YOUR EXTREMITIES WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SCARS AND DISCOLORIZATION.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> From drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get your hopes too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li> Anywho, if you&#x27;ve never used this stuff, I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> It honestly looks very much like other tanning products, I felt, and even though I exfoliated and followed directions to lotion up around the knees and rough patches, it still grabbed there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to continue to purchase it, but I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as amazing as all of the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> its a no brainier, this stuff is so much staffer, looks way nice, and last, plus cost soo much less.</li>
            <li> product dries quickly and you can get dressed within 10 minutes - not 2 hours (did I mention my last self-tanning adventure involved sitting naked in the tub watching Golden Girls for 2 hours?).</li>
            <li> The product goes on evenly, dries super fast, and has a very deep natural color.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I gave four stars is because you have to really make sure to moisturize and exfoliate or it can leave dry patches and look splotchy in areas like elbows, ankles and wrists.</li>
            <li> However, it is as easy as slipping on pantyhose to make your legs look freshly tanned vs. white as a ghost.</li>
            <li> she just pierced a hole in the center and inserted the tube through the hole and hers worked fine doing it that way.  </li>
            <li> Line the counter and sink with a large old towel</li>
            <li> Compared to my usual spray tan, this one washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> This looks so natural and NO STREAKS!!</li>
            <li> Looks natural!!</li>
            <li> Have to reapply every couple of day, and I wish it gave me a little more color than it does...</li>
            <li> Each day lightening a little bit more.</li>
            <li> This is even better than having a spray tan done because you get to choose how dark to go!</li>
            <li> I bought a jergens one that seemed to work a little better plus a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> &amp; of course I love the fact that I can protect my health a little bit from using this product &amp; staying away from tanning beds.</li>
            <li> you want a little more color.</li>
            <li> I would stick to this, but it requires a little more upkeep if you wash your face twice a day like me.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little more streaky than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I learned that the deep rich brown color, is the color guard, pretty much an instant bronzer that guides you in applying the stuff evenly on your body.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels with a little sun-kissed glow, NOT leather couch skin or cheeto skin</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a dream come true!</li>
            <li> I was going to the tanning bed hibitually to prepare for spring break until I found this little gem :)</li>
            <li> I tried pray tans but looked a little orange even with the better brands</li>
            <li> little do they know I&#x27;m doing it the \\&quot;safe</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think I need to apply it 5 days in a row, as I tan rather quickly, so every other day will be fine until I reach the desired shade.</li>
            <li> I am as pasty as it gets, I am always getting comments on how pasty I am and how I&#x27;d look so much better with a little tan or bronzer.</li>
            <li> So natural and safer than using a tanning bed!!</li>
            <li> Third, the mitt got scraggly and pilled even after the first use!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit of a labor of love to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;which may be applied a little easier and more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> It could be designed a little better but it is what it is</li>
            <li> I love it when I just want to look a little tanner before I go out.</li>
            <li> If you want a little darker color, just use more sprays.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a pretty large amount of self tanners, and this one and Sungoddess are the only two i will use!</li>
            <li> You really can not mess this up!</li>
            <li> I will say this faded very quickly for me, and I had to reapply every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanning products and none has been as easy to use as this one.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other mitts that I&#x27;ve used, this one will allow the product to easily seep through</li>
            <li> I like that the product doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner smell that other products reek of.</li>
            <li> BUT it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as other brands I&#x27;ve tried AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> Kind of hard to get on even</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is like any other self-tanner, strong and bothersome.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mess up my newly applied tan :)</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a long-lasting natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Very natural-looking, forgiving if you put it on a little unevenly, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used for last year and half and love this product!</li>
            <li> It tries FAST and will leave some streaks if you don&#x27;t rub in right away!</li>
            <li> I have very light olive skin (due to my lack of desire for skin cancer) with several large colored tattoos.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t use it all the time is because it is a little more time consuming than just lotion and with a new infant around, my time is pretty used up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant, this producted prevented me from being super pale at my baby shower.  </li>
            <li> Also, applying it to your whole body or most of it uses be very little of the bottle</li>
            <li> This product was very easy to apply using the mitt, however the spray bottle has begun to leak all over my bathroom so its very messy.  </li>
            <li> The color Fake Bake produced was beautiful, for I am not pale anyways,</li>
            <li> Secondly, the application goes on very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t dry before I am done applying it</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly if you do it right and last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> the smell isnt bad at all and the best part</li>
            <li> Everywhere else it looks perfect and doesnt look bad on my stomach either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> My tan was very even and natural.</li>
            <li> Works great and it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Allow the product to dry, I normally just hang out, clean up the news paper, and put everything</li>
            <li> This is by far waaaaay better than the more expensive stuff I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and there is not a product that you can receive as great results so quickly as Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it again a second time a few weeks later and wasn&#x27;t too happy with the mit.</li>
            <li> but in reading around on Amazon, I read the great reviews here for Fake Bake, and decided since it was not a spray-on product</li>
            <li> Does great job of coverage, goes on even and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> They were all very orange looking and never looked natural....</li>
            <li> it works really well and looks like my natural tan</li>
            <li> Looks real natural when it develops and it also gives you some color as you put it on.</li>
            <li> it smells like day old self tanner and too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I think the color is very even and natural looking.</li>
            <li> every use of the buffing pad clean it off and hang it to dry in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray on the mitt and rub in circles lightly over toes, and then harder on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, the reviews on here were great, so I thought how can I go wrong?</li>
            <li> In this case, while the reviews were great, I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> It really does leave your skin beautifully natural and bronzed.</li>
            <li> I spray directly on my skin and then rub it in, otherwise the mitt absorbs too much.</li>
            <li> so tanning beds and natural sun have never done a whole lot for me; except burn.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is a great product.</li>
            <li> Friends have been surprised because it looks real.  </li>
            <li> but since my body isn&#x27;t that bikini ready anyway, I&#x27;ve been just applying it to my legs and arms and tummy, steering clear of the boobs.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged caucasion male, and this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> The color is natural looking, dries fast</li>
            <li> a girl at work who uses fake bake and always has great color,  suggested it to me.</li>
            <li> I wash mine with my shampoo until it runs clear, wring it out gently, and hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did give me the most natural, most even fake tan that I&#x27;ve ever had though.</li>
            <li> Natural color,no streaking,or missed spots thanks to the color guide.</li>
            <li> I was still very weary since it seems that no matter what I try, I can never get natural looking results.</li>
            <li> Works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Another important thing to note, application can get pretty messy.</li>
            <li> And i exfoliated every few days to try and make the tan fade more evenly, but it still looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;-Since</li>
            <li> It gave me a deep summer golden glow.</li>
            <li> Aferw rinsing, you&#x27;re left with a golden tan.</li>
            <li> Water will run brownish, and is normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanners, and normally I use Xen Tan but decided I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a better looking, darker color than tanning everyday.</li>
            <li> It in my opinion is well worth the money especially when compared to what it costs to get a spray tan.</li>
            <li> It truely dries instantly on your skin, with NO horrible odor usually associated with self tanners.</li>
            <li> i wish there was more green tone tho, so that it would cancel out any redness and orange</li>
            <li> I am planning on buying more in the future and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And yes this is a reasonable conclusion to think, but first let me tell you, I have a medical skin condition.</li>
            <li> Now I blend in with all the people around me with normal levels of melanin in their skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with a yellowish/greenish skin tone so this product makes my skin look golden.</li>
            <li> Most products take a few hours to develop.</li>
            <li> It gives you a really natural dark color and streak free!</li>
            <li> Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I decide to tan this would b the only product I ever use :-)</li>
            <li> Color is good, however, not as dark as expected.</li>
            <li> Only sign of any sunless tanner smell is when you first wash in the shower after applying...and even then, the smell is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t risk skin cancer when you can have a beautiful, natural looking Fake Bake tan.</li>
            <li> I found that after 1 application for 3 consecutive days, I achieved a tan that I would only hope to get after a summer&#x27;s worth of tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times, and I love my color.</li>
            <li> But overall I thin it is one of the best especially if you don&#x27;t want to wait a week for the moisturizer types to work.</li>
            <li> I apply, I use a few sprays in a tiny bowl and mix in just enough good white lotion (in this case, &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; by Designer Skin) to allow myself to spread the product with smooth and even coverage after thoroughly exfoliating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, please make sure to wash the mit that is included with product every few tans.</li>
            <li> It was a tint of green, more like a blue-green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some interesting experiences with self-tanners in the past and was ready to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Fake Bake at a Beauty Salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is in fact NOT a negative review.</li>
            <li> just make sure they are heavily moisturized.</li>
            <li> wear full coverage cotton panties and give your self a wedgie immediately after applying the tanner and for a couple hours so that the color won&#x27;t run even from minor sweating and concentrate on your bum crack edges.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the extra work -</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it a few hours before bed</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can spray the tanner directly onto most parts of your body, but for parts such as your face, hands, feet, elbows, knees, neck and back, you will want to spray the tanner onto your mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After you shower the next day, it washes off in some places but, not others so, it will never be an even tan.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li> However, I use quite a bit of it, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it would for most people.</li>
            <li> coconut does not smell like normal self tanners.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this 5 starts because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my favorite (Million Dollar Tan).  </li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for products</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works from the dead of winter on my fair skin, to a touch up in the middle of the summer to cover bikini lines or even the natural tan from the sun that I have.</li>
            <li> I also have a few tattoos that I care to keep looking nice, especially because I&#x27;ve invested so much money into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> goes on without streaks, looks natural, and one layer is light enough even if you make a mistake (which i did while I&#x27;m getting the hang of it) that it isn&#x27;t completely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but even after exfoliating using a Kae exfoliating glove, it still goes on unevenly and looks orange.</li>
            <li> it has more of a green undertone than orange an</li>
            <li> but more importantly, it never develops the &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li> normal people tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update on again on the progress of color after a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> Love this self tanner it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping for ( about 3 days instead of a week)</li>
            <li> I took a shower in the morning and the excess washed off and left behind a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> So overall, I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this product again, it just not worth the price and in order for me to keep any kind of color I have to put a ton of it on</li>
            <li> I love the color, I am also pretty white &amp; it wasn&#x27;t to dark or orange.</li>
            <li> Second, it does not last long, it may give you a nice glow but after 2-3 showers its pretty much completely gone.</li>
            <li> Normally they&#x27;re streaky and orange.</li>
            <li> It gives a great long lasting dark color.</li>
            <li> When I try to tan normally all that happens is my freckles get darker</li>
            <li> I do notice the green, which I am sure this is to counteract the orange, so, you don&#x27;t want to put this on then leave the house.</li>
            <li> or make sure you wipe off the dried excess product with</li>
            <li> I used fake bake first, and felt like it was good product.</li>
            <li> It is  pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> So make sure you use it fast and don&#x27;t use it if it looks green!</li>
            <li> but once you wash it off you are left with a golden tan.</li>
            <li> but overall it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I do it every time, and it&#x27;s been used three times now to equal success each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I saw the small container of it, I didn&#x27;t want to be having to purchase more of it very often.</li>
            <li> I put a layer on and thought maybe I will like this, but after a full day I just went back to my natural skin tone, which is disapointing.</li>
            <li> also make sure you don&#x27;t sweat or go out in the rain after you use it that color guard is messy and will get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on one day it pretty much comes off with the following shower.</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning because of how many customers would come in crying about getting skin cancer (yet they still tanned?)</li>
            <li> gets you looking like you went somewhere nice and hot and spent your whole time laying out when really you just spent a few minutes rubbing the fake bake flawless in...</li>
            <li> I was so tired of spending money trying to find a good self tanner.</li>
            <li> So, If you want a nice &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; golden tan and your really fair, like me, try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!   </li>
            <li> Takes a few days to build up, when tint washes off a lot of the color is lost, be careful on knuckles color can build up, thanks for good transaction.</li>
            <li> Whether you  are new or experienced with fake tanning, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had been driving with the windows down and my left arm was more naturally tan than the right</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t leave streaks at long as you cover everything...which easy enough since you can see where it is going on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li> although it seems to take so little to rub in, I think this bottle may last quite awhile, even better!</li>
            <li> The tan is super natural, golden, and dark.</li>
            <li> It was a nice realistic color otherwise, just not good for my older skin.</li>
            <li> live in FL, so try to stay tan year round, mostly the beach during the summer, but use this stuff during the winter to keep my color.</li>
            <li> First, spray the mitt, rub it on evenly (which I had no problem doing) and it dries right away although you can&#x27;t get wet for about 5 hours</li>
            <li> I have gotten my Mom to get this, who is even more pale than I am</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely pale and never been able to tan.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m more of an olive tone , my friend is really pale , she uses it once a day , &amp; doesn&#x27;t tan in salons .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its ok ,doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> The application mitt is AMAZING, although its surface becomes less applicable, the nap enhances your initial results.</li>
            <li> I think it lasts like two days on me, but I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and gives super white people like me a natural tan.  </li>
            <li> however, most of the ones I&#x27;ve used have a weird smell or streak easily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a self tanner that did not have an odd odor and gave a nice bronze color that lasted for several days.</li>
            <li> The application is easy and my fake tan never looked better.  </li>
            <li> It will fade very quickly and likely only give you color for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena Micro-mist can easily be sprayed to the middle of my back without rubbing or staining floors.</li>
            <li> Instant tan and is easy enough to apply even minutes before going out for the day/night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (only took me about 8 minutes total to apply) and</li>
            <li> He actually commented this morning that he did not smell anything at all and that it looks super natural,</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we both love this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and will keep using it.  </li>
            <li> first get the dry skin off and also apply lotion to elbows,ankles, knees, etc first because it gets darker on those spots  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, it&#x27;s easy to use and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> the brightest moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for ladies with busts that are larger... make sure when you do your chest area, you are careful to have a fan at the ready so that you can dry the area rather quickly.</li>
            <li> &amp; it does not make you SUPER dark the first time you use it</li>
            <li> threw out all of the other self tanners that probably added up to $500, and I will definitely purchase more of this very soon, plus one for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guide color is very dark, which was great because you really can&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not the fastest, I think properly prepping your skin and applying this right makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before applying the tanner I exfoliated one time earlier in the week, and then again right before the application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally streaky right off the bat.</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my face and neck right now because i dont want to wear foundation</li>
            <li> (ie: right leg, left leg, chest, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but obviously it was not the right tanner for me.</li>
            <li> As for the reviews that say the tan washes off the next morning, I would like to debunke that right now.</li>
            <li> Dries instantly, you can get dressed right after&lt;</li>
            <li> and I personally like that it washes right off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it all right away and went to use it a month or so later.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that I learned when using this is... do not use it right after you have shaved your legs.</li>
            <li> so I can hop into bed right after and wake up with a tan the next morning.</li>
            <li> simple to use,tans evenly,great smell and the price is right.</li>
            <li> all the brown spray cleaned right off later).  </li>
            <li> I did, however, accidentally spray it on a pair of white pants, and it washed right off in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> It fades very evenly and even looks natural as the color fades (seems to lose a little bit of the red and just look like a nice brown/golden tan).</li>
            <li> i am very pale and this gave a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> If certain spots look a little thicker, the residual product washes off in the shower so it looks smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have figured out how to use the spray without making a huge mess, yet I am saddened that I am wasting as much as I am using.</li>
            <li> If your not sure or are UN happy with other self banners Then give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and provides a dark tan</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s dark brown color makes it easy to see whre</li>
            <li> Since the tanning liquid is dark, it is easy to see where you have applied it.  </li>
            <li> so you either need to add more or scrub it off, and it is not easy to get off</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to apply but way too dark for my ivory skin.  </li>
            <li> The color tome was good, gave me a tan that was not too dark, and with careful application it does not streak!</li>
            <li> I followed many tips from previous reviewers and would agree that with proper application and a little common sense this stuff is wonderful.....</li>
            <li> ; Dark Tanner which seemed to be a little more subtle - great for last minute application the night before for a special event.</li>
            <li> My skin has yellow undertones and the color is very natural looking, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply especially with this mitt!  </li>
            <li> Received fake bake and love the product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will fail to forcibly confine you to your bathroom naked with a good friend watching Betty White for two hours wondering how in the hell you are going to explain what happened to the tub to mom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d worry about getting too dark if I used Original any more frequently than this.&lt;br /&gt;-Flawless, on the other hand, takes a couple consecutive nights to get it to a darker color, then probably a touch-up every 4 days or so?</li>
            <li> Mitts however, only work when you first get them, after one wash they start to develop these balls / pills that make the texture hard and tan doesn&#x27;t apply as effectively.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell but not bad like most other products.  </li>
            <li> It was not extreme and no streaks, when he washed very little came off and the spray has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I just walk around the house naked for awhile to make sure its 1,000 percent dry before I apply my clothes!</li>
            <li> First, this gives you a more subtle color</li>
            <li> I have very light skin tone with natural blonde hair,blue eyes, and it takes very long time to tan</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no streaks and the smell is not as unpleasant as most self tanners.  </li>
            <li> and you can buy hospital gloves on the cheap at other stores,</li>
            <li> Exfoliating first then applying to dry clean skin is key.</li>
            <li> Its a little messy getting on, but I have had a lot of complements and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so liquidy and watery, whereas my other tanners were thicker lotions or a light</li>
            <li> I do recommend moisturizing your skin with your daily lotion BEFORE applying Fake Bake Flawless, but that generally goes for any self tanning product.</li>
            <li> I have a light olive complexion but I am lighter due to stayimg out of the sun.</li>
            <li> I woke up with a natural glow but wanted a little more</li>
            <li> you live in florida</li>
            <li> I am completely new to bottled tan products.</li>
            <li> I live this product.</li>
            <li> This is surely my new \\&quot;gold standard!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Scrap the mitt and but a new one for 10 bucks that doesn&#x27;t need a glove underneath</li>
            <li> I will do that again with my new one.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida but do not want to LOOK like I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I live in a not so sunny part of the country</li>
            <li> I had to order a new mit.  </li>
            <li> Without applying any new product to the mitt go ahead and do the tops and sides of your feet and toes, backs of hands, fingers and wrists avoiding the cuticles.</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it...</li>
            <li> so you get a new one each time.</li>
            <li> I hope I can find a new one.</li>
            <li> I moved from Florida to New York</li>
            <li> There was just no way this product was going to live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> Did not return or ask for a refund because as a sunless tanner trying new products this is the risk you take, I do not believe in returning just because it did not work for me, I used the product about 5 times and threw away.</li>
            <li> I do live the humid south and if you apply this and then go get sweaty</li>
            <li> I can live with coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d never know I live in the Alaskan wilderness.  </li>
            <li> As with any new product, you have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas</li>
            <li> If someone know a trick to that, then let me in on that because I&#x27;m fairly new at using self tanners.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a natural looking tan, this will be your new go to!</li>
            <li> I am not naturally pale, but this definitely helps give me the golden tan that I want without having to use tanning beds anymore.</li>
            <li> All self tanners have the same underlying smell from the active ingredient, but this one is very minimal, and the scent itself is great.  </li>
            <li> I live in CA at the beach where it&#x27;s pretty much sunny all year long.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t make it so its a huge difference in color but enough to wear dresses and short sleeve shirts and have some color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to try any because I have seen a lot of people left with a very orange-y aftereffect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few self tanners and this one gives the most natural color of any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My flannel gray sheets did get a brownish red tint on them as I slept with freshly applied tanner on myself, but it completely washed out when I washed them.</li>
            <li> There will always be drawbacks, but so far, Fake Bake has been a surprisingly great product</li>
            <li> Have used many self tanners, cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> but it would dry so quickly</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s better than the spray tans that make your whole bathroom/hallway stink for a day.  </li>
            <li> As always, make sure you are careful with hands, knees, elbows, and feet, but the mitt definitely helps this issue.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly, and if it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> (I have super dry skin).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do tanning booths, I was in the middle of my finals for my Ph.D. for several months during the summer and my skin hadn&#x27;t seen the light of day for months</li>
            <li> I then put a light coat of lotion on my knees, ankles, tops and sides of both feet, wrists (inner and outer), elbows (inner and outer) and around my armpits.</li>
            <li> dry quickly.    </li>
            <li> It does dry quickly</li>
            <li> my bottle is about half gone and the mitt is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased to get even a little color!</li>
            <li> I also love how smooth it goes on and very little streaking if you&#x27;re careful!</li>
            <li> It will make your legs have little brown spots all over if you apply right after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> This is very natural looking and quick to apply and dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single product out there for creating a fake tan, and this stuff is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I had a little problem at first, but I learned quickly how to apply it, it just takes practice like anything.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, and isn&#x27;t splotchy or runny.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it isn&#x27;t that dark unless you apply it at least twice within 24 hours  but again the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> very natural looking</li>
            <li> This one gives you an instant tan, very real looking.</li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly without streaking and a very natural brown vs orange like some others.</li>
            <li> It was always very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very natural looking</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, no orange tinge.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>

            <li> Exfoliate first and let a light moisturizer sink in before using if you have dry skin, otherwise it can stick to dry spots.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to mess this up and end up looking streaky.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt application, NO STREAKS and you use VERY little product.  </li>
            <li> First, it really does dry well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it last as long as I would like, but it is so easy to apply</li>
            <li> super dark woman, thanks</li>
            <li> The tan is super easily buildable over just a few days and is pretty long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> she had a very nice light brown (base) tan.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and can go as light or dark as I want.</li>
            <li> I imagine you could apply more often or thicker to get a deeper color, but I usually stick with re-applying every 3-5 days and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put on with an enclosed smooth glove and left no streaks, it dried immediately so you don&#x27;t have to avoid furniture or clothes for an hour, and it left my legs brown not orange.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is amazing!</li>
            <li> have used so many self tanners that have all rubbed off on my clothes or came off in the shower or just stunk really bad, and I finally found this one that smells really good applying it</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that didn&#x27;t leave streaks on me and that actually made me look alot darker.</li>
            <li> Feels Soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> In comparison to different tanning formulas, specifically lotions, I find that they develop better on my skin and my golden tan stays that way for at least 5 days before I need to reaaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> After watching many reviews I decided to buy this product I was skeptical at first since it was my first time tanning</li>
            <li> After I washed it off the first morning, I actually reapplied it because I had plans to go out that night.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and goes on evenly!  </li>
            <li> So natural!</li>
            <li> I use a sigma f80 brush after I have applied moisturizer to spread it on my face/neck/ears area and it eliminates the need completely for a separate face tanner!.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, especially for first time self tanner users, because it is tinted</li>
            <li> even after 3 days the tan still looks natural it is not orange at all!  </li>
            <li> And I have sensitive acne prone skin, and I have not broke out from this!</li>
            <li> Use regular lotion first so you don&#x27;t get any blotches.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this time it has been streaking on my skin more than usual.</li>
            <li> Take a shower first and exfoliate if you want the tan to last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re interested in this product also invest in some extra mitts if you want to continue to use.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My husband kids me when I wear dresses about my legs providing light for a dark room.</li>
            <li> The only con would be to make sure you are prepared to change your bedsheets the next day as it does transfer (not necessarily taking your applied color off).</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already completely hooked!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me more than the ten minutes (other reviewers stated)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me more than the ten minutes (other reviewers stated)</li>
            <li> The benefit to this is you can make it as dark or as light as you want, you can mix it with any fragrance lotion and it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you are wearing self-tanner</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many self tanners in the past and I will never use another one after finding this.</li>
            <li> and oh so natural!</li>
            <li> After 3-4 applications in a row (only exfoliating the first time)</li>
            <li> and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> Color looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li> So natural!</li>
            <li> Not orange, natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> This one far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> This is better then spray tans I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> So I recommend following that first review to a tee, except replacing the Baiden mitten with a Korean Italy pocket cloth.  </li>
            <li> But, low and behold, it just needed that first application period, I guess, to get settled in.  </li>
            <li> My love for fake bake products started with the original lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used many different self-tanners before in my life, and from the reviews, I was expecting a lot more when I used Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I faked everyone with this product that I had tanned naturally over a weekend!</li>
            <li> word of caution, make sure you wear gloves under your mitt or you&#x27;ll end up with orange hands :/</li>
            <li> I have more then enough left to use several times.</li>
            <li> and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Million Dollar Tanning products, and I&#x27;ve got to say that this by far beats it!</li>
            <li> This is only required before the first use.</li>
            <li> or it will look funny and not adhere to your skin properly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake the original lotion for years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> complaints so far!</li>
            <li> This has definitely been better than some of the other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried but still not what I was hoping for, once again.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed how natural this product feels and looks!</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews and bought this and WOW!  </li>
            <li> One bottle will last you a couple months with consistent use.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, not orange at all!</li>
            <li> It gives off a color similar to Loreal&#x27;s original Sublime Glow, which was a different formula than the one they use now.</li>
            <li> --It looks really natural!</li>
            <li> I can put enough spray on to make myself look pretty tan, and even keep it on for 12 hours before taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Repurchased the same week I started using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> overall, the bottle says to reapply for darker results, which I plan on doing the next couple nights to see if I notice a significant difference or not.  </li>
            <li> it lasts about 2-3 days and is pretty faded by the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> However, I washed it in warm water and used a teasing brush to fluff it back up (eyelash or bristle brush would have the same effect).</li>
            <li> If the mitt had velour on both sides, there would be risk for rubbing extra tanning solution in random places, most notably on your body where it can leave a streak.</li>
            <li> Most unbelievably of all?</li>
            <li> The original formula is messy and stinky but worked really well</li>
            <li> It goes on more smoothly, no streaks, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells like a coconut sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I received several compliments on my tan the first week I used it, and someone even asked if I had gone to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my first time using it</li>
            <li> I was able to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and ten minutes later put on my white summer evening dress.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best,  it doesn&#x27;t smell funky and fake other self tanners,  </li>
            <li> and I had such a pretty color.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how my instant tan looked SO REAL !</li>
            <li> and even then you must have to sleep splayed out, on your back all night so as to keep your legs from touching each other, etc.&lt;br /&gt;......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same color I got from the salon self tanner, no weird orange color but can be streaky until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leak at all during my first application last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I totally reccomend this product and it got me through a whole summer with just ONE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> i ordered this product and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> if anything it makes my skin look more even and hides my scars now!i usually have to use concealer over foundation to even out my skin and today i just used a bit of BB cream.</li>
            <li> It looks natural looking!  </li>
            <li> In my early years I worshipped the tanning bed just so I could look normal in the summer months</li>
            <li> , so I know exactly how you should properly prep your skin and apply.)</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> I noticed a pretty glowing tan instantly!</li>
            <li> Fake bake actually smells good!</li>
            <li> After showering I looked pretty white.</li>
            <li> I love the original fake bake but thought I would try this out.</li>
            <li> I even measured the straw up next to the side of the bottle to make sure it was cut short enough.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my face, but since there is usually quite a bit of product on the mitt, there is no need to spray more.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s most likely due to me not exfoliating as well as I should have beforehand.</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan with no streaks!</li>
            <li> It looks SO natural, and so affordable!</li>
            <li> First time my white</li>
            <li> Looks so natural and NO STREAKS and takes NO TIME!</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> Natural, no way to overdo with color!</li>
            <li> #34;This does not turn your skin orange, you look like you just came back from the beach, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell!&amp;#34; I recieved it in the mail along with the body exfoliant, and that night I was in the bathroom with a big smile on my face getting ready to get my tan on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews for products but this stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have used so many sunless tanners and usually give up on them after 2 or 3 uses.</li>
            <li> be aware that it will discolor your sheets and white clothes.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked at tanning salons, and been an avid tanner for the last 5-6 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and will be repurchasing as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> This self tanner definitely smells better than any other tanner I have ever used</li>
            <li> First thing, I am pastey white.</li>
            <li> I could not love this product more</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same odor as many other tanning products do.</li>
            <li> Only streaks if you aren&#x27;t paying attention or don&#x27;t exfoliate first.</li>
            <li> My bf, my coworkers, and my friends have all marveled at how naturally tan Fake-Bake made me!</li>
            <li> You can see this in action as you apply it, so no waiting on it to set to know where you messed up!</li>
            <li> Seemed to make me darker the first time I used it than subsequent times but goes on without streaking.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever I was actually called tan.</li>
            <li> only problem is it only last for about 3 days at the most.</li>
            <li> Second of all- the applicator that came with pilled and fell off on my bathroom floor during the first application-</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have been spray tanning (by professional) for over 8 years and costs about $50 each time!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It does have the usual odor of most products of this type, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure where you can get more .</li>
            <li> and it looks exactly like same!</li>
            <li> Using the professional mitt you get an even tan that is not in anyway orange!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I put it on before I go out and usually touch it up every 4 days or so.</li>
            <li> have keratosis pilaris on my arms (red bumps &amp;#34;acne like&amp;#34;) and I resort to tanning to help take away the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle (the first lasted over a month I think), and have learned some tricks since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this BY FAR is #1 (and inexpensive!).</li>
            <li> I was finally able to stop searching for something better after discovering Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> I do have to apply it everyday to get a half way decent color, but I am fair skinned and freckly, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Still, it was pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for me (as I am super pale)</li>
            <li> After making sure my skin was completely dry, I rubbed a small dab on Vitamin E Oil on my knee area and rubbed it in well, just to make sure they weren&#x27;t too dry.</li>
            <li> , it does dry very fast, I got a golden glow from this tanner almost instantly</li>
            <li> sure to spray almost the entire soft side of the mitt and apply in circular motions...or else the color will saturate to heavy in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I only experienced a little too much build up at my ankles and elbows a few times</li>
            <li> , I woke up with a huge streak down my arm.</li>
            <li> It usually worked out fine, and you couldn&#x27;t really tell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend pointing a fan directly at yourself or it may dry too quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, lasts long enough.  </li>
            <li> it will give u a pretty decent color.for how long,</li>
            <li> I consider myself a connoisseur of fake tanning products, and this is definitely a good one, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> This goes on dry, you barely have any color come off on clothes, it smells great, and the color lasts at least a week (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> This is great for winter to give a little color without going overboard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply but even with using it daily for 10 days there was a barely noticeable change between my upper and forearm.</li>
            <li> I 100% recommend it to anyone that wants a quick long lasting tan.  </li>
            <li> Most men would never dream of using a fake tan, but I am a firm believer in looking your best year round.</li>
            <li> this self tanner gives a very natural brown tan not orange at all and my natural skin color is pretty white ..also lasts a couple days and doesn&#x27;t look streaky</li>
            <li> If you like \\&quot;Fake Bake &amp; it works &amp; looks good on YOU, then I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> (I actually just add a little cream blush on my cheeks to make it look more realistic.</li>
            <li> It may be a little more orangey than other high end tanners but it still looks fine as long as you don&#x27;t do it every day.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic and have yellow undertones, I can get pretty pasty with no tan, I just started using self tanners this summer, and this was the 2nd brand that I have tried, first of all the box, the mitt  look in no way cheap, but I paid so little for this</li>
            <li> Takes me 10 minutes tops and always looks better than being pale!</li>
            <li> This fake bake does smell nice though unlike most other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d have to reapply this at least every other day for it to stay fresh and nice looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now let me warn you, at first, you may start to see dark brown spots in areas that are a tad more callous than other areas.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is as good as it gets as far as sunless tanning goes!!</li>
            <li> So if you are pale, or use more than one squirt you may get dark quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live near the beach</li>
            <li> I still tan at the tanning, but I am using this in conjunction with the bed because I live so far</li>
            <li> as long as you do it right with the mit</li>
            <li> This is why Fake Bakke gives an amazing tan, it goes pretty</li>
            <li> You can make yourself look incredibly sun-kissed without getting melanoma or wrinkles or becoming a disgusting dragon lady or spending $40 on a spray tan that lasts 7 - 10 days.</li>
            <li> As long as you moisturize well beforehand, this self tanner will apply so smoothly and it will last for days!</li>
            <li> I really like how this is applied with a glove instead of just spraying directly onto the skin, or a lotion that you rub with your bare hands.</li>
            <li> The Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, this is half the cost and with the added advantage of seeing color immediately.</li>
            <li> smell is great too, no more harsh chemical smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it really does dry more or less</li>
            <li> It withstands a few showers and doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easy.</li>
            <li> In my experience this product, used correctly, is the most realistic artificial tan available.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel this product gives you exactly what it promises, but a word to those with sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on my wrists after two applications (the first and second night</li>
            <li> No uneven lines popping up hours later;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that recently went on vacation to Miami and Vegas, and didn&#x27;t want to blind all the beautiful people with my winter paleness.</li>
            <li> If you have a medium-medium dark skin tone, go with the Fake Bake Flawless Darker.</li>
            <li> I always exfoliate and am super careful about putting on a pre-balm that helps to fight the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; around the ankles, hands, and elbows..</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t be the only one caught on the beach in the middle of July without a tan, no swirls no streaks, for a nice medium to dark tan, finally a product that really works !</li>
            <li> any color rinsing off when I shower, but the color improves after a shower, though I would definitely not hesitate to go anywhere after applying it (before showering), as it still looks pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really love how dark it gets you and instantly!!</li>
            <li> I was SO careful just to use it super sparingly and just pass over the knees and elbows to avoid staining and</li>
            <li> I have better results with Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion - Deep Dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one that needs to tan since I already have a dark complexion, but this really comes in handy when traveling in the winter months to hotter, tropical areas where my legs need a little help with evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell to it before you shower for the first time (like all sunless tanners) but this one is actually quite pleasant (especially compared to other products).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> The color that developed was very natural looking</li>
            <li> Now i have been using fake tanners for years and this is hands down the best  yet !!!</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s really intense, and easy to mess up.</li>
            <li> I love this product and they actually shipped it to me before it said it would be due!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that wants an easy cheap fake tan without looking like an ompa lumpa!</li>
            <li> Well, I have to take back a positive review that I submitted for this product a couple months ago...</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m usually very pale</li>
            <li> you are very pale, it may take up to four or five uses to get the color you desire, but this is ok for me, because I apply it in the morning until I get the color I want.</li>
            <li> It also makes a huge mess</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It got all over the sink, the wall, and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge mess too.  </li>
            <li> I have the applicator because it is mess free.</li>
            <li> This should take care of that minor leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone who used to frequent tanning beds in my 20&#x27;s and gave it up to avoid skin damage, I can attest to what looks like a natural golden UV tan vs. an orange monster from the tan-lagoon.</li>
            <li> My only con is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long and most of it will come off once you take a shower.  </li>
            <li> The first time I went too heavy on the knees, the second time, too light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That is really the only problem that I had with it, but to me it&#x27;s a pretty big problem!</li>
            <li> I also advise everyone to read as many tips as possible on application, trim the stem of the spray-bottle head about 1 1/2 inches prior to use to avoid leakage (it is way too long for the bottle), and wash the mitt after every</li>
            <li> This is much better then those lotions that you have to waste a lot of time rubbing it in, washing your hands every 15 seconds, and then not really knowing exactly where you put it.</li>
            <li> People complained about the straw being too long, but I trimmed a few inches off of mine and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> not bad like the other products.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of self-tanners because I am a pale redhead that burns easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird discoloration and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have used the bottle probably 6 times and there is still more than half left!</li>
            <li> 9- dry off lightly, moisturize entire body.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Fake Baker for two years now, which means I&#x27;ve used probably 20 bottles of this magic stuff.</li>
            <li> No streaking, had a very lightweight feel and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> It went on simply and quickly (taking me about ten minutes to apply it feet to head).</li>
            <li> The color also starts to fade much more quick than the fake bake lotion.  </li>
            <li> The straw on the spray attachment is way to long for the bottle so naturally the screw top doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough and the bottle will actually leak.</li>
            <li> My legs were too white for me to feel comfortable wearing a skirt, so what I do when I&#x27;m in too much of a hurry to do my whole body is rub some just on my legs after getting out of the shower (just a small amount)</li>
            <li> Be completely dry when you apply and don&#x27;t go do the dishes or something right away.</li>
            <li> Best fake tanner!!</li>
            <li> I sprayed the mit over the sink and no mess!</li>
            <li> One of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t have the bad odor associated with most self tans.</li>
            <li> The color is rich, and seems to last long.</li>
            <li> I use this pretty much every other day</li>
            <li> it dried so quickly!</li>
            <li> Only positive is that when you apply it you instantly have a little more color than you did before.</li>
            <li> Definitely more than I expected, i cannot believe I have been wasting my time and money paying for airbrush tans this long!!</li>
            <li> It can only be used in certain circumstances since it rubs off everywhere before the tan develops.</li>
            <li> On certain spots I had left over Loreal self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the spray attachment because I don&#x27;t think enough comes out at once to cover certain areas.  </li>
            <li> : ANY self tanner will sweat off after application, FakeBake is just smart enough to inform you that you should apply it at night so that doesn&#x27;t happen to you.</li>
            <li> Wherever the leak is coming from, it&#x27;s large enough for water to flow</li>
            <li> I have light skin and therefore am a little nervous about putting something on that screams self tan.</li>
            <li> Pretty much spread a (dark) towel out, sit and stand on it and spray on the mitt or directly on your skin and rub into your skin!</li>
            <li> I just wish I could find somewhere to buy the application mitts for cheap because they start to fall apart after a little while.</li>
            <li> I apply a little baby oil to these rougher areas after applying the bronzer to help smooth out.</li>
            <li> the mit is a little cheap  </li>
            <li> Make sure you are careful with your hands and dry spots!  </li>
            <li> I then had to clean the bathroom walls, wipe down everything and wash my bathroom</li>
            <li> - there are many products out there which achieve the same result with less effort - and no mess.</li>
            <li> My skin time is medium beige, i&#x27;m not pale</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not pale, but doesn&#x27;t make me look dark/fake either.  </li>
            <li> In Puerto Vallarta I wanted to look &#x27;poolish&#x27;, not pale and foolish.  </li>
            <li> I break out very easily and have used a small amount of this on my face (just whatever is left on the mitt when I&#x27;m done with my body)</li>
            <li> and they look a little muddy (absorbed too much product)</li>
            <li> If I want a little more color I apply a second coat to my legs after the am shower and wear the application all day at work then shower off when I get home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then a little more the next day.  </li>
            <li> The best fake tan for coloured skin and white skin and dry skin and scarred skin!</li>
            <li> and it is very realistic, but I would much rather it last longer than my next shower.</li>
            <li> I use it along with my other tanner for quick touch ups</li>
            <li> I think this needs applied more than one time per week which makes it hard to do if you lack the time.</li>
            <li> it is hard so for me an aerosol can  spray tan works better for me.  </li>
            <li> I worked my magic, and had The Hubbs help get the hard to reach areas (heehee.)  </li>
            <li> I slept with it on overnight, only a little bit rinsed off but left no streaks just a nice tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all as easy to apply as the original fake bake.</li>
            <li> It is hard to see on the back of your legs, but it goes on nicely with the glove.  </li>
            <li> And when you get your new bottle, switch the nozzles to the new bottle or cut the extra off on the new bottle.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake the best self tanner hands down !  </li>
            <li> And the only one that looks very Natural!!</li>
            <li> I works brilliantly and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not smell bad, it smells great!</li>
            <li> one is not so bad and not as messy.&lt;br /&gt;The color is better than the orange look so many give you.</li>
            <li> I have used a few self tanning products but none compare to this one, no more sun for me - this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> And out of the few brands of fake tan stuff I&#x27;ve tried this smells the best.</li>
            <li> I was really worried at first because it goes on really dark.</li>
            <li> I personally think that she could do without it, but it makes her happy and doesn&#x27;t look to fake.  </li>
            <li> this product is okay, not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> lol I was streaky and blotchy and will definitely go this Fake Bake route again.</li>
            <li> It sprayed on clear (just like water).</li>
            <li> You can clearly see where the product is going when you rub it on so</li>
            <li> The regular Fake Bake did a great job</li>
            <li> Now I am 20yrs old, and I do have sensitive skin on my face, however I would never consider that the skin on the rest of my body is sensitive.</li>
            <li> You really need to apply this at night and wash off the tint the next morning to reveal the natural color that is underneath it.  </li>
            <li> Fake bake is a great product, for a simple tan.</li>
            <li> You could see where I placed the sticker clear as day after I tanned</li>
            <li> Once the water ran clear, I exited the shower and used a towel to pat-dry my legs.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel extremely soft, and not sticky or itchy.</li>
            <li> SINCE I HAD NO NOZZLE I resorted to just pouring it directly on the mitt</li>
            <li> This stuff actually made me look like I had a real tan.</li>
            <li> Iook orange looks natural</li>
            <li> I prepped my skin by taking a shower and using dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar of soap.</li>
            <li> However, I developed a rash that began on my wrists, but extended all the way up my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> When I wake up and shower, the excess color DOES comes off, BUT it does leave a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with cautious optimism and looked at it for 3 months because in case 2,000 people lied, I didn&#x27;t really feel like buying Comet in bulk and the possibility of being housebound in oompa-loompa shame for several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural looking and not at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks completely natural and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Amazing, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> You just spray the tanner onto the provided soft mitt and rub it in.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> was white hahaha.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells and this does not bother me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking professional airbrush tan.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So applying it before you sleep really does help the product seep into your skin and thus last longer!</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply spray onto your mitt, which is included in your kit, but I applied it directly to my.skin, and just rubbed on a circular motion  </li>
            <li> The color looks so natural, but I did apply it 2 days in a row, because I wanted to have a darker color.</li>
            <li> It does not by any means look like i just came home from a tropical vacation, but it gives my skin natural color</li>
            <li> I cut the straw on the spray attachment to fit the bottle before I inserted it, and I had no problems with any sort of messy application.  </li>
            <li> I used the gloves, sprayed two sprays directly into the glove and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li> Looks really natural.  </li>
            <li> My least favorite tanner.</li>
            <li> One day early too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest of them all to apply with the mitt.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a tan without going to the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it by spraying it directly on the skin and by spraying it on the glove...</li>
            <li> and i looked like i had a natural tan.</li>
            <li> I spray directly onto the mitt and apply.</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan too.</li>
            <li> Natural tan look.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t want to get much darker than maybe after tonight&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;professional&#x27; mitt that it comes with starts flaking/shedding within a couple uses.</li>
            <li> It is so natural looking.  </li>
            <li> A tan so natural</li>
            <li> I am a 20 yr old guy and it has always taken a lot of sun to get my skin tan.</li>
            <li> I will be wearing a gown exposing my arms, back, shoulder, and chest ( not too much).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Similar to painting, if you get too eager and apply too much at once, you&#x27;ll develop streaks.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin when I&#x27;m tan, so I try to go for the natural brown and</li>
            <li> The combination of the gloves and mit completely prevents my hands from staining.</li>
            <li> It takes only about five minutes to apply over the whole body.</li>
            <li> It fades naturally, it has a bit of an odor, any tanner that claims it doesn&#x27;t is lying.  </li>
            <li> I am low key addicted to it because I don&#x27;t need to wear makeup anymore, and it doesnt cause cancer LOL.</li>
            <li> The tan looks natural and lasts.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural.</li>
            <li> so there were no uneven spots of color.</li>
            <li> If you follow basic self tanner 101 rules (exfoliate, bend elbows, etc), you should really like this too.</li>
            <li> Smells very tropical when I apply it, but 6 hours later</li>
            <li> I have to give it overnight to take action, then wash off the color guide before I want to be seen.</li>
            <li> and it gives you a natural color within minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned girl of Norwegian descent</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t believe me because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over real tanning.  </li>
            <li> this did not look natural.</li>
            <li> , this was far and away the easiest self tanner to apply.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite as natural as I thought</li>
            <li> it was absolutely natural looking.</li>
            <li> Plus this one bottle will probably last me through the whole summer</li>
            <li> It does rub off a bit on your clothes but it completely washes out.</li>
            <li> The color develops almost immediately and is a natural color, not orangy.  </li>
            <li> Goes on without streaking, looks natural, smells somewhat tropical.  </li>
            <li> Has a natural tan color, no orange color at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who does not want to lay in the sun for the natural tan.  </li>
            <li> this tanner mimicks my natural color after some sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times over about two months and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in what I received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times over about two months and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in what I received.</li>
            <li> My tan came out looking so natural</li>
            <li> also want to note, that this is a professional product and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> so I have to wonder why they didn&#x27;t just make both sides of the soft surface.  </li>
            <li> It looks SO natural on them both and never looks orange.</li>
            <li> This is a red based tanner which mimics a real tan, even for olive tones.</li>
            <li> I put this in my suitcase and it managed to get through two direct flights with no accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this looks natural on me.</li>
            <li> and this gave me a wonderfully natural, non-streaky color.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> (I think that means I&#x27;m a naturally orange-tan person?).</li>
            <li> The color fades like a natural tan would, no scales or patches.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> But so far I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to use tanning beds or a crappy self tanner that turns you orange.</li>
            <li> Not so much that you get no color, but enough that I need to use it three days in a row before I get the color</li>
            <li> Big and soaks up the pee without much odor</li>
            <li> Over all I do have young looking skin</li>
            <li> Gives that natural tan glow.</li>
            <li> the most common are your elbows, toes/ankles, wrists, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li> I also spray directly on my skin instead of on the mitt</li>
            <li> Looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a med/fair tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sprayed directly onto the skin then smoothed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> people say that it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that using this on your face is a breeze and thus far it hasn&#x27;t made my acne-prone skin break out at all.</li>
            <li> Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and had such high hopes for it based off all the reviews!</li>
            <li> I have some color in my skin naturally</li>
            <li> but I tend to get really pasty during the winter and this product totally solves my problem!</li>
            <li> If your sensitive to smells don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues.</li>
            <li> Looks totally natural and no tan lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You spray directly where you want the product then use the mit to apply in a streakless fashion.</li>
            <li> Natural glow</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering if this works, it does and it gives you a natural brown tan we all want to achieve.</li>
            <li> It says to use the soft side which I assumed was the brown side.</li>
            <li> I used the product on the brown side and ended up with completely brown fingers.</li>
            <li> The product was complete liquid.</li>
            <li> As a busy Mom of 3boys...</li>
            <li> My Korean mom used to call it \\&quot;shining\\&quot; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li> Product gives a natural tan, even after 1 application.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens Natural Glow (I like the face one</li>
            <li> I woke up and showered leaving a completely natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I got a bowl of sugar and took it to the shower prior to applying, mixing it with my soap and a wash cloth to exfoliate as you don&#x27;t want anything that contains oils to exfoliate because it will block the tanner from absorbing.</li>
            <li> Waited till that dried and sprayed the fake bake rubbed in and cont to spray alot more than I would have liked in hopes for some color.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, last a couple days.then</li>
            <li> So be aware of that if you&#x27;re taking a long trip.</li>
            <li> my fav sunless tanner thus far</li>
            <li> It has a very tropical scent, however eventually (an hour or two later), the stinky self-tanning scent emerges.  </li>
            <li> natural looking tan no orange looking skin.</li>
            <li> three girls at work tried it we were all pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> You can see the tan immediately and after a couple of applications, you will look as though you have been tanning naturally for months.</li>
            <li> But the darker color dosent look natural on me.</li>
            <li> This product gives me a natural tan that does not look orange.</li>
            <li> Looked amazingly natural.</li>
            <li> It lasts, it does not streak and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Back to the real tan for me.</li>
            <li> Looks natural on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray directly onto your body.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> do not look natural.</li>
            <li> My only caution is that you need to keep applying or the color fades fast.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of self tanners and so far this is number one on my list.</li>
            <li> It delivers really natural color that doesn&#x27;t flake or look orange.</li>
            <li> Leaves natural glow and&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t  </li>
            <li> It turns to a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wanna be one of those old ladies with leather for skin.</li>
            <li> The mitt helps it go on seamlessly.</li>
            <li> But the color on your skin is natural and the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li> I spray the tanner directly on my skin instead of on the mitt.  </li>
            <li> No heavy self tanner smell.  </li>
            <li> You look like you have a natural tan.</li>
            <li> Gives an even and natural glow</li>
            <li> It does not streak and looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> The color is natural looking &amp; not orange like some.  </li>
            <li> During your first shower you will notice some of the tanning spray wash off, but definitely not completely.</li>
            <li> so I wake up with a natural, bronze glow.  </li>
            <li> - I just spritz about 5 times directly onto the mitt for each arm, e.g.)</li>
            <li> - once I got to that point, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to touch up my color for nearly a week.</li>
            <li> Natural color.</li>
            <li> It looked like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> The color just didn&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li> The color is natural and bronze.</li>
            <li> Everyone is surprised when I tell them I use a self tanner because it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried these types of products before for weddings and the colors have never been natural</li>
            <li> natural looking tan, no orangy glow&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone that wants a self tanner that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> Only 1 person straight up looked me in the eye&#x27;s and said &amp;#34;Fake Bake?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in one day asked what product I used because it looked so natural.  </li>
            <li> Looks 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> I love the coconut smell - doesn&#x27;t have that icky sunless tanner smell they often have.</li>
            <li> This is closest to a real tan that I have come across in a topical application form.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve used all types of self tanning products...</li>
            <li> tan looks natural.</li>
            <li> I try to tan the old fashion way but living in the Pacific Northwest</li>
            <li> both give natural looking results.</li>
            <li> I marked off one star for the mitt.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural</li>
            <li> but once it dries it does not get on any clothing I have found so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It washes completely out of your sheets and clothes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t spray directly to the body (as it will color your floors)</li>
            <li> * Spray directly on mitt IN THE SINK</li>
            <li> : Take off the mitt, spray 1 or 2x directly to gloved palms, rub hands together and apply to face and ears.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;I do spray directly on my skin, and I have not have an \\&quot;orange\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li> It lasted me about a month of use and took about a week to 10 days to completely fade after I ran out.  </li>
            <li> She was so surprised the tan was from a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> once I feel it looks totally naturally</li>
            <li> and I actually have a real tan.</li>
            <li> The included plastic gloves and soft mitt makes application a breeze.  </li>
            <li> ; it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all..and</li>
            <li> Looks natural and lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;Billie</li>
            <li> The skin so soft helps with even application and absorption.</li>
            <li> before I applied this stuff I read the negative reviews and mostly said no color</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened the bottle to see it so runny and was concerned.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin so two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not a heavy Bath and Body Works coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> Even if you just get red it will really make</li>
            <li> In some places I did, spray directly on my legs and chest and then spread around.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You may very well need to use this self tanner daily.</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with that: maybe I would get a longer lasting tan if I sprayed a lot onto my skin versus the amount I use now, which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> it looks so natural and no one can believe it&#x27;s from a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every self tanner on the market, this one worked well.</li>
            <li> STAYS SOFT.</li>
            <li> ANYWAYS, I USE JERGENS NATURAL TANNER IN MEDIUM BEFORE I APPLY THIS, MAKES IT EASIER TO SPREAD, ALSO I SPRAY ON MY BODY NOT THE GLOVE.</li>
            <li> And it comes with a professional mitt that makes no streaks at all.</li>
            <li> NATURAL looking color (not even a tint of orange)</li>
            <li> I really like it overall</li>
            <li> /&gt;(30 years old, pasty irish/ northern Minnesotan skin tone)</li>
            <li> It washed away naturally</li>
            <li> This product works well and has a natural color.</li>
            <li> I recommend Jergens natural glow</li>
            <li> Smells like tropical bliss and absolutely none of that gross self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it requires a heck of a lot of work for the color your skin turns.  </li>
            <li> home mom, in my early 30&#x27;s with kids.</li>
            <li> It leaves no streaks at all and stays on for a considerable amount of time.</li>
            <li> my 6 year old son said, you look amazing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like that it has an instant bronzer (that acts as an indicator)</li>
            <li> but I found that the mit absorbs a lot of it before it reaches your skin, so it&#x27;s easiest to spray it directly onto your skin instead and then rub it in from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE</li>
            <li> sometimes spray directly on my body and then rub it in with the mitt.</li>
            <li> natural looking tan - doesn&#x27;t make you look orange</li>
            <li> It goes on effortlessly with the mitt...and Never streaky and just natural color results .</li>
            <li> I am verrrrrrry sensitive to smell and almost everything gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li> , It looks natural too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am 21 and was completely hooked on tanning beds from age 15..</li>
            <li> she was surprised how well the color looked.</li>
            <li> , I feel like if I really want to maintain a deep color I have to apply every two days.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I wish I had not wasted my money.</li>
            <li> No waiting until morning to have that natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> Oh, did I say natural looking?  </li>
            <li> Ive tried nearly every lotion and potion on the market to try and get a natural looking faux-tan</li>
            <li> Not blochy looks natural</li>
            <li> This product works so gradually that you have a chance to correct any areas that look too light or heavy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I am the lightest shade they make and this looks natural on me, not orange.</li>
            <li> The brown-ish guide paint stuff also adhered really well and didn&#x27;t come off until I showered the next day.  </li>
            <li> , I found this to be the easiest tanner to use so far</li>
            <li> This way my face is not uneven, and I can use my moisturizers and do my nightly routine with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And looks so natural</li>
            <li> The color it gives you is so natural and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d prefer it as a 1 complete product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for a younger person with darker features ( brunette) that has very moist skin...</li>
            <li> The mitt is soft, and I use it about twice before I just throw it in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> Not as natural as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the sensitive skin on my face can break out after using this,</li>
            <li> I spray it directly on my skin AND on the mitt and buff it evenly into any part of your body that you want to tan.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and sprayed it directly on the mitt provided.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural.</li>
            <li> so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I really wish you got a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> No streaks and the color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this, and would definitely refer and buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old with skin that has been weather in Florida for well......</li>
            <li> I am always going to the tanning beds, and pay $40 every two weeks for a tech to professionally spray me.</li>
            <li> The color looks natural and not orange-looking.</li>
            <li> The color is natural looking and not orange.</li>
            <li> I coat feet, hands and rough patches on my knees with moisturizer prior to Fake Bake to achieve perfect results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any streaks and it is a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I always use the  mitt and it produces a natural looking, non-streaky tan.</li>
            <li> and they have to be applied frequently to maintain it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking maybe I received an old product??</li>
            <li> It lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I used it and 2 days later, I noticed I was really itchy, could not figure out what caused it.</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I do now use it by spraying the solution directly onto the mit THEN rubbing it in to my skin</li>
            <li> So I guess until someone comes up with a monthly application I will have to just learn to deal with the frequent applications.  </li>
            <li> I am now over 30 years old and realize I need to stop using them</li>
            <li> Natural color, may not be</li>
            <li> but after I read the reviews on how natural the tan looks</li>
            <li> I had a natural brown tan, and when it began to fade</li>
            <li> I just sprayed directly on my skin and blended with the glove.  </li>
            <li> Really works, and a bottle last for a month or 2 of tans.</li>
            <li> This product has the conveience of doing it yourself at home but with the coverage of a professional spray application.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve showered, it looks really natural and not orange-y at all.</li>
            <li> 5- spray directly on arms, legs, body and rub in one section at a time.</li>
            <li> I actually look like I have a real tan, like</li>
            <li> (I could never achieve a tan naturally</li>
            <li> It gives a natural, brown glow.</li>
            <li> but after the shower in the morning every time I have used it I have been pleasantly surprised that every time it has come out even on my skin.</li>
            <li> No streaks , very even color , last about 6 times I used every 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone whos looking for a natural way to tan</li>
            <li> I thought the spray looked natural</li>
            <li> Naturally some color was lost in the shower the morning after</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about this product is that you can see the color instantly.</li>
            <li> The box came COMPLETELY torn up and everything was just stuffed in the box.</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> Blends into the skin well and looks really natural.</li>
            <li> Take long hot shower and exfoliate your skin  2.</li>
            <li> Have used on my chin to cover a spot too, but sparingly to blend in color, and still use the coloration liquid for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> no matter what I can&#x27;t get it to go on completely evenly.</li>
            <li> Not recommended;the product is not hypoallergenic so if you have a sensitive skin it could be a problem.</li>
            <li> she used a self-tanner,  because it looked so natural.  </li>
            <li> The tan looks so natural</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve already bought 4 bottles so far</li>
            <li> get compliments all the time on my tan and how natural it is.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it fades really fast</li>
            <li> my 10 year old asked what smelled like sunblock so...).</li>
            <li> I do not have an orange hue, but a natural bronze...</li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> Put an old sheet/towel on the floor before applying.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised about this product.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a very natural-looking tan and is a terrific price compared to getting a spray-tan at a salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a lot of work, when you don&#x27;t have naturally</li>
            <li> The color is so natural looking, I&#x27;m a bronzed beauty with this product.</li>
            <li> When I plan on wearing shorts/dress it, I apply this the night before because I&#x27;m very self-conscious about my white legs.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m at the ripe old age of 34.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t noticeable from far away</li>
            <li> Do not spray directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> does not make you look orange and works wonders on and around the foot area which is one of the hardest to look natural.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> The balm is like a wax, and you apply it after the tanner to blend the color, or before it to block it completely.</li>
            <li> today i did try a lil on my hand and so far i like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 6 times so far</li>
            <li> and I spray directly on the mitt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that looks so natural even around the feet and hands.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li> Natural look and none of the funky smell.  </li>
            <li> it gives you a natural tan look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what my natural skin color is anymore</li>
            <li> Unless the bottle is completely unopened.</li>
            <li> , I suspect it&#x27;s because I exfoliate it frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tan is natural to my color - looks</li>
            <li> and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not heavy or stinky.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times so far but am still getting the hang of the application.</li>
            <li> I can be really sensitive to alot of products.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> BUT THEN IT MAY NOT LOOK AS NATURAL OR LAY ON SKIN OR PORES</li>
            <li> I suggest this to anyone who wants an instant even all over tan!</li>
            <li> and I do not think organic or natural at all.</li>
            <li> just I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while and so natural..</li>
            <li> Natural color.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive either.</li>
            <li> And its still too early for laying out at the creek or the pool</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this enough - it really is foolproof.</li>
            <li> I think people look healthier with a modest dose of color on them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and mine is not longer soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray directly onto my body.</li>
            <li> Seeing all those patients having skin cancer surgeries and seeing so much prematurely aging skin scared the sense into me, and I am now a dilligent daily sunscreen user.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time if that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> The next day I applied it again at night, and the color once again looked good, but after showering again, I was left once again with blotchy, icky looking color.</li>
            <li> I love that it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and dried almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> I was too, but with such a low price it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I used it more than a few times to try to give it a second chance, and I even had my sister, who is a cosmetologist, and my mother, who is a licensed esthetician, apply the self tanner for me.</li>
            <li> Not a big drawback, as I should be following those golden rules regardless.</li>
            <li> my favorite for the past fews years has been Bare Essentials ...</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning sunkissed and golden and not even remotely orange.</li>
            <li> My issue is that it sinks into each and every hair follicle (on freshly shaved and exfoliated legs.)</li>
            <li> I feel like I finally found the best secret to staying tan all year round without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> SURE WY PEOPLE SAY ITS MESSY, I DIDNT GET IT ON ANYTHING, SIMPLY AIM AND SPRAY CLOSE</li>
            <li> The color was good, but it did not go on evenly and it sunk into my pores and made them look weird.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad at all either since it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, like tropical tanning lotion, not some weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is a good product</li>
            <li> Not perfect but good.</li>
            <li> decided to test drive this product this summer, before I go to Hawaii in the winter, to give myself time to find a good fake tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a good experience with Fake Bake products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for fake tans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it works the best if you already have a base tan,</li>
            <li> Even though the reviews were good, I was still skeptical ,as I am of any self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> It develops more slowly, but tends to stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and 57 and hav tried a variety of fake tans before.</li>
            <li> twins age 4 and a Sweet new little one of one month</li>
            <li> You may get a little pink on your light colored clothing or bedding, but it washes right out.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell (with little to no self-tanner smell that usually lingers hours after applying the product).</li>
            <li> Dries very fast, once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> have pretty pale skin and during the winter i can get pretty pasty</li>
            <li> the tan doesn&#x27;t last a super long time but it only takes me 5 minutes to apply it to my whole body evenly</li>
            <li> It was a mess to clean up and not with my time.</li>
            <li> I will probably go to the original during the summer when I am naturally tan and want to be a little darker.</li>
            <li> This provided me with an instant golden brown tan, it was easy to apply, very little odor, dries quickly &amp; lasts a few days!</li>
            <li> I also suggest having someone there to do your back because right now I have a big gap of space where I could not reach.</li>
            <li> It comes out super dark but looks so natural if you apply correctly.</li>
            <li> It goes on dark, evenly, dries quickly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL, NICE AND BROWN NOT SUPER DARK..</li>
            <li> Really though, i&#x27;ve purchased quite a few other tanners, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have zero patience and after the first application I noticed I have to take my time and be a little more thorough in coverage, as I did get a little streaky.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, you will have a hot mess!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy Fake Bake again, other than the bottle leaking, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to apply but worth it!</li>
            <li> Just more expensive, but that is probably due to better packaging.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer came right off and the amount was minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to let it sit on my hands for very long because they darkened the fastest even spraying the liquid on the glove first.</li>
            <li> Getting your skin wet in any other way (especially pools) will take it right off and make light spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works, doesn&#x27;t cost a ton like other brands &amp;#60;which is a huge plus to me!&amp;#62; I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> and it usually goes on really easily.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliate first, with a dry brush for example.  </li>
            <li> I bought the dry oil smoothie as well and apply to knees and elbows first.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to blend it in with your lotion and apply it that way or apply lotion first so it won&#x27;t instantly dry and streak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that much better than other self tanners I have tried.</li>
            <li> The spray and mitt don&#x27;t really do it for me, it was just a hot mess</li>
            <li> I was pretty much dry by the time I was done</li>
            <li> /&gt;Put a moisturizer on your knees &amp; elbows first, then let dry.</li>
            <li> It took me 1/10th the time to do a full body tan, compared my previous experiences.</li>
            <li> its a quick fix if u put some garnier bb cream in medium dark on when doing ur makeup.</li>
            <li> with this stuff it turns a super dark brown.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it wears off pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m crazy fair), quick dry time</li>
            <li> would be super dark.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything that made me look super dark.</li>
            <li> It does not give me that super dark look but</li>
            <li> Slight smell but not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to apply than the lotions or wipes, because you can pretty much see what and where it&#x27;s going at the time of application, you don&#x27;t get that next morning wake-up surprise, strips down your legs!  </li>
            <li> I have used the Banana Boat Deep Dark self-tanning lotion, which gives a nice tan, but I always had to wipe the excess off my toes, ankles, and heels, and no matter what time I applied it, I found that it would wear off unevenly while I slept through the night just from being in contact with the sheets and tossing and turning throughout the night, it would also collect in one area on my shin, which looked really patchy and orange.</li>
            <li> It only last about 3-4 days at the most, but I have to put it on about 3-4 days in a row just to get it to last that long and keep the color that I want.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is so easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t leave you skin smelling as self tanner which is something I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> You can clearly see a noticeable, yet subtle, layer of shading go over your skin that guides you to where you need to blend or apply more.</li>
            <li> It left me with a slight orange look and wasn&#x27;t that easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> Blue is the most coarse, green is medium, pink is mild coarseness.  </li>
            <li> Dry brushing thoroughly prior to entering the shower is also adequate exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very important to wash the mitt as well, the tanning product may cause it to dry weird (with the fibers standing up) and it isn&#x27;t a smooth application, plus a lot of the product remains in the mitt.</li>
            <li> I got this to help my extreme pale skin and it gave me a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is incredible and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants a natural looking fake bake.</li>
            <li> It is a little long and can cause oozing out of the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had a really great experience with Fake Bake the first time I tried it a few summers ago.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate, use barrier cream on your rough spots, apply in natural light and leave on as long as you can before rinsing</li>
            <li> I had no mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this wins over all ..</li>
            <li> ok, so all of the spray tans promise &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; results but seasoned shoppers are always skeptical, because (lets face it) there is nothing natural in a bottle of chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no mess.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake gives me a nice golden color, with no streaks as long as you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> Okay, just started using it, but am VERY PLEASED with the results, AND it&#x27;s stupid simple to apply.  </li>
            <li> You can not mess this up.</li>
            <li> No mess and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> If you do that, there&#x27;s no mess.  </li>
            <li> The red calms down and the end result color was fine.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my precious pale life!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to sit down for a little bit ( because I&#x27;m paranoid), but I could put clothes on like 5 minutes after application honestly.</li>
            <li> The others were aerosole and made a complete mess out of my entire bathroom, and the lotions I was more likely to get streaks or my palms and in between fingers all stained.</li>
            <li> I will say I had high hopes for this product, and I was let down, AT FIRST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a new fanatic on using Fake Bake Flawless tanning lotion no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and pretty much foolproof with the mitt and gives dramatic instant results.</li>
            <li> I found a much better product with longer lasting results, less smell and cheaper at the local Sally Beauty</li>
            <li> The big issue I have with this is that it washes off easily (even after 6 hours) leaving only minimal change in skin tone.</li>
            <li> One spritz per area gives me a subtle healthy glow.</li>
            <li> because taking some toilet paper and gently wiping my skin seemed to get them off without affecting the color.</li>
            <li> I wash it in hot water and then lay it out to dry!</li>
            <li> the backs of my ankles looked ridiculous :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using fake bake products and I love the fact that it has a color guide to show me the places I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens self tanning products in the past and think i will go back to that because it&#x27;s more gradual.  </li>
            <li> and I quit because I pretty much had to tan everyday</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the mitten fell apart first use and left brown residue all over body.</li>
            <li> In order to maintain a decent level of tan, I find myself applying this product daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;-I never trusted Original on my face due to the thickness and deep color it had.</li>
            <li> I Love it and would definitely recommend it to friends who are not able to go to a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> They literally are the same exact product I see 0 difference in any aspect of the product between the two besides it actually being darker.</li>
            <li> The tan begins to fade after the first shower, but I only noticed the fading after about 5 days from patches of color on my inner arm.</li>
            <li> And is such a decent price.</li>
            <li> you only have to apply once a week to maintain after the first initial days.</li>
            <li> Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 totally helped with the first goal, but that&#x27;s a totally separate review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im tan in places that usually don&#x27;t tan well, such as my face, and the color is totally believable without being streaky.</li>
            <li> There is no better product I have tried so many and have always come back to this formula</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky like the other self tanners.</li>
            <li> It is safe to say that I&#x27;m pretty much obsessed with this product...</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning sprays and lotions in the past, all of which left my streaked and orange.</li>
            <li> Fake bake flawless self tanner was the biggest waste of time of my life!</li>
            <li> Now I can tan, look natural and not dry out my skin!!!  </li>
            <li> The spray is super easy but a little messy!  </li>
            <li> (St. Moriz Dark Mousse), is that it is so easy to apply and dries so fast that as soon as I set down the bottle and wash the mitt, I can go get dressed.</li>
            <li> i opened it, used it for one application, closed everything off and by the morning the bottom of the box, and the top of the cap was soaked through, leaking down the bottle</li>
            <li> Also, it was easy to apply without blotches near my ankles, toes, or any other dry areas!</li>
            <li> However, like many people in the comments note, the product doesn&#x27;t last as long as other sunless tanners without maintenence.</li>
            <li> The color is instant and very natural (with no glitter)!</li>
            <li> They give you a cool little glove too, I&#x27;m assuming to slap people with</li>
            <li> It really digs into large pores, though, so it&#x27;s hard to apply to the face because you can&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> And unlike other sprays or foams, you see right away where the product has been applied so you can get an even coating.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who needs that extra glow!</li>
            <li> Even the high pressure beds with only UV-A rays are still damaging.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> With high chances of skin cancer in my family, this is the only way I will ever look tan!</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I would notice some color come off in the bottom of the shower, even the next day, so I avoided using it in high humidity</li>
            <li> For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually.</li>
            <li> For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> But overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I had such high hopes...crushed.</li>
            <li> Everyone still remembers that embarrassing day from back in high school when I showed up to school looking like an oompa loompa.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and works well, just doesn&#x27;t get very dark, even after multiple applications.</li>
            <li> so much so that I thought the new pink colored mitt was bleeding dye</li>
            <li> Who in their right mind wants to look green?!</li>
            <li> The only reasons that I would not give it 5 stars is because it rubs off very easily on clothing, sheets and towels long after it has dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Clings to pores like no other!</li>
            <li> Do NOT attempt to rub it in with bare hands!!</li>
            <li> After a few days it did start to rub off - but it was more when my skin was dry and got flaky, or if I exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> Self tanners concentrate more in dry areas with dead skin.</li>
            <li> spray the tan from a few inches away directly on my skin and quickly blend in circular motions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, nasty odor like most self-tanners, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and it lasts with a rich brown NOT orange color.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it was so watered down resulted in a unexpected spill  ALL over the floor (ran right off the mitt) .</li>
            <li> I am a VERY pale woman who has tried many different self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I have very pale, fair skin with trouble tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked at a tanning salon and gotten free mystic sprays for the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I tan, but it takes a long time, and I never get very tan unless I spend a ton of time in the sun (which I refuse to do).  </li>
            <li> The color looks so real and stays for long.</li>
            <li> it went on fast 15 minuits and two hours later I was actually looking like I had a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It deepens your color instantly, its mess free with the provided mitt, and it fades evenly.</li>
            <li> And the whole bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is great for an instant tan and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> You will notice that its much too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> someone that usually uses light tanners is used to.</li>
            <li> I suspect it does not matter as long as you apply evenly all over, and very well on knees, feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so depending how much comes off I will reapply and see how long the color lasts.</li>
            <li> The next day it does begin to have the normal self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Gave me the bronzed look I would get normally by laying out after several weeks.</li>
            <li> but I am not dark.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different spray tans, with moderate success.</li>
            <li> I am Greek and normally have medium tone skin</li>
            <li> For reference i am NC40-42 in mac which is not a dark skintone to beging with.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s tailored to my exact skin tone because I look the way I do after I&#x27;ve spent a week at the beach (without the sunburn)</li>
            <li> It can rub off on clothes until your first shower, so be careful.</li>
            <li> No dark spots,</li>
            <li> Later when you shower it off you&#x27;ll still have some color but not as dark as you originally applied it.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it the smell is not intense but after sleeping in it over night it is smelly.</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly not as dark as I hoped but still the smoothness and evenness makes up for it.</li>
            <li> At first this was extremely alarming...</li>
            <li> then I am back to my normal color.</li>
            <li> I was careful putting this for the first time</li>
            <li> Lastly: after the other night i sprayed only my legs: most of it washed off the next day</li>
            <li> I put this on and yes, compared to a normal person I am still white</li>
            <li> its not crazy dark</li>
            <li> The mitt itself is poor quality and has a soft side which you spray the tanning formula onto and a rough side which does not feel good against your skin.  </li>
            <li> But no matter how good the product, a fake tan never hides the flaws or glows from deep within the skin like a natural tan</li>
            <li> have been using different tanning products for years, everything from L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (which I was vaguely favorable to), MysticTan, VersaSpa (good in a crunch, but not at the eleventh hour), and Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
            <li> It even looks natural if you are super pale.  </li>
            <li> This was a watered down version of what I have used in the past, and love!</li>
            <li> I had to travel for wedding, and I took the advise of other users when I received it and cut the pump tube down to the appropriate length for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Overall, good for winter if you are pale, but any other time I feel it would not be enough.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of lasting color, I&#x27;m not as ghostly pale as before I use it, but I was hoping it would last more than</li>
            <li> when applying it is not that dark so as you rub it in you can&#x27;t tell where you have missed or applied too much to one particular area</li>
            <li> I just took so paper towel and wiped on my arms to get the rest of the initial color dried off and everything was fine.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend exfoliating first and applying small layers daily instead of too much at one time.</li>
            <li> I kept going back over certain areas thinking that I didn&#x27;t get enough coverage, then I thought,</li>
            <li> mit is a little flimsy and cheap and it&#x27;s starting to fray a bit after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it for a little extra color.</li>
            <li> &quot; after it&#x27;s been on my skin for a little while, but fake-bake has the most minimal \\&quot;self-tanner smell\\&quot; of any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However, it is hard to apply to the face with that large mitt, and it definitely makes the pores more noticeable - need to include a smaller facial applier!  </li>
            <li> I do not tan simply because I prefer to keep my skin cancer and wrinkle free as long as possible, especially since skin cancer runs in the family</li>
            <li> This is instant, which I love, and if you go dark enough it will last about 6 days.  </li>
            <li> Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.  </li>
            <li> I love the color before you wash it off, but could hardly tell I applied anything after showering...and that&#x27;s after leaving it on overnight and applying it several times.</li>
            <li> Self tanners really have come a long way!</li>
            <li> Another important fact, why air brush your entire body for an event if you are not going to a pool party or other event where you are not exposing your entire body.</li>
            <li> I received the new package the very next day.</li>
            <li> So you get a new mitt every time you buy this product and the mitt lasts through the use of the entire 6 ounces.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California, so</li>
            <li> my beingwhite is only a concern when I travel out of where I live.</li>
            <li> it didnt transfer onto my new white sheets either!!!</li>
            <li> I became concerned about using tanning beds and live in a rural area</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be that I did not like the way it went on my hands, however I am new to using this</li>
            <li> Its def something buildable not a golden tan right away</li>
            <li> I have used tanning booths, every self tanner on the market, and expensive salon sprays, and this offers amazing results.</li>
            <li> The only fake tan I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my porcelain skin bright orange.</li>
            <li> Not Loving it so far-&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to put on for even coverage.  </li>
            <li> Once dry, it doesn&#x27;t really rub off or streak either..</li>
            <li> the tanner is dry on my whole body I get dressed in my pjs and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> (shower, dry off really well, lotion elbows, sides of feet, palms, and exfoliate).</li>
            <li> Because this is not a lotion, you need to be very mindful of exfoliating and applying lotion to dry areas-</li>
            <li> and I tan easily but don&#x27;t want the negative effects of UV rays.</li>
            <li> It was easy application and my tan was tan not the least bit orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last long after using it the first week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the included blue gloves, and really don&#x27;t think they are necessary.</li>
            <li> Do several light coats over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After finally outgrowing the need for a damaging real tan, I have tried numerous sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li> It really is a 2 person job, especially for your back.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long, and if you keep reapplying, obviously, lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really fond of this product mine was very liquidy and messy..</li>
            <li> The mitt that comes with this and the fast drying formula makes it possible to have an all over body tan in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Well I ordered this like normal and the first thing I noticed was 2 things were missing.</li>
            <li> I really like the color this gives, but I will not repurchase, since I had to religiously apply, since it does not seem to last.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that it didn&#x27;t really work on my stomach or lower back?</li>
            <li> As of now I am using it about once a week to maintain a light color, but may try a few coats later in the summer for a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish there was more product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I actually much prefer the type of tan I get from this product over the occasional spray tans I get at a local spa/salon.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, as long as you exfoliate properly, this gives you a pretty all over tan.  </li>
            <li> I am a regular spray tanner which will last so much longer.  </li>
            <li> * Gently pat the mitt on the back of hands and wrists then rub back of hands together.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to moisturize on days you arent using fake bake, it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of lotions and creams of all sorts, but all got me itching like a maniac by the end of the day (sometimes even the hour), and didn&#x27;t work for me that much in terms of an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As the day wore on it developed that same old self-tanner smell (maybe it is just a &#x27;skin-turning-darker&#x27; smell?).</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the simple fact that it tans you instantly and does not rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m not happy and will continue my search for a more natural tanner.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that most washes off after one shower and all off within 2-3 showers.</li>
            <li> I does last a pretty long time, too.  </li>
            <li> It does rub off on clothes some (even after showering), so do not wear white or a light color a few days after.</li>
            <li> When they got stained, I noticed that the stains were more red than orange, which is why it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a carrot, in my opinion at least.</li>
            <li> It does occasionally come out splotchy, which you can really see when you go outside.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the spray ones though since that allows me to spray my back, and this doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never quite sure how much to spray on the mitt and it&#x27;s difficult to not get streaks when rubbing in the product.  </li>
            <li> I just received this today and I tested it out on my stomach and it dried quickly I did everything correctly.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly.</li>
            <li> do love the color this gives my skin, although i prefer the results of St. Tropez more (note: I do not prefer the smell, annoying transfer to all clothes and anything you touch, etc, of St. Tropez</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from a pasty white family line, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good fake tan that won&#x27;t make me look like an oompa-loompa.  </li>
            <li> - Tanner color is only good when it&#x27;s even, and this my friend, is the catch with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it staining clothes after it has dried.</li>
            <li> This is my second summer using this product and I will recommend it to everyone looking for a good fake tanner.</li>
            <li> I do wish the initial application lasted a bit longer, but it was easy enough to apply and I don&#x27;t mind doing a couple of applications to get a good base tan.</li>
            <li> and it is strong, but at least you won&#x27;t smell like your skin is burning.</li>
            <li> You may want to place a towel down when you spray it because it does get on floors and walls but wipes right up.</li>
            <li> You may want to place a towel down when you spray it because it does get on floors and walls but wipes right up.</li>
            <li> I got the same amazing results and it wasn&#x27;t near as expensive as the professional spray liquid my machine takes!</li>
            <li> The color is very natural, even for a pale-skinned redhead such as myself.  </li>
            <li> I am left with a very natural tan.</li>
            <li> The color left is very natural for me &amp; if you end up with mistakes, you can apply another coat to even it out.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to reach everywhere on your back but the glove does help to reach more than you would with bare hands.</li>
            <li> She was also a blonde hair, blue-eyed, pale girl and had a fabulous tan.</li>
            <li> You really cant reapply with the same coverage as the initial application because as you wash it and as the days do by it wears harder in certain areas than others.</li>
            <li> always need two major exfoliation days to get the leftovers of a spray tan off.</li>
            <li> One major tip....</li>
            <li> And you end up with a lovely bronze tan that looks like you spent a weekend on a beach...not too dark, but definitely a noticeable medium shade tan.  </li>
            <li> I mean I can&#x27;t hold color on a trip to Hawaii for more than two weeks white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that any changes in skin texture such as stretch marks or surgical scars take the pigment differently and also fade at a different rate.</li>
            <li> No other product has EVER worked for me.</li>
            <li> No other enhancements needed.</li>
            <li> This is my first self tanner ive ever used , so im not exactly an expert with the stuff.</li>
            <li> After such unexpected results for him I had to put it on me!</li>
            <li> I had several people comment on my tan that it was natural!</li>
            <li> This works as well, if not better than most of the more expensive sunless tanners that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have had no other problems with this product.  </li>
            <li> I look like a totally different person with a natural glow!</li>
            <li> I think its worth the price and something ill be using all winter long :)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews (first one was extremely helpful)</li>
            <li> But you HAVE TO take a shower before going out because if anything should splash on you, even if you wash your hands, it leaves major splash marks and streaks.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to not spray too close to the skin as it will make it more difficult to spread and will leave a small dot stain on the skin.</li>
            <li> decided that I would first tan only my legs, in case it became streaky or orange on my white skin with red undertones.</li>
            <li> the color payoff was seldom and the itching was major.</li>
            <li> The color, while not orangey, was very light and wore off oddly in my joints (which is typical of self-tanners</li>
            <li> It seems as though this product was designed for peach toned and super pale people.    </li>
            <li> I am someone who is super pale.</li>
            <li> I am super pale, work night shift and needed something to make me look not so washed out.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for mine and a friends super pale legs.</li>
            <li> I am super pale</li>
            <li> (the bottom of my forearms are super pale</li>
            <li> Also, I am super pale, when I go to the makeup counter</li>
            <li> This self tanner washes off so quickly, I would say in about 2-3 days; and it is quite orange against my extremely pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am super pale (redhead).</li>
            <li> (Mind you I&#x27;m super pale).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is happening but it does leak on me and the spritzer could definetly be upgraded bc although the application process is simple and easy</li>
            <li> Small amount does transfer to clothing, but easily washes out in regular wash cycle&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different sunless tanners and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> After the first time using this, I followed the instruction, exfoliated really well, applied evenly, and not only did it streak, but it left really dark spots in my pores.</li>
            <li> this twice in a day is fine but don&#x27;t use to much, a little goes a long</li>
            <li> Fake Bake makes high quality, affordable tanning products that are just as good as the other high-end tanners on the market.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews (the Baiden mitten too) and I am happy to say I will never again pay for an expensive spray tan at the salon.  </li>
            <li> St. Tropez Tanning Mousse (this used to be my favorite), Banana Boat, L&#x27;Oreal, the tanning towelettes (Kate Sommerville and a few other brands), etc.  </li>
            <li> Does NOT turn you orange, the tan lasts without extreme maintenance and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do a full body application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it on super dark, so it&#x27;s lasted a long while for me, nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> I spent my younger years in the tanning beds and with the proper tanning lotions, i&#x27;d get an adequate color</li>
            <li> Overall it was defiantly worth the money I spent for it!</li>
            <li> This one is not very dark.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not very dark if you use it alone but</li>
            <li> I use jergens  natural glow to spruce up my tan about mid-week (just on my legs as this part always seems to take less color) and my tan lasts normally five to seven days before I actually b do the whole process again.</li>
            <li> it leaves little brown lint balls all stuck to your freshly applied lotion.</li>
            <li> The color that develops before shower is a little brown, but washes off into a golden undertone tan.</li>
            <li> seriously the best fake tanning stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The more often I use it, the less &amp; less I like it.  </li>
            <li> I know the box says you&#x27;ll get darker with more applications, but I only see subtle changes each time.  </li>
            <li> Definitely keep your buff clean though and rinse after each use to prevent it from staining or from getting green.</li>
            <li> he shower, put it on, and sleep in black pants and black shirt on a brown blanket on top of my bed.</li>
            <li> Living in an area that doesn&#x27;t get that much sun, I&#x27;ve found this looks realistic, and I wear it almost all year round except for the summer months when the sun comes out.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t wipe it up quick enough, it might leave a slight stain.</li>
            <li> This is the most realistic looking fake tan I&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
            <li> Spray tanning at a salon was always a hassle with the long wait, the high cost, and it rubbing off on everything.</li>
            <li> It is a very dark tan and looks natural but, still cakes up in spots where you need a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I missed my dark tan from last summer, but as I&#x27;m getting older and wiser (haha)</li>
            <li> Totally reminds me of how the actual sun would tan me so it looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub it on hard just smooth it on.</li>
            <li> You can wear white right after you have applied this and not worry about it turning your clothes brown like other products.  </li>
            <li> My other tip is- don&#x27;t wear white right afterwards.</li>
            <li> This also depends highly on your skin undertones, if you have yellow, brown or red undertones this product will work well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super dark, it just looks like I spent some time by the pool (very natural looking).</li>
            <li> Less mess and more even tan.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are right -- snip the spray tube before trying to use it because it&#x27;s far too long and will make the bottle leak.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the fact that it tends to wash off a little too fast, but then again, there&#x27;s still a lot of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; left after the first wash.</li>
            <li> (and by spray I mean spraying the buffing pad and applying it to the skin) Respraying your arms and legs is fine however.&lt;br /&gt;-Try</li>
            <li> first application resulted in some slight streaking on the thighs, but that was more due to uneven application.  </li>
            <li> my pale skin thanks you!!</li>
            <li> Plus I know how bad the sun is for you, so I decided to try this after reading some of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells great and never smells bad, and I&#x27;ve barely had streaks because I&#x27;ve used the glove and blended in circles</li>
            <li> Anyone who is thinking about buying this, i suggest you do you will be shocked how great the results are.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t generally remember at night</li>
            <li> So the general advice is keep it away from the eyes and don&#x27;t inhale it.</li>
            <li> The tan lasts generally about a week for me</li>
            <li> i generally shave it now before i tan cause it is disproportionate to the rest of my face in regards to the shade i end up with.</li>
            <li> generally anywhere that&#x27;s &amp;#34;bony&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tan barely shows up and washes off almost completely the next day.</li>
            <li> It always looks really even, not splotchy, even when I&#x27;m being lazy and apply it without much attention.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell how long the color lasts as I am outside every afternoon but even if I have to use it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tan overnight because self tanners or even lotions make me too hot to sleep comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I will be more careful from now on but this small problem doesn&#x27;t take away from my opinion 😊  </li>
            <li> Until the first time you shower, Fake Bake can transfer onto your light colored clothes or sheets.</li>
            <li> Just so I am clear, I put this on the day before, around 1pm in the afternoon and didn&#x27;t shower until the next morning.</li>
            <li> It went on in a light thin layer not thick and sticky like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The next morning I&#x27;ll rinse and can clearly see the stain coming</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin and have feared the streakiness that self tanners normally leave behind, not to mention the horrid orange tint..</li>
            <li> Your skin actually feels moisterized and soft when you wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> apparently some of the chemicals in it aren&#x27;t that great….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shower daily though since I workout daily, even with using only my hand and a gentle soap the color washes off in one to two showers.</li>
            <li> This must be a really intense product if you need that minimal amount during the application!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Directly sprayed 6 times to my upper arm, 4 to the lower, etc.</li>
            <li> I can barely tan in the sun at all</li>
            <li> Natural tan instantly!</li>
            <li> I am only 17 years old and have already had skin cancer scares.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and have recently quit going to the tanning beds to save my skin.</li>
            <li> You barely smell anything</li>
            <li> I would never go out in public directly after applying it</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old female.</li>
            <li> Will I keep buying this - yes because I feel like the ease of application and the natural color I get outweighs the short staying power.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up, I shower it off and am left with a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The color is natural and looks like you just got back from a beach trip.  </li>
            <li> Some of them turn me orange, some are streaky, and some have barely any color payoff.</li>
            <li> This morning I was curious to see how much color would come off</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how beautifully naturally tan</li>
            <li> The next day, after the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; set in, I was blown away by how natural and brown it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I frequently travel and I simply refuse to hit the beach/pool without some color.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Looks and fades completely natural if taken proper care</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and Cosmetologist, and this product sells on Amazon for the same price I can get it at a professional beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It did get me pretty dark.</li>
            <li> The tan is natural and not yellow.</li>
            <li> It gave me an instant bronze natural color.&lt;br /&gt;Inside</li>
            <li> In the early evening, I took a shower so the guide did wash out, which resulted in a lighter version of the above mentioned, but still,</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first because my one ankle looked really dark...</li>
            <li> Will not transfer to clothing and lasts several days with natural tan look.  </li>
            <li> Still went on streaky even with glove and following directions to not spray directly to skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the dark color when you first spray it on</li>
            <li> currently done w/my tanning for the year and have allowed this to wash off completely</li>
            <li> I get compliments daily as this product looks bronzed and natural.</li>
            <li> I can say this product produces a natural looking tan and darkens well over multiple applications.</li>
            <li> the next morning my 4year old got into my bed to watch a movie  with me</li>
            <li> and I have a yellow hint to my skin naturally that everything turned me orange.</li>
            <li> It gives such a natural tan that does not leave you orange at all.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m a busy mother of 3 children, and don&#x27;t have an immense amount of time to fiddle with application, drying, etc.</li>
            <li> but I used my bare hands to apply.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as apparent as some others that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after a shower, go to sleep on my white sheets and so far haven&#x27;t seen any stains.</li>
            <li> Following so far?  </li>
            <li> and I stay pretty dark.</li>
            <li> The instant color it gives is natural enough to go out in during the day, and the color that stays after you shower is really natural as well.</li>
            <li> But, I have barely made a dent in that six ounces.</li>
            <li> After I took a shower the next morning the color was completely gone like I didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> It takes about a week to completely wash off if you only used it one day.</li>
            <li> the only time i sprayed on the mitt instead of my skin directly is when I used it on my face, the backs of my hands, and my feet.</li>
            <li> The color is so natural and was almost instant.  </li>
            <li> It can streak your skin if you are not careful though.</li>
            <li> never expected a sunless tanner to be so convenient</li>
            <li> but it barely gave me a tan</li>
            <li> ( i am Irish with naturally platinum hair).</li>
            <li> i sprayed onto the mit for my face, neck, chest and back but sprayed directly onto my tummy, arms and legs and then blended.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I am going to wait for it to fade completely before reapplying in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I think I want a bit darker (especially on my legs which were naturally lighter than my arms</li>
            <li> You MUST be careful with the application, too much will make you orange.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting on your swimsuit and applying OUTSIDE in natural daylight.</li>
            <li> The tan last and skin looks natural.</li>
            <li> It is totally even and looks natural.</li>
            <li> When it started to fade away, it seemed to just grab to my pores and those rough patches -- leaving me straight up orange when I decided to wean off the product.</li>
            <li> But Barely.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty dark.</li>
            <li> The color is instant, gradual and natural looking.</li>
            <li> and yes, all ovet my bare feet  </li>
            <li> When you first put the tanner on it is dark in color and applies evenly.</li>
            <li> I waited until the next morning to take a shower, and it did stain my clothes, but I wore old clothes (the videos said it would</li>
            <li> I like the dark tone they provide, but it can be pretty orange</li>
            <li> I used this so far a total of 6 times.</li>
            <li> I barely touch the mitt to these areas and I still can end up with orange spots if not careful.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, I was horrified to see that I was getting all these dark blotches all over my face.</li>
            <li> I might actually have achieved the colour naturally</li>
            <li> I need to do 2 or 3 days straight of it to get the darkness I want, but then it only last for about 2 days after (with daily showering).</li>
            <li> i could barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> were practically bare.</li>
            <li> Works very well but be careful when you put in on your hands and feet</li>
            <li> I use this 2 times per week to keep a constant natural glow.</li>
            <li> In getting ready for a friends wedding, I realized how pasty I was, and that I had absolutely no time to tan.</li>
            <li> It did turn me really dark at first, but it was the guide color.</li>
            <li> This is the only self tan product or professional spray tan</li>
            <li> my 2nd purchase so far.</li>
            <li> the nozzle never stopped working.i already bought my second bottle.best product ive tried so far.</li>
            <li> I am pretty dark already, but have psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon after using Bare Minerals Faux Tan for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It is the only product I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, and looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper than getting spray tanned professionally</li>
            <li> I simply showered and used my normal loofah with a gritty body wash.</li>
            <li> I wish the guide color wasn&#x27;t so dark and obvious, but worth it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly- even with the replaced bottle and pretty wide</li>
            <li> no real dark on my knees or ankles, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved being tan but knew that bed tanning was dangerous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and the smell always nauseated me.</li>
            <li> It is completely streak free, doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes because it dries fast, and you don&#x27;t smell weird after its settled in.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice tan without looking fake.  </li>
            <li> I know Fake Bake makes their own exfoliant, but I have never tried it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, not orangey or fake looking.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not great.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think ill even try it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice that I didn&#x27;t have to shower twice in an hour like with 60 min fake bake.</li>
            <li> The formula is better than any $$$ product I have used, but the bottle is so poorly executed I can not recommend.</li>
            <li> However, Fake Bake has a nice coconut smell when it is applied but you will notice after three or four hours that it will start to smell like self tanner.</li>
            <li> And even worse, it still smelled more than 24 hours and 2 showers</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t stepped into a tanning bed in a 2 years &amp; I was missing that golden brown tan.</li>
            <li> I also use the Fake Bake Body Passion Fruit Body Polish beforehand, to give my skin a nice scrub.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better self-tanners I&#x27;ve used, but even so, I still ended up with those dark spots &amp; streaks of uneven tanning.</li>
            <li> A few things that I have noticed that are worth mentioning...</li>
            <li> this is awfully complicated even though the color is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously - if you like a nice fake glow, this is it.</li>
            <li> Has a little bronzer if you need some tan right away.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be leaking right out of the nozzle itself - the little hole the product comes out of.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it does rub off onto white sheets and light colored clothing occasionally (and the towels you lay down before application will look ruined), but WILL wash out.</li>
            <li> this tanner give you awesome color if you don&#x27;t want to be 2 dark and it doesn&#x27;t streak until you get down on the end of the bottle which is weird</li>
            <li> I just looked down when I first got in and the water turned brown.  </li>
            <li> but after a few days I turn right back to my normal white color.</li>
            <li> The only major problem is I have to apply every other day or so or the color fades FAST!</li>
            <li> Easy deep dark long lasting tan with out the Sun!</li>
            <li> For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately.</li>
            <li> For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately.</li>
            <li> Buying my second bottle soon (yes it really lasts that long!)</li>
            <li> The color is very realistic, but I found myself having to apply it every other day to maintain a descent tan.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that it smelled or rubbed off on my clothes (as long as I let it dry completely before dressing), and I did really like the color that it gave me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lily white Irish girl who used to live in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pale, but this self tanner has achieved a golden bronze tan that all of my friends compliment.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and very little smell and</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after exfolating as it said let it dry very well before dressing and the next day for</li>
            <li> It also appears that you might be able to layer this product on after the previous layer has dried</li>
            <li> (As others said) It gets Messy, Try to find a spray nozzle that is less spritzy and more guided.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to apply, dried quickly, and left a gorgeous brown color rather than a nasty orange.</li>
            <li> Beware heavy application on your face; that&#x27;s the one place where less is more.</li>
            <li> Like i said it gives you an instant bronze tan, looks very natural, but used a different lighter tan lotion for face.</li>
            <li> It dries immediately, and is very natural looking, lasts several days before reapplying is necessary.</li>
            <li> I wish I new about this product long time ago.</li>
            <li> So to maintain a consistent look you must put this on every single day, and if your not naturally tan at all, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it dried right away</li>
            <li> but it smelled pretty blah to me, slightly of coconut</li>
            <li> I find that I use less product if I don&#x27;t spray the product on the mit first.</li>
            <li> me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never splotches, never streaks, comes off pretty evenly after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I previously used Tan Towels but always felt like the result was pretty orangey.</li>
            <li> , i was slightly orange the first day</li>
            <li> Where I used to have to carefully apply lotion, wash my hands a million times, and stand around naked waiting to dry, now I quickly apply this and immediately go get dressed.</li>
            <li> have used other self tanning products in the past, Kheils is still my favorite</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have white towels - which now have lovely orange streaks on them from the tanner that didn&#x27;t come off despite lots of soap and scrubbing!  </li>
            <li> and you can always use a little more and get a little darker.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles of Fake bake and love this product!</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past and love this one.  </li>
            <li> This self-tanner produces more of a bronze color vs the orange color I usually develop with other products.</li>
            <li> I say this because my first time I didn&#x27;t do this as a total airhead and went up one leg, and then found myself leaning against the leg I had just done to do the other.</li>
            <li> it was much less scented and dried super fast - like, 3 minutes</li>
            <li> If not completely dry it will rub off on clothes or streak in the rain!</li>
            <li> It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li> It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li> It very faintly resembles the scent of other self tanners however, the color is a rich golden, leaps &amp; bounds better looking than other tanners!</li>
            <li> at first it smelled very nice like cocoanut but after 20 minutes it started to smell very bad</li>
            <li> This product if used properly does not even look like a fake tan it goes on smoothly and blends very very well to where I had people asking me where I went tanning at.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is that most of the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; washes off during your next shower so I have to reapply several times a week.</li>
            <li> My family has a super high number of people with skin cancer throughout, and I am less and less charmed with the idea of being in a tanning bed three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my second favorite it the neutrogena micromist in &#x27;dark&#x27;, but it just isnt quite dark enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I put the mit on and noticed right away that it was not the same quality--the foam felt less dense than the Ulta mit.</li>
            <li> It was not near as strong as most of the fake tanners, but I could still smell it, I used a little perfume to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> If your skin is really dry, or even remotely dry use lotion first.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and on the dry areas it was super dark, and the oilier areas no color.</li>
            <li> I skip the applicator mit (if you use it, be sure to wear a glove inside of it or you&#x27;ll be sorry) and use an extra large flat kabuki brush to buff on the color.</li>
            <li> Application was certainly much easier than any other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t orangey, but it does come out patchy in a lot of places due to the contours of your body and the fast drying time.</li>
            <li> I really doubted it would work, I&#x27;d forgotten about it, found it the other day and OMGOSH.</li>
            <li> With as much as you&#x27;ll spend on other tanners, give it a try.</li>
            <li> would buy again its just as the picture and description and cheaper than buying at Sephora or other beauty stores thanks A+++</li>
            <li> A co-worker mentioned this product and I really was sold on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in place by putting a rubber band around my wrist, but that really doesn&#x27;t work all that well, and it&#x27;s an inconvenience when it&#x27;s time to switch everything over to using the other hand.</li>
            <li> I find my face and chest seems to fade much faster then other parts</li>
            <li> I really love this product already, I have been using it for a little over a week now, almost everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Fades a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;d say you couldn&#x27;t go for more than a few days/a week without re-applying&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely not dark or long-lasting enough to use alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT...it&#x27;s not dark enough and my husband says that he can&#x27;t even tell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not dark enough.</li>
            <li> I know a long review is annoying, but I can not stress enough how AWESOME this product is!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is probably because of how hard I&#x27;m pressing this over my skin and you really have to apply pressure because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up streaky because this product dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Not smelly, get you dark very fast and dry very fast too compare to other sunless tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I rinse it thoroughly and allow it to air dry before putting it away, and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> I cannot find for a decent price, so after a few attempts this year with new products I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I have used California Tan Bronzing spray ONLY for the last year, so I was nervous about trying a new and different product.</li>
            <li> I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later.</li>
            <li> I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d quit because I really didn&#x27;t think it was good for my skin and had been pale for about 6 months, plus it really was time consuming and a little expensive.</li>
            <li> but I tend to like a more dramatic bronze.</li>
            <li> Super natural and subtle, and no streaks whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy, and increases with daily use ( but not to a ridiculous color).  </li>
            <li> However, my only complaint is that it tends to slide off your hand easily if you don&#x27;t keep your fingers spread inside the mitt to hold it in place, but no big deal there.</li>
            <li> this is the lazy tanner&#x27;s DREAM), and easy to smell (because all self-tanners know the usual tanner &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; is really leaving something to be desired).  </li>
            <li> and it really does dry quickly enough so that you can get dressed in about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it will seem unnaturally dark but that&#x27;s the initial color.</li>
            <li> My favorite fake tan product so far.</li>
            <li> If I can think far enough ahead, I like to apply it the day prior to the day where I&#x27;ll be exposing my legs -</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the most natural tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The squirt top does leak and gets messy, even after I cut a half inch off the tubing, havent found a fix for that, and thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> It leaves a great and natural olive color, and is idiot proof in application.  </li>
            <li> It will come off on your clothes if not completely dry &amp;</li>
            <li> I tried the Fake Bake Lotion last year, and really liked the results.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and then I applied a 2nd coat the next morning.  </li>
            <li> You must be careful not to get smears, but it is a realistic color of reddish &amp;#34;tan,&amp;#34; not orange.</li>
            <li> I even watched several demonstrations on YouTube, so I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Well worth every little penny that this bottle costs!</li>
            <li> It will turn your face very dark very fast.  </li>
            <li> Very easy application, can&#x27;t go wrong with the spray and mitt.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li> But throughout the day it started to smell a little (it was hot too)</li>
            <li> an I put a little on first to see how it would tur out</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I was a little splotchy but</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it for the first time when you have somewhere you need to be as it takes a little while to figure out the technique and work out the kinks.</li>
            <li> With other tanners my face, hands, and feet are usually blotchy and streaked but that does not happen with fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li> I put a little more on the next day for a little darker tan.</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous about the first application..</li>
            <li> she exfoliates and has tried several times to see barely any difference!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a natural looking fake tan, who doesn&#x27;t wanna risk their safety with a tanning bed, who wants a long lasting tan, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t wanna fork out the cash for a salon spray tan that doesn&#x27;t have the quality that thisproduct does.</li>
            <li> and hours after, it dried very fast and did not streak me or come off on my clothes or in the shower</li>
            <li> It smells good at first, but you have to leave it on for several hours, and as time goes on, it smells worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and red hair, so I don&#x27;t tan very well in the sun and the tanning bed gets expensive and is not healthy.  </li>
            <li> Fast, I mean like in 15 seconds fast.</li>
            <li> I mean, for standard shipping (FREE) I couldn&#x27;t believe how well packaged and</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m seriously orange!&amp;#34; It also didn&#x27;t last very well and came off very splotchy!</li>
            <li> and I pay special attention to negative reviews.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait and see if you did it right a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with how you apply it, but oddly enough it works great.</li>
            <li> but the first application didn&#x27;t leave me very dark.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite for a few reasons, partially due to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very dark anymore, and I can barely see tan lines.. especially on my legs and back, and face.</li>
            <li> Also toned down the areas that absorbed dry patch areas by using the moisturizer, it made things even.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a little messy, make sure and do it somewhere that you can clean up later</li>
            <li> I burn and turn right back to pale never tan.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because it did produce a great color</li>
            <li> It worked very well, but it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my legs (probably because of the time</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the color is that dark, to get the color I really want I have to do two applications.</li>
            <li> It goes on dark, so you can really see what and where your applying it.</li>
            <li> It can really help you achieve a dark color by using some days in a row to build up.</li>
            <li> This does dry quickly, has a decent and subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t streak.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t really provide a dark tan, there is no streaking of the skin....  </li>
            <li> I am very pail and have tried two other brands of self tanners that left me looking streaky and orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Other self tanners that had much longer lasting color and that have also given me my desirable color after one use, but those tend to be the orangey ones.</li>
            <li> I applied this immediately after I exfoliated/shaved/showered/dried off and the next morning I barely saw any brown in the water during my shower.</li>
            <li> and i only had a hint like a barely there hint of color</li>
            <li> The color guard is fool proof and completely wearable if you are wanting to wear it during the day (as long as you won&#x27;t be sweating).</li>
            <li> I left this on for 16 hours and you can barely tell I used anything.  </li>
            <li> few notes for those trying this for the first time from my trial and error:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The first few applications seemed to work well since it provided a bit of color to my legs.</li>
            <li> At first it will smell like coconut but be prepared for the harsh self tanner smell to follow.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pretty pail like me you might have to use it a few days in a row.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but after several uses, I love the product.  </li>
            <li> evens it out pretty well after a few hours.</li>
            <li> so I looked funny for a few days with a ring around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Fake Bake because it is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> Few things first before using I had to cut the straw in the bottle</li>
            <li> The mitt disintegrates more with each use and is not ideal for face applications, as it does not distribute evenly onto face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and really wanted to love this!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks just tan enough, not super dark and definitely not orange.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was super shocked at how easy this stuff was to put on.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s tinted, it was easy to apply evenly, and it dried quickly - no staining clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li> The formula dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to waste time waiting for it dry.</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from tanning applicators or crazy &amp;#34;mitts&amp;#34; but I gave this a try because of the reviews and what a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> but I got splashed by people jumping in the pool and it made very noticable lines down my legs.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than other products!</li>
            <li> So much that I&#x27;ve purchased for other items of this brand!</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for pale whiteys like me.</li>
            <li> Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.  </li>
            <li> I live in New England (which, if you&#x27;re not familiar with Snowpocalipse 2015, has technically turned into Alaska).</li>
            <li> But this is seriously foolproof and will give even the fairest skin tones a chance to feel like a golden goddess!  </li>
            <li> So much better than the other products I used in the past!</li>
            <li> First of all I think a review only works if you know a little background history of the person that used it.</li>
            <li> NATURAL looking (keep in mind this is on practically glow in the dark white girl skin...!) and doesn&#x27;t fade unevenly like most other spray/lotions.</li>
            <li> At first especially on your face after application you will be a little worried that it will streak or not look even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m scrubbing hard either, just a quick sponge off.</li>
            <li> But I am pretty pale</li>
            <li> I am pretty pale in the winter months, so I needed something to make my skin look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and had no issues with this.</li>
            <li> I am pretty pale</li>
            <li> Funny too, cause the rest of your body will still be pale.</li>
            <li> and I have a pretty pale complexion.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought a similar product near the same price, but am much happier with this one!</li>
            <li> That I love it, not sure about winter, it will look quite dark over such non tanned skin and will be way too obvious</li>
            <li> I usually have this funky odor from the other self tanners, but this one is not as strong though,</li>
            <li> It looks natural and lasts a long time on the body and in the bottle!</li>
            <li> The parts that rec&#x27;d the initial fresh, wet mitt turned out noticeably darker than other areas.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was surprised at how natural this tan looks, and i&#x27;m a pale blonde.</li>
            <li> I have used tanning beds for years to get a little color on my very very pale skin, but I have always been worried in the back of my head about what kind of long term damage I was doing.  </li>
            <li> It dries immediately and you could hop right into bed or go about your day - a small amount will rub off on your clothes but it won&#x27;t cause the tan to be streaky.</li>
            <li> and I will usually apply this after I have taken a shower and right before bed</li>
            <li> would highly recommend looking up videos on youtube on how to apply this if you&#x27;re unsure because that&#x27;s what I did and never had any problems with it appearing streaky, orange or any of the other issues people tend to run into with self</li>
            <li> Self-tanners usually dry my skin but also help clear my face, this one gave me some clogged pores/breakouts - I don&#x27;t recommend on the face.  </li>
            <li> I heard great things about this self tanner but was left disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application takes less than 5 minutes and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Also let it dry completely before doing anything.</li>
            <li> Dry off completely.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions written in one review and this product worked perferctly; exfoliate, dry off completely, add moisturizer to knees, elbows, and ankles, apply at night and shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive and dry skin, and atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast, so you can get dressed in minutes instead of standing around like a starfish for half an hour.</li>
            <li> That along with the blending balm on my knuckles and side of my palms is really affective for getting the color to my hands without leaving odd markings or shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That along with the blending balm on my knuckles and side of my palms is really affective for getting the color to my hands without leaving odd markings or shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To use it I have to shave the day before I plan to use it (if I shave the same night my legs don&#x27;t get as dark) and then the night of I exfoliate my whole body, put on in-the-shower lotion and spray my knees and elbows with body oil.</li>
            <li> the glove kind of sucks which was disappointing because the reviews i watched said it was the best part of this particular kit but just during the first application the glove got all nasty and like, matted?</li>
            <li> This gave me a natural looking, long lasting tan.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the professional spray....</li>
            <li> :  Be careful if you wear the product out without rinsing it off first because if it gets wet, it will run.  </li>
            <li> One bottle was enough for at least six full body applications.</li>
            <li> I have medium colored skin, light brown hair, and dark green eyes.</li>
            <li> I tan easily, but I&#x27;m tired of ruining my skin with the sun and tanning beds.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I kept going over and over the same areas on my legs and wasted a lot of the product, and ended up turning bronze orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it a few times following directions exactly and each time my skin looked splotchy</li>
            <li> I found this one late one night and the girl was super tan.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about trying any tanning products but after reading and hearing rave reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate first, use lotion on drier areas such as knees and elbows, spray the mitt a few times, and spread as evenly as you can.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses of the mitt, it was gross and smelled funny.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the smell is fantastic, and even in the morning before I wash it off, the self-tanner smell IS there, but it&#x27;s much more subtle than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, including the Fake Bake foam and lotion formulas.</li>
            <li> I wake up bronzed and after I shower, the base color is gone and I am left with a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly strong and I get tired of the smell.  </li>
            <li> The product said it could be used on your face, although they sell a face lotion version, and while it did work it took a bit of practice to get right of amount (a little goes a long way on the face) of tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Normally with other products I have a hard time wearing spaghetti straps or bras that fit a little tighter than normal because the pressure will take the tan off</li>
            <li> this gives you the option of a deep dark tan if u want or a little light color which is what I needed.  </li>
            <li> you want to get real dark you need to apply a few days in a row, but for someone like me who is real pale one or two applications puts me in a happy place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful around your knees, ankles and elbows, this stuff gives a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply before bed, but I would advise against that if you sweat at night, I ended up sweating in my sleep and had my arm folded and had a very noticeable brown line down my arm the next day.  </li>
            <li> Other than the shade, the main reason this tanner works so well is the mitt - definitely use the mitt!</li>
            <li> I also feel like my color is a little streaky in certain areas,</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, if you&#x27;re pale like me, may not be enough.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying, I&#x27;m pretty pale, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with little mess.</li>
            <li> , basically, I&#x27;ve had great luck with Fake Bake products in the past, and I don&#x27;t think think one is any different.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my second bottle a few weeks back for when I ran out of my first.</li>
            <li> when I take a shower the next day I put another coat on and that&#x27;s it for about four days when it starts to fade, I usually do another coat for a few more day</li>
            <li> When I showered and dried off it was gone and left a pretty tan (obviously it was just the color indicator that streaked).</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t quite last the full week.</li>
            <li> What I am most afraid of when trying new self tanners is that the color will come off orangey and streaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast too, took less than 15min to apply all over, and I seen the results instantly.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is easy to apply, lasts a number of days and looks natural enuf for people to comment on my tan.</li>
            <li> This will soften the dry areas and dilute the tanner enough that it will develop a natural</li>
            <li> I tried St. Tropez mousse previous to this and didn&#x27;t care much for the results (it only worked on my arms).</li>
            <li> I used to tan in a tanning bed daily, even though skin cancer runs through my family and it is terribly unhealthy; however, I refused to get a spray tan out of fear that it would turn me orange, look blochy, rub off easily in skin creases &amp; folds, etc.</li>
            <li> Wear offs easily about after 3 days it also stains light colored clothes which can be annoying</li>
            <li> Then I dry off with a towel, and apply Fake Bake with the handy dandy included mitten.</li>
            <li> I typically go to the tanning bed but it has been a bit pricey lately and the self tanners are also a better alternative for your skin.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it goes away so quick (at least for me)</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo easy to use and gives me an instant dark tan with the bronzer, and develops to a very natural colored dark tan over a few hours, so that by the time you shower and rinse off the bronzer, you are tan underneath.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake has a VERY light coconut smell</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color is VERY light, and washes off immediately in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Despite my Italian heritage, I get pretty pale during the winter months, so every spring I start experimenting with various types of sunless</li>
            <li> The color developed into a very natural bronze shade and dried faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The tan does not last as long as it did with the regular Fake Bake lotion I used before, and when it wears away, it gets kind of blotchy looking.  </li>
            <li> The most annoying thing about this product is that it literally sweats off (I had brown sweat running down my legs), and the color doesn&#x27;t last much more than a day.  </li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliate prior to use and give yourself about 30 mins to dry completely.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is hard to mess up if you take your time &amp; follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to absolutely exfoliate before applying fake bake or it will get patchy like typical tanners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts, but I really like it, and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I exfoliated in the shower the first time, dried off completely, and really worked the spray in well.</li>
            <li> definitely wouldn&#x60;t use it first time before some important event - to be shocked or be surprised on the results ( good or bad way).&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> When I shower for the few days after I use the product I don&#x27;t use a rag and scrub because then it will come off in certain areas.</li>
            <li> My skin started to get very dry and sensitive after I stopped tanning</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after another reviewer said it didn&#x27;t work on her pale skin, but it was fine for me.  </li>
            <li> and the mitt is really beginning to pill and leave little chunks of the material on my skin.</li>
            <li> Mitt could use a little improvement as it doesn&#x27;t stay on your hand very well</li>
            <li> i really think i was glowing in the dark!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does give you a realistic, dark tan that gets you constant compliments.</li>
            <li> I am already quite tan and turn very very tan in the summer, so i got this for the winter times when im not as tan as usual.</li>
            <li> Usually I am either super pale or pretty pink with no in between.</li>
            <li> The only problems I really had was it came off the tops of my feet a little bit and</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s useful for reaching the areas that are hard to reach by hand alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s useful for reaching the areas that are hard to reach by hand alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought Id try this one, it was a little more expensive (not by much)</li>
            <li> on the mitt provided in the box (whichever hand you prefer) then spray the mist directly onto your SKIN, then rub it in gently with the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to rub it too hard because it may irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it has a very dark color gaurd which I appreciated when applying.  </li>
            <li> It also smells a lot better and is less messy than other tanning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Good color, no streaks, the smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for building up a tan over a few days; You&#x27;re not going to apply it once and look like a crazy orange person.</li>
            <li> HUGE problem I have with this is that it is left behind EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> As a very fair-skinned 28-year old female, I&#x27;ve tried self-tanning to avoid the negative effects that sun exposure brings.  </li>
            <li> It was a reasonable price and the results are natural and leaves you looking like you&#x27;ve spent a few days at the beach.</li>
            <li> I have a slightly brown complexion and it makes my tan a little bit yellow, nothing unattractive, but not the true brown</li>
            <li> Well at first I was skeptical because the fragrance was a little strong at</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend Fake Bake and this seller whom i purchased from shipped extremley quick</li>
            <li> The only negative thing that I can say about Tanwise is a few of the tanners I have tried are darker than Tanwise after first application, but for the price and how easy it is to use, just apply it a few days in row to build it up.</li>
            <li> I was a very porcelain pale, so I originally only did one leg to see the differences-</li>
            <li> I personally put the hand pad on a dry clean toilet brush to get the hard parts to reach on my back.  </li>
            <li> my pale skin thanks you!!ross from any gel, cream, liquid or wipe</li>
            <li> on pale skin it turns orangey especially in natural lighting</li>
            <li> Pale skin doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried first because the tanner really stuck to any pieces of dry skin still stuck on my body, so my legs looked weirdly blotchy where I wasn&#x27;t able to get the dry skin off completely (and believe me, I really tried - again, i have crazy dry skin).  </li>
            <li> I followed many of the steps suggested by other reviewers such as cutting the straw, exfoliating before, etc even with this I found streaking and mind you I am very meticulous.</li>
            <li> have sensitive dry skin, and gave up on using tanning beds long time ago because of the drying effect, what I couldn&#x60;t</li>
            <li> My bottle is pretty much half empty.</li>
            <li> Definitely go easy around the usual trouble spots (elbows, knees, etc) though, and exfoliate beforehand to prevent any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate and shave or wax your skin prior to applying the fake bake (very important for an even and long lasting tan).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I do put lotion on my more difficult dry area before applying fake bake, which tends to make it last for a short amount of time causing me to apply about 2ce a week to 1ce a week depending on how I feel,  but one bottle will last you for a good little while.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty devastated to get so pale, but this did the trick!</li>
            <li> The color was very natural looking - just dark enough.  </li>
            <li> It takes all day to dry, it does streak if you are not extremely careful.  </li>
            <li> I only do my feet every other time I use this since I can get them to naturally tan faster than my legs.</li>
            <li> He has tried other products and they always left him orange and any age or darker spots, (he is 57 yrs old)</li>
            <li> I have to reapply daily or every other day so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brown tan as opposed to the orange you get from other fake tanners.  </li>
            <li> The most natural fake tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> The tan looks so natural that no one will be able to tell it&#x27;s fake bake!</li>
            <li> Leaves splotches and where u shave looks HORRIBLE with stained hair folical, tan fast, nice color, and works decent.</li>
            <li> The first major complaint is \\&quot;bottle leakage\\&quot; - the spray bottle that comes with the product is too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> little bit washes off in the shower the first rinse after applying, but what stays behind is a golden tan that I could not be happier</li>
            <li> she was sorry about the inconvenience and quickly sent a new box.</li>
            <li> My white toilet seat has red cheek marks because I sat on it the DAY AFTER using this tanner.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a very pale person.</li>
            <li> did follow all instructions on the bottle, as well as those provided in that first large, helpful review here on Amazon for Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that results in breakouts with any slight change to my facial routine, so I&#x27;m scared to put it on.</li>
            <li> It looks natural not orange like all the other self tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the tone change is not unbelievable in being too dark nor does this turn your organge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, mileage may varies due to natural complexion.</li>
            <li> I am naturally tan due to my heritage so this liquid tan enhances my skin to a bronze toasty look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no trouble with streaking, like I&#x27;ve gotten with other products.</li>
            <li> Natural looking, long-lasting tan compared to the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is also pretty long lasting usually lasts about a week</li>
            <li> But if you are through and work small sections of your body ( such as foot and ankle vs whole left leg) before moving on you can avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> On one leg I sprayed the product directly onto my skin and smoothed it over with the mitt, the other leg I sprayed to the mitt then applied to my skin.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is quick and easy--and looks natural!</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received this product because I was in desperate need of a tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and will more than likely try out their other product as well!</li>
            <li> Been trying to take care of my skin (less Tanning bed) and i live in Florida…</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I feel that at the end of my bottle, the scent was a little more condensed, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it still wasn&#x27;t awful.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I expected a product without that weird sunless tan odor that was easy to apply and resulted in a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> toes - Repeat daily till desired color is achieved  Soooooo much faster, easier, forget the mitt, too much trouble!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s key, to leave it on for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would,  washes off the next day in the shower........</li>
            <li> Gets on white clothes and does not last vary long.</li>
            <li> Stained clothes, sheets, and even the white toilet seat.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that this doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> If you treat your mitt well it last long enough.</li>
            <li> And when I am out hiking or working outside, Obviously I&#x27;m not near naked doing so.</li>
            <li> thought the Guerlain product gave me a natural healthy look without looking overdone, but they have nothing on Fake Bake at one half the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally fake tanners are a nice orange color, but this stuff comes out deep brown, almost black</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes or sheets, smells decent, and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> (please read some of the older posts on this product, their directions are helpful) as I want and instead of the streaky-ness and uneven coverage of a sray tan done by someone.</li>
            <li> but I missed that beautiful brown glow but hated the idea of damaging my skin any further.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed because it looked like this was going to be a good product, but it does not last.    </li>
            <li> I woke up this morning and knew immediately that I had applied Fake Bake after an entire bottle of pinot grigio because the guide was streaked down the right side of my face and right leg.</li>
            <li> The pad used to apply the lotion is getting a little beat up, though, so I bought a new one at a local store for $2.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pale and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting my self tanner to not be streaky or orange or blotchy, and I found that this self tanner fixed all of those problems.</li>
            <li> , I only did my right arm just to compare the quality of the color, and you can barely tell which one is real color, and which one is fake!</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not very precise and was in a big hurry to be done with the process I ended up with a even and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> It\s very easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave any dirty sports on skin.</li>
            <li> This bottle also lasts a really long time, a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried work well, but run out quickly even though im usually only doing a small part of my body.</li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters and they have very different skin types; one is dark skinned and tans easily, but the other is very pale and only burns.</li>
            <li> this product did NOT make me anywhere near orange, it actually, after a few applications gave my the deep brown tan that I got the last time I was in Jamaica.</li>
            <li> but the reviews were very favorably) and we have both been using it approximately 3-4 times a week since early April and are into the second bottle, but there is about 2/3 left.  </li>
            <li> This is what I do with it: first shower and exfoliate then dry off and air out for a few minutes until your skin is dry</li>
            <li> and then don&#x27;t wash it off for at least a few hours or even a full day!</li>
            <li> The only small downside to this particular product would be reaching your back by yourself.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too hard to apply, but I noticed the mitt started balling up and coming apart after my first use.</li>
            <li> so i definitely suggest either washing your mitt out every few times or buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Another user stated she would rub the Fake Bake on a large area such as her leg, and then use what was leftover from that to wipe on her face as to not risk using too much there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen several reviews saying the color doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go outside with it on in public without loooking very strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the high-end self tanners out there (afraid to try drug store for fear I&#x27;d turn out orange), and for less than 1/2 the cost this is just as good.  </li>
            <li> This will allow your dry skin to soak up some of the lotion before it has a chance to soak up too much self tanner (which would have resulted in an uneven tan).</li>
            <li> I apply the tan all over, take my gloves off and rub what&#x27;s left over on my hands, let it dry a minute, put the gloves back on, and rinse the mitt out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments on my tan, and it makes me less self conscious to show my legs.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is easy to use and it comes with blue gloves, and a mitt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to stand around naked waiting for this to dry since it dries instantly!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake was easy to use, you could see where you put it, it gave an instant suntan</li>
            <li> I have one tiny area that is a little darker where I first pit the mitt down</li>
            <li> spa&#x27;s that charge way more for a single fake tan application.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this is really the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> My main issue is that the spray is messy and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the bad smell that most self-tanners have and it provides a natural, non-streaky color after you shower the next day to wash off the tint.  </li>
            <li> The after color when it&#x27;s washed off was a natural dark color</li>
            <li> So far I am on day 5 and still look tan and dark without any noticeable fading.</li>
            <li> , I  got a very even tan color by applying it in small circular motions after exfoliating like another review said to.</li>
            <li> It was kept under my sink, where it is dark and room temp, but it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t absorb too much product (these areas usually do and</li>
            <li> I have tried so many fake tanners from cheap to expensive for years and years and years from Este Lauder to Jergens.  </li>
            <li> It is the only self-tanner I use after trying several brands (both cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li> The self-tanner fills in your pores, making them a dark brown color, and it looks completely unnatural.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the mitt slips around too much on my hands, but I have tiny hands.</li>
            <li> Mixing with a small amount of lotion didn&#x27;t seem to affect the product much at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that every pale someone purchase a product called Xen Tan Blending Balm.</li>
            <li> Washing the mitten also prevents leftover solution from becoming reactivated and leaving darker splotches in random places during application.</li>
            <li> This product really shows your pores :/  </li>
            <li> this is my go to product because it gives me a natural, dark tan.</li>
            <li> I wanted to touch up, so I pumped onto the mitt and pale brown, highly diluted product came out of the nozzle.</li>
            <li> I nearly glowed in the dark....</li>
            <li> and sometimes I feel that it&#x27;s just a bit too dark and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t last me that long I&#x27;m not sure if its cause I use too much each time or what, but each bottle lasts me about 6 applications give or take.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter on my skin/face before applying to fill in the crevices (elbows/knees/ankles) that usually soak up the tanner and looks like dirt and this does really well.</li>
            <li> Well what a big old mess ..  </li>
            <li> I noticed it had a very tropical/coconut smell to it unlike the usual self tan smell.</li>
            <li> It is way too long and would&#x27;ve caused a mess if I hadn&#x27;t checked out the other reviews on here first, telling me to do so.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long after you shower.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s so long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I would buy this again and again and the tan looks even untill about day 3 or 4 after you stop tanning when it starts to fade</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Cons - it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> And this stuff actually lasts and fades naturally, no chunky peeling or scaling.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions by using long circling strokes, it applies evenly and does not look like it is something that has been applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If left too long in sun, mitt will start to get Styrofoam dust (over 2 days).</li>
            <li> last this long 2.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because N.E. winters are long and relatively sunless.</li>
            <li> One reason why this product does not get 5 stars is because the tanned effect does not last long before you need to reapply (5-6 days) to avoid the blotch.</li>
            <li> It will streak if you&#x27;re not careful but not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> The 6 ounce bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> and you could really tell a difference, the product left the mitt rough and it looked uneven on my skin.</li>
            <li> flat out</li>
            <li> Also, six ounces didn&#x27;t seem like it would last long.</li>
            <li> However, it only lasts as long as you don&#x27;t shower...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last that long though.</li>
            <li> Unless you are double-jointed or have long arms, you will need someone to do you back.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but the tan Didn&#x27;t last long at all for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long lasting and will make u want to cancel you</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> And it last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, it does not last as long as I thought, since it said to apply once a week.</li>
            <li> it doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The color itself does not last long.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 8 sunless tanners and Tanwise beats them all for Color, Ease of application, how long it lasts, and how well it fades, the smell and (this is a big one)</li>
            <li> And a bottle seems to last a long, long time, unlike the lotions, which I chug through in 2 weeks and the sprays which last a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a long time I can tell.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li> I have NO CLUE why they such a long tube.</li>
            <li> No icky harsh smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a tan look this good in my life - real OR fake.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed because it looked like this was going to be a good product, but it does not last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> since many pale reviewers claim that ALL of the color washed away after their shower the next morning, I did a second very thin layer after the first layer dried, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i thought it might be too extreme or leave alot of marks but found that it spread very well over skin and the application mitt is now a mandatory for me regardless of what i end up using down the road.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a fan of the coconut smell, but this is so soft and subtle that it is actually quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not looking for a very dark tan so not positive that reapplying daily really gets any darker.</li>
            <li> I did this in my bathroom and just put an old bath towel down on the floor.</li>
            <li> Smells great when it goes on, but the color guard smells a little bad.</li>
            <li> I spent a little too much time fussing over it.  </li>
            <li> but seriously, stained linoleum and toilet seats aren&#x27;t funny, especially when you&#x27;re renting!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dark when you first apply, but I use it before bed and a lot comes off when I wash my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> , I started looking like the pale self again, just like the other &amp;#34;fake bake products&amp;#34;, I put it on after that amount of days and this would not go on, like only certain parts on the skin.</li>
            <li> The spray gets on nearby surfaces (hello, white bathroom) and it&#x27;s hard to judge how much you should spray onto the mitt.  </li>
            <li> And also the 6 ounce bottle actually last a really long time!</li>
            <li> One potential con is you do need to re-apply more often than with other products (as other reviewers have stated), but since it doesn&#x27;t carry that awful DHA smell other products do, I have no issues with more frequent reapplications!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried with a spray tanner that I would look orange, but it looks really natural!  </li>
            <li> am continuing to use the Fake Bake Flawless spray and mitt to even out the tone of other bronzing lotions, and I like it for difficult areas like ankles, neck, and face.</li>
            <li> Could be a little darker like the lotion and spray but by far the easiest to apply!</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good product however, even following all the instructions prior applying it, it gets a little uneven and fake looking on your legs.</li>
            <li> Color does not last very long though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really go on very dark but gives a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> and it did not last very long.</li>
            <li> However, like others have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t last very long and it has an aroma somewhat like a three dollar hooker might have.</li>
            <li> Cons: DOesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect one that wouldn&#x27;t cause streaking, a bad smell or worse the orange tone.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had a missed spot or a random spot else where that I touched by accident.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake goes on easily</li>
            <li> and I had to be completely dry before applying it for the color to even show up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely say that if you have dry skin to do your exfoliation routine and very shortly after tour skin is dry to apply the 0roduct...</li>
            <li> There is no classic-self-tanner smell, it dries almost instantly, it is so easily to apply, and the color is SO even and does not look fake or orange at all.</li>
            <li> Helpful hints include applying one coat letting it dry and then applying a second coat for a darker color.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problems and my cracks and scale are hidden.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that too much on my face looks a bit ruddy or dirty instead of golden.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that does not cling to my dry areas (knees, elbows, ankles, and hands).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to put alot on as most of it washes away the next morning in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I tried to wash out the mitt, and let it dry before putting on a second coat to even out some spots, but the mitt wasn&#x27;t completely dry, so again, it turned my skin blue.  </li>
            <li> I wait for it to dry, then hop in bed naked.</li>
            <li> I know it says not to put anything on prior, but i did put on baby lotion and let it dry before doing the tanner.</li>
            <li> This stuff applies easily, does not over power me with \\&quot;fake</li>
            <li> spread waiting for it to dry enough</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel sticky afterward, and you don&#x27;t have to wait around naked for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I wash the mitt every 3-4 uses, let dry in the sun, (just put by window not necessarily outside</li>
            <li> I am a light skin Hispanic woman, and now with this Fake Bake I have managed to gain enough color to look like I&#x27;ve been away on a cruise or something.  </li>
            <li> It only takes an hour to completely dry and set.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow.</li>
            <li> a dry white wash cloth;&lt;br /&gt;-I apply make up after using FB -no</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin you have to hydrate a couple hours later-</li>
            <li> but i like to be dark , so i guess it&#x27;s really about how dark you want to be .</li>
            <li> I do have a few splotchy areas here and there, but I&#x27;ve only applied this four times so far.</li>
            <li> My husband helps me with my shoulder blades, center of my back plus my lower-middle back.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen everyday so my natural color is WHITE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs and am careful around knees and ankles or it makes it really obvious.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I did not apply enough, so I applied it for the next 2 nights, but still not much of a change.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on my face, I knew I was going to have to go in hiding for a few days because it was so dark.</li>
            <li> But it seems like it will last a long, long time</li>
            <li> Mitt turned a weird green color after a couple weeks, but I&#x27;m assuming you have to replace it frequently as it gets old quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the color, hate that it rubs off so fast.</li>
            <li> It does give you a nice fake tan after a few days.</li>
            <li> he was first to strip down and demand I spray him down!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it, I&#x27;ve done 2 applications this week to get my base color</li>
            <li> (You know the people i&#x27;m talking about), but just a nice natural base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used them on my legs because every single one I&#x27;ve used has made me orange and put me off from trying them on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, every single time, it seems like the color just washes off after showering the next day.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a single male...</li>
            <li> the only big difference is I have a very natural looking tan leg and a very pale leg.</li>
            <li> Im a pale irish girl and this is BY FAR</li>
            <li> Only stuff that gives my PALE self a natural non-orange color.</li>
            <li> Made my pale Irish skin look naturally tan.</li>
            <li> I expected an odd color at first because of the color guide, but after washing it off the next morning, my skin was still an odd color.</li>
            <li> that said, this was a COMPLETE mess.</li>
            <li> When you spray it from the bottle it will make a mess even if you&#x27;re spraying directly to the mitt.</li>
            <li> You can see where you&#x27;re applying it, it sinks in really quickly and while it does have an obvious smell, it&#x27;s lighter, much less offensive and less self-tan-er-y than all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I took the other reviewers&#x27;advice and trimmed the little tube in the squirt bottle straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I did apply it directly to the mitt and rubbed in small circular motions doing just one part of my body at a time, upper arm/shoulder, lower arm, upper leg, lower leg, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great instant dark color will rinse off but the self tanner base layer will stay about 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very difficult not to get all over -- wherever the mist landed stained my white bathroom counters if left more than a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I apply this 3 times a week, but after reaching a certain level of darkness, I&#x27;m finding it hard to get any darker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Wasnt trying to be as dark as the real sun gets me but a slight tint being</li>
            <li> Exfoliate first and put lotion on dry parts, duh.</li>
            <li> I quickly washed it off and sprayed a small patch on a few friends to ensure it wasn&#x27;t just me.</li>
            <li> I live in the upper Midwest, so being as white as a fish&#x27;s belly is common, but I still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I am a skin cancer survivor who is serious about my sunless tanning and this is one of the most natural looking glows out there with a very subtle and unobtrusive scent.  </li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated user of St. Tropez mousse self tanner since I was able to buy it through a retailer - but it becomes a bit expensive once compared to other self tanners, so I decided to give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally you&#x27;ll find a red one, which is medium coarseness, and if you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it is.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is it virtually has no smell like many other fake tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> The only reason i only give 4 starts is because i have to apply it like every other day</li>
            <li> If YOU are already familiar with FAKE TANNING LOTIONS and products then you definitely have to GET THIS!!</li>
            <li> and its obvious to other people when your skin is constantly a different shade.</li>
            <li> I would be careful while applying around the ankles and the back of the foot because I applied it to my foot and decided to go back over my ankles and the back and sides of my foot about a hour later because it looked like it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my legs</li>
            <li> After using other fake bake products I thought I would love a deeper color.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed back in November with Stage 0 Melanoma due to extensive use of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple self-tanners over the years and have never used one regularly because they smell, wear off too quickly, streak and look fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS and one of the main problems I usually have is that they either make me have an orange tint</li>
            <li> I seriously treat it like nuclear waste, it has its own little spot because otherwise it will leak/stain everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say that I would recommened the darker one just because I am pretty pale and the darker one is just less time consuming for me.</li>
            <li> With your right hand hold at the corner and reach over your back then with your left hand reach under your back and grab the other corner then drag it back and forth behind you to wipe the color in.</li>
            <li> The natural solution I came up with was cutting down the straw to make it short enough to fit in the bottle and prevent leaks.</li>
            <li> Also, I saw that some reviews complained of the mitt being too large for their hands.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other tanners I have used and it will blotch or streak of you</li>
            <li> Once you get a little practice, you can give yourself a tan that looks natural and has no streaks.</li>
            <li> After showering/exfoliating, but before drying off, I spray a little Avon skin so soft oil on my skin and rub it in like you would with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t concern me though as I just want a little bit of color so it still appears natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have streaks or dark patches like other products, this actually makes me look naturally</li>
            <li> Not only does this color look very comparable, but it&#x27;s much easier to control and less likely to get random brown spots on hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I am allergic to the main ingredient in all of these self tanners.</li>
            <li> least favorite thing is that whenever I use it there&#x27;s very noticeable pore marks which never happened with my other fake tanners.</li>
            <li> my first application, I missed a few places on my legs, so it did look a little splotchy.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little too dark if I apply too much.  </li>
            <li> I also find it&#x27;s hard to get a really even coverage with the glove.</li>
            <li> Enough to look a little tan and not pasty white but not enough that people think....&amp;#34;hmmm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very dark but natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t get very dark the first go round.</li>
            <li> , Is that my tan fades within a few days....and the pores on my face and chest are very dark the first day or so after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not so dramatic that people notice right away or that it is obvious I self tanned.</li>
            <li> and I honestly could not find one bad review</li>
            <li> Nice smell while applying, and doesn&#x27;t smell TOO bad after the 8 hours after it&#x27;s done processing</li>
            <li> sorta went bad after the first couple uses, the soft surface isn&#x27;t soft anymore, that&#x27;s my only complaint really</li>
            <li> Free mit is LAME...</li>
            <li> After the application, your face and body will look &#x27;dirty&#x27; and maybe even blotchy; which is totally ok.  </li>
            <li> The product did not give a dark or med tan even and if so it wasted soo much product.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the smell of the types of sprays and lotions but this one smells great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought everything from cheap lotion to expensive gels and even used aerosol spray tanners and gotten Mystic Tans.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake goes on streak free, it has color guard so you can tell where you already applied it.</li>
            <li> also got the 60 minute fake bake and used it yesterday and it looks fabulous~</li>
            <li> She also told me that she picked it up at a professioanal trade show and that it was not available to the general public!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells better than any fake tanner I&#x27;ve used, but the color isnt that dark after one application.</li>
            <li> This mixture can be applied daily to maintain the initial dark tan you apply.</li>
            <li> I recommend to wash the mit before initial use as it left a dark fuzz all over me.</li>
            <li> The old ones that left you looking like an orange alien?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanners throughout my middle school/high school/collegiate struggle to be tan (or at least a normal, non-ghost shade).</li>
            <li> It may still look dark, but once you shower the next day or 6hrs later, it comes off</li>
            <li> want to let you know to be careful and try it out before a big event.</li>
            <li> As others suggested, DO apply in empty tub or shower and aim low as the over spray gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> streak (as long as you rub in well) or look orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have told a few people that my tan was \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and they are always surprised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just be careful doing your hands- keep your fingers bent, so that you don&#x27;t get lines in your knuckles, and same thing with elbows and knees- keep them bent.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to rub your face, especially around the mouth area.</li>
            <li> it was slightly long.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a bit too long, though.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had know about this product a long time ago</li>
            <li> The spray bottle has too long of a \\&quot;straw\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It also partially washes off in the shower the next day.  </li>
            <li> I was in an early fall wedding and had to get rid of the uneven tan</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spraying directly on your skin and rubbing in with the mitt, as I&#x27;ve found spraying it on the mitt wastes a lot of product.</li>
            <li> As long as you exfoliate and don&#x27;t leave it on too long</li>
            <li> plan on going out and possible getting th lease bit wet, OR sweating,</li>
            <li> I expected something very different.</li>
            <li> I have been self-tanning for a long time, and have used just about every product out there.  </li>
            <li> And finally, waiting Atleast 24 hours to wet the areas where the product is applied helps to keep color longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind as long as it got me tan.</li>
            <li> I just wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt to bed.</li>
            <li> Did leave some minor streaks.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I will be using this all summer long.</li>
            <li> and I must say, I look like I just stepped out of a tanning bed or had a long day in the sun without burning.</li>
            <li> i was listening to a song that was 4 min long</li>
            <li> What a strange product.</li>
            <li> It goes a long ways (you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to get desired effect.</li>
            <li> Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes.  </li>
            <li> No orangey strange color.</li>
            <li> I went on a week long cruise and didn&#x27;t take my bottle.</li>
            <li> and I want it to be a mousse, even though I do not spray this directly on my skin, I put it on the mitt, it is still messy.</li>
            <li> Downsides: the tube of the spray bottle was too long (what???</li>
            <li> And one bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Peels off unevenly when it get old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing this as long as they care to make it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the next night after I had applied it I took a bath - scrubbed with a rough wash cloth specifically made to exfoliate and lots of soap..  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my pink undertones skin look orange.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shave until after the product has dried and developed and the color guard is washed off.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no streaks, spots, as long as you rub in evenly.</li>
            <li> I had bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and all I can say is that it is by far (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> no matter how long I sit in front of a fan or dont move.</li>
            <li> Even with trimming the long tube as others suggest, the sprayer does not work correctly-</li>
            <li> The straw is too long for the bottle but cut it about an inch or so at the bottom before you use it</li>
            <li> But this has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it will rub off on fabric; which I think is to be expected with any self tanner.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful especially after you put it on.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful and not wear white, because it does rub off.  </li>
            <li> supply lasts for a REALLY long time.</li>
            <li> Just buy it and don&#x27;t get pissed if you arent careful enough and get it streaky.  </li>
            <li> Or, if you have a one of those back washing brushes, you can try slipping the mitt over it.</li>
            <li> As long as you exfoliate once a week and reapply to get the desired skin tone, you will never have any problems with streaks or splotches.  </li>
            <li> will ALWAYS buy this product as long as the formula remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to self tanner for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe i&#x27;ll update on how this product held up on a long term basis.</li>
            <li> mitt gets rid of any possibility of streaking or splotches as long as you blend, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about washing your hands afterwards</li>
            <li> I will use this self tanner for as long as I want to be tan :</li>
            <li> It does have a strange scent that makes me feel like I haven&#x27;t showered in days, even though I showered hours before.</li>
            <li> I dried off completely and then rubbed it in blending etc slept in it</li>
            <li> Maybe the mitt wasn&#x27;t wet enough</li>
            <li> It is way to long.  </li>
            <li> The straw is too long so cut before putting into the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fyi, I had an old bottle of this that I tried to use this month, and I noticed the liquid was spraying on the mitt green.</li>
            <li> It does not have a long shelf life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have grey sheets</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time for me to get tan.</li>
            <li> It is such a drag when I have already done my legs, and I am up to spraying my arms</li>
            <li> I have been self tanning for a long time ...</li>
            <li> , it comes from the manufacture with the tube being too long for the bottle</li>
            <li> however long the directions say.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; to this tanner is that the blush color comes off when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Once the blush color rinses off, the tan underneath lasts about 5 days as long as I do not exfoliate between applications.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> The color it turned my skin was also not natural looking.</li>
            <li> I use it all summer long and people compliment my tan all the time.</li>
            <li> The product does go a long way, but I do want to keep it on hand.  </li>
            <li> Lets just say it took a long time for it to go away...</li>
            <li> it was too long and you need to exfoliate with a mitt</li>
            <li> I received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so long sleeves cover the horrendous color.</li>
            <li> Look like you spent a week at the beach instantly.</li>
            <li> It lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts so long that I forgot</li>
            <li> doesn&#x60;&#x60;t stay on too long in swimming pools -I wish somebody can offer one for SWIMMERS!&lt;br /&gt;FB does not have any SPF properties -</li>
            <li> lucko long in swimming pools -I wish somebody can offer one for SWIMMERS!&lt;br /&gt;FB does not have any SPF properties -</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally takes 10 mins tops to apply and dries almost instantly, there is absolutely no wait time before you can get dressed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a tanning,bed in a long time</li>
            <li> long sweeping motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The application is quite a long process too using that mitt I tried not using the mitt and the tanner would not wash off my hands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in a long time and</li>
            <li> This review is for all the Asians out there that are curious about this product and how the color comes off on our Asian skin tones.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the color doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I use it all summer long</li>
            <li> After I exited the shower and dried off completely, I added a dab of baby oil gel to my knees to lessen the amount of self-tanner that was deposited there.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t like how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of tanning beds for a long time..</li>
            <li> Mine was way too long for the bottle</li>
            <li> I always just end up with a cabinet full of useless, smelly lotions, mousse and sprays and end up back in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Will never get spray tan again, better yet my 21 year old will save money and keep out of dangerous sin / tanning beds!</li>
            <li> First, some information about my skin tone: I&#x27;m blonde with green eyes and I turn purple when I&#x27;m cold and red when I&#x27;m hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time ever using any sort of tanning (I&#x27;ve never gone to tanning place to get a natural or a fake tan nor have I ever used an at home tanner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did because the first layer didn&#x27;t show that big of a difference, but I read you&#x27;re supposed to apply thin layers.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not clear so you can see where you&#x27;re putting it on.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that if you wait too long after you spray it, it is much harder to spread around evenly.</li>
            <li> it is that I felt like it didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the mitt, but I was really pleasantly surprised at how nicely &amp; smoothly it applies the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good base color, on winter skin looking for a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> and so I have a good base tan</li>
            <li> I bought this product to get a good base time before going to the lake this weekend for Memorial Day, I hope it can withstand me being in and out of the water all weekend.</li>
            <li> I just hate having to spend almost 20$ for 2 weeks, maybe 2 1/2 weeks of good tan.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a 2nd bottle, several months later when I used it, it was terrible, debated ordering again, broke down ordered 3rd bottle (it is great)..</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is putting a towel down while you use it as it will make a mess on the floor that is hard to clean up/much easier to wash a towel.  </li>
            <li> It is only after application that you see that initial tinge going down the shower drain</li>
            <li> but when my package ends aand don&#x27;t really feel like buying a new one ill use this.</li>
            <li> It prevents me from wearing shorts because im so self conscious about how Pale I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale, do not tan naturally, and have a family history of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ll probably be as tan as can look natural on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Although I am not as pale as before I applied the &amp;#34;Fake Bake&amp;#34; I do not have nearly the tan</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am pale as heck.</li>
            <li> I mad sure to apply this evenly, the morning after I washed my face and got some water running down my arm, it left a LONG white streak and didnt go away till after I exfoliated 2-3x.</li>
            <li> I use this (post Fake Bake application) to smooth out those dry areas - (for me) feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t come off on my white towels and even after workouts/showers/shaving, I&#x27;ve only had to do that one slight touch-up.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me about a month and a half, applying regularly as I said above.</li>
            <li> I found that this product really was easier and less messy to apply - just spray on the included mitt and rub in.</li>
            <li> and if you moisturize daily will look very natural for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> and it looks very natural as long as you don&#x27;t go overboard or do it without a mirror.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida but haven&#x27;t been out in the sun for the past 6months (winter) ...  </li>
            <li> I had small issues around my ankles and knees but nothing that stopped me from showing off my new tan.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash the applicator mit in the dishwasher and it comes out new again.</li>
            <li> I am very pale with pink undertones and this product really evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and gave my very pale skin a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> I live in Wisconsin and after not seeing the sunlight for six months and being pale to begin with, I&#x27;m not much darker</li>
            <li> I am very pale and with summer right around the corner I wanted to try something to give me a little color.</li>
            <li> Although it did not smell bad and the color looked good, the application was a mess.</li>
            <li> I looked very orange just like every other self tanner I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat Fake Bake, works much better than spray on mess</li>
            <li> I sleep in white sheets and there was never a problem, although the next night you definitely can smell the self-tanner where you slept (although it&#x27;s much less than other self tanners, like St. Tropez, leave you</li>
            <li> last as long as other sunless tanners without maintenence.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the color does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> so you could do it every other day if you want that long lasting look.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look like a total streaky mess an hour later</li>
            <li> You can find Tanwise products here on Amazon or at a Sally Beauty supply near you - but remember, they are NOT easy to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> You can find Tanwise products here on Amazon or at a Sally Beauty supply near you - but remember, they are NOT easy to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> It actually did not rub off on my sheets after a nighttime application and given ample time to dry (I did a touch test after about 15 minutes and was dry), but did on the waistband of my pants just slightly the next day, not doing anything to the color already on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, looks natural, takes less time to apply than lying in a tanning bed, and is much less expensive and safer.  </li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes to do your whole body ( or at least the parts you can reach) dries almost instantly and does not rub off on clothing or beddings .</li>
            <li> I expected at least a week to appear tanned but really within a few days it was completely faded, even after applying 3 consecutive days.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and no matter how much or how little I exfoliate, this seems to apply and wear a little patchily.</li>
            <li> I think I will stick to the original fake bake lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes you tan, not orange like some other products and has no gross smell to it.</li>
            <li> i also put on a little lotion in those weird areas like the knees, elbows and wrists and ankles, just so it blends better.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> The only other product I use is Sally Hansen, but it has a shimmer to it</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to the other self tanners or the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Loreal, Jergens, Banana Boat, and other various brands at Sally&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE IT IN STOCK!  </li>
            <li> I had a friend recommend the original fake bake lotion</li>
            <li> They use it especially before formal dances and whenever they want to have a little extra color!  </li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> The darker sank into the pores on my legs whereas I didn&#x27;t notice this problem with the original Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I would be open to trying other products by this company based off of the non orangey color</li>
            <li> I would of given 5 stars had it last a little bit longer but for sun in a bottle it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self-tanners and was left with orange streaks.</li>
            <li> Love me some Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> Then I skipped a day, and applied the next two consecutive days, and suddenly I was nicely dark!  </li>
            <li> I love Fake bake!</li>
            <li> I have a small seborrheic keratoses spot on the side of my leg near my knee that completely blends in with my skin and goes unnoticed during the winter months</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers suggested; purchase the exfoliating scrub cloths and use them in the shower prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> It also last longer than other ones I try.</li>
            <li> : this is one of less-good self-tanners for your face, possibly because the mitt applicator doesn&#x27;t rub in as deeply as your hands might, so you can look a little speckled.</li>
            <li> the only possible thing that I could say is that the bottle could use a little updating.</li>
            <li> I would use this if I were going on vacation and wanted to show my legs after living in the frozen north all winter long!</li>
            <li> Will repurchase every summer as long as it&#x27;s around!</li>
            <li> The only issue I had is that I would get a little water on my skin while cleaning up after application and it would leave a white water trail on my skin where the spray came off.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what other reviewers have said this stuff totally DOES have the self tanner smell after a couple hours</li>
            <li> The other issue with the Tanwise is the bronzers WILL stain your hands, and the only way to get it off is with baking soda.</li>
            <li> The other issue with the Tanwise is the bronzers WILL stain your hands, and the only way to get it off is with baking soda.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Fake Bake original formula for years.  </li>
            <li> formula a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Myself and 2 other bridesmaid risked it big time and tried this the night before a wedding</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> LASTS LONG!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the guide color can be a little deceiving about how tan you are actually getting.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to find this product !  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to get the tanning stuff that is actually for you face, because with this stuff it made me break out a little bit; although I have not bought the stuff that is actually for my face.</li>
            <li> Self tanners are the only other choice if you want some color.  </li>
            <li> The color is very different from every other tanner I&#x27;ve used, no orangy look at all.  </li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> It does fade a little bit but not anything too major.</li>
            <li> One spray goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am going to try a rubber band the next time I use it, but I predict it won&#x27;t work that well because the mitt is a little short...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely smells like any other tanner.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried leave you guessing until the next day.  </li>
            <li> If you love being fake than this is for you!</li>
            <li> I love everything about Fake Bake !</li>
            <li> Definitely heed the warning not to get wet at all during the set time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other self tanning products (Jergens, L&#x27;oreal sublime glow...)</li>
            <li> I have seen other product mitts, however, and they are all made the same way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love the Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> It took them over a month after my constant tries to contact them for me to even get a reply!</li>
            <li> my white sheets were ORANGEY PINK!</li>
            <li> My favorite fake tanner!</li>
            <li> LOVE Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends who are wasting their time building a harmful tan only to hit their mediocre peak color in hot, stinky, occasionally not thoroughly cleaned, tanning beds.</li>
            <li> So hopefully it works for other people obviously it has, but for me I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> I buy it two bottles at a time, even though one lasts me a long time, just because I NEVER want to be without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a decent color, but is hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> and I still have more after a year of casual use.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li> The only con is it takes for ever to set and dry other</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it takes quite a few applications to get a decent sun kissed looked and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d hope.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light with a very faint hint of coconut.</li>
            <li> and it lasts me a very long time</li>
            <li> But be very careful if you wear white after applying.</li>
            <li> , my problem with it is that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to stay very long.</li>
            <li> I then washed my mitt to make it last a little longer, but I do think I will end up having to buy another because I can&#x27;t see it lasting for a real long time.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Just be warned, product can still stain well after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a moisturizer, and i apply after getting out of the shower, made my skin dry since i couldn&#x27;t apply moisturizer after getting out of the shower like normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t come off on clothes once you are dry.</li>
            <li> Dry off and air dry a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> I followed another reviewers advice and exfoliated, put some lotion on, let it dry, then apply the product.</li>
            <li> I then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I hop of the shower, put lotion all over, wait for that to dry, then apply this all over with the mitt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes/Tips:&lt;br /&gt;You must cut the plastic tube to fit properly in the bottle, measure before cutting.</li>
            <li> I shower and use a scrub and pat dry with the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always exfoliate in the shower, then put this stuff on, let myself dry for about 30 minutes, and then put lotion over it to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I then pat dry with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is blothy after a day or two without reapplying and is lighter in dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I seriously looked really tan.  </li>
            <li> If you have any dry skin on knees &amp; elbows</li>
            <li> I wash my hand mitt with soap and water and let air dry in the shade.</li>
            <li> Like all fake tanners, it will fade after a few showers, but it&#x27;s easy enough to apply that it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Within 4 min it was dry.</li>
            <li> and it was dry by the end.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate and use blending balm or lotion wherever your skin is really dry.</li>
            <li> I let it dry then apply another layer, but that still just smudges it.</li>
            <li> Ran, made me look dry &amp; orange.</li>
            <li> It is dry within seconds of applying.</li>
            <li> Watch out for dry skin spots.</li>
            <li> that way they are not as dry.</li>
            <li> Just resign yourself to reapplying often (but remember the prep - exfoliating and moisturizing dry areas before).  </li>
            <li> So If I had dry skin, I would not apply it on my face.</li>
            <li> When i rubbed my skin it felt dry</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and tan.</li>
            <li> I would shower before bed, apply and let it dry</li>
            <li> Once your skin is dry then apply the product and let it set overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake a few times this summer already and really love the product.</li>
            <li> Any dry patches of skin (ex: knees, elbows, feet, etc.) will tend to absorb excess product and effect the smoothness of the tan.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for about 5 minutes, but probably don&#x27;t even need to.</li>
            <li> I rinse the mitt after each application and drop it over the spray bottle to dry.  </li>
            <li> It is dry with in minutes and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> my skin came into contact with after it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it sticks to dry or damaged skin, including the hair follicles where I shaved before applying -</li>
            <li> Stand on a DRY floor or towel as tanner may mix with water on the floor and stain your soles.</li>
            <li> put this stuff on waited 5 minutes to dry and threw on pj&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It goes on dry, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> OR as per update 7/25/2014 you can also use a dry brush pre-shower instead of a bath mitt and Vaseline/Smith&#x27;s rosebud salve/Badger balm instead of blending balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wait a minute for it to dry before dressing for bed.  </li>
            <li> Just put the mitt upright to dry.  </li>
            <li> I had to retunr because it was smelly and doesn&#x27;t dry well.</li>
            <li> Also let your body COMPLETELY DRY hair and all before you apply.</li>
            <li> If you wait until you&#x27;re dry though everything will be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do recommend exfoliating b/c dry skin will cause discoloration.</li>
            <li> One piece of advice though is to place a towel a underneath you when doing this and always wash the mitt after using and let air dry.</li>
            <li> Fully dry in like 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I showered, exfoliated with shower gloves, and then applied to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> &gt; - Goes on with a dry feel and does not rub off&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put it on in the morning, let it dry before you put on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Just a shower, continuous spray, and dry.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tried to purchase the Xen Tan Blending Balm everyone was talking about.  </li>
            <li> (so plenty of time for it to sink in and dry).</li>
            <li> I followed everyones suggestions of exfoliating and applying lotion to dry areas before application.</li>
            <li> so you are really dry.  </li>
            <li> I used this in the morning, let dry and then went about my day.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin &amp;chemistry is different so what might work &amp;look great on 1person, might look horrible on another.</li>
            <li> I have dry eczema patches on my elbows and my lower legs</li>
            <li> Get the dry oil and exfoliater, too.</li>
            <li> Just try to pat dry instead of rubbing with your towel.</li>
            <li> It you allow the tanner to dry for 5 minutes it will not smear on your fabrics.</li>
            <li> A lot of people mention exfoliating and putting lotion on dry spots, but even when I skip those steps</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t apply this to dry skin, but wait maybe 10min after you are moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wait 10 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> but I was not exceptionally in to the whole idea of lines or splotches.</li>
            <li> THEY ALSO SAY TO USE THE OIL TO ELP FOR AREA THAT ARE DRY OR UNEVEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I dry skin brush my skin</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , let it dry for a couple hours then go to sleep</li>
            <li> I have let this dry for 5-10 minutes, then have put my pajamas on...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any smell a few hours later at all actually.</li>
            <li> lasting only a few days.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been trying different self-tanners for the last few months.</li>
            <li> Still have quite a bit despite using it a few times this summer, but will definitely buy again when next summer rolls around.</li>
            <li> If it is messy this next time, I WILL send it back.</li>
            <li> I usually only use this every few months when I care about how white I am.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few reviews on here that have complaints about this product that I&#x27;m going to address here (mostly noting why they&#x27;re silly complaints).</li>
            <li> whole thing of spraying a fake tanner on a pad and rubbing it on your skin seemed so far fetched to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After exfoliating in the shower really well (use a shower gel that has beads or granules in it to help remove dead skin) and shaving, I got out of the shower and dried off.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they missed to pack 2 the first time round.</li>
            <li> well it only lasts like a day, you have to reapply it everyday if you want a lasting tan.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and got a nice base tan instantly.</li>
            <li> down side was it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The price is great and I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have naturally pale skin (Irish/German heritage with blonde hair and blue eyes -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; shade of pale with a pink undertone, and this product produces a natural looking color on me.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde haired, blue eyed, pale skinned college student looking for something that doesn&#x27;t make me look orange while staying on a budget.</li>
            <li> I am pale white Irish chick.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the tan is not very long lasting and becomes patchy looking after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s dark for the first night</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews on here should be disregarded if you really know how to exfoliate well and apply the right way</li>
            <li> the #of reviews and how every single one of them raved about it I was sold..</li>
            <li> I have tried every single one out there..</li>
            <li> I have tried every single thing out there.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to look a bit orange, but not even a single hint of orange appeared.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY single self tanner that you can purchase in a drugstore and have NEVER found one I like, so that is why I continued to use the tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I tried EVERY single self-tanner out there.</li>
            <li> pasty white but more sickly and transparent in the winter</li>
            <li> Got a weird tan on my back right before needing to wear an off the shoulder dress, tried this in hopes of blending my tan lines.</li>
            <li> This helps the product to soak into the skin and for me it last about a week and is just the right color without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d switch, but Fake Bake beat out St. Tropez for me right now!</li>
            <li> color is very natural looking on my very pale skin.</li>
            <li> as several have said before me, I recommend cutting the tube to the sprayer about an inch or a little more</li>
            <li> so far she has used very little</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 3-5 minutes to dry completely, I then apply another coat for a darker &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It helps to apply a thin layer of the lotion/barrier cream first if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pale skinned, and yet have dark brown hair, so a tan really does a lot for me.</li>
            <li> While applying, the fragrance is nice but after about an hour it wears off and smells bad on the skin just like all other self-tanners, even after showering.</li>
            <li> The bronze in the color guide is what makes you look dark initially, and then some gets washed off in the shower, making it slighly lighter looking.</li>
            <li> so may go with the dark version next time?  </li>
            <li> The color guard is not overwhelming, looks natural.</li>
            <li> It bronzes as you tan, but the tan you get will not be quite as dark as the bronze, which rinses off the next morning.</li>
            <li> Do I get a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only used it once 2 days ago, I&#x27;m not sure how long the tan will last.</li>
            <li> But one application is dark enough.</li>
            <li> Back to Xen-Tan Dark Lotion for me.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it goes on dark, so you can actually see where it has been applied</li>
            <li> Obviously you can keep applying layers until you&#x27;re as dark as you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because if you shave and them immediately apply the product, it will seep into your pores leaving you tiny dark specs.</li>
            <li> not sure how long a bottle would last using it daily, but I will update this to let you all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dark enough at night, it will be in the morning.</li>
            <li> I spray it directly on myself (in small areas at a time) and then rub it in ..</li>
            <li> I just received my box in the mail and it was completely soaked through with product, I am returning it and am not sure if I will rebuy.</li>
            <li> I Actually Looked Too Dark</li>
            <li> I read the directions, but they didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; completely into my head because I was so anxious to try it</li>
            <li> Nothing dark (I guess you could re-apply the next night to go darker)</li>
            <li> I spray tanner directly onto my body working small areas at a time.  </li>
            <li> someone brought all the ladies there a bag full of Fake Bake products.</li>
            <li> and I spent my late teens and early 20&#x27;s managing a tanning salon and tanning daily.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> And if you have any sort of age spots/scars/freckles, it will MAGNIFY them (but that is true of any fake tanner I believe).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I expected it to either.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it to work everyone was asking me if I had been in the tanning bed, although I didn&#x27;t want to share my secret</li>
            <li> After it sits for a while, it gets a touch of the fake tan smell, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some of the others that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember, some color will wash down the drain when you next shower, but if you&#x27;re not as dark as you&#x27;d like, reapply the next night.  </li>
            <li> I wear loose clothing afterwards, I do notice some rub off but it washes out.</li>
            <li> and I am wearing a loose dress.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, looks natural, the only con is that it&#x27;s a little bit expensive......</li>
            <li> I have to do this every day, but if you wash your face less, you can probably get away with less frequent applications.</li>
            <li> Once that color was all rinsed down the drain and left as a yucky brown ring around my tub, all of the color was gone.</li>
            <li> i used in the summer and got water on my legs and had white areas where water dripped down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any residue in my bed or on my towels, however I did notice when showering the next morning some of it washing off down the drain.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it does get on clothes or blankets if you sleep in it.</li>
            <li> Also, this is not meant to be used upside down to spray, if you do that it will come out &amp;#34;spitting&amp;#34;, which you will instantly have to rub in or you will get splotches.</li>
            <li> If you apply this in the shower then rinsing it down (cleaning up) is not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Laid down on my white sheets , It did not rub off on my sheets</li>
            <li> Be it the palms of my hands, a streak down the back of my leg..</li>
            <li> It works almost instantly unlike other lotions that take two weeks to build up!</li>
            <li> so I can look sun-kissed all year long!!</li>
            <li> I am VERY pale and live in the east coast so tanning is not much of an option come summer time</li>
            <li> The color is very natural for my skin tone, dries quick, not sticky, no streaks, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of the product so this bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> The second major complaint is about the application mitt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little unclear what side of the mitt you&#x27;re supposed to use for what, but I just use the dark (soft) side for everything.</li>
            <li> At first i was looking for a lotion because sprays sounded so messy and hard to apply, [but not this stuff</li>
            <li> Tropez, St.Moriz, as well as almost all drug store brands and a few other more expensive brands and none of them 1.</li>
            <li> I just hand wash mine in the sink with soap or laundry detergent and then let it dry!</li>
            <li> Or tan will darken the dry spots 3 times!</li>
            <li> Product works as described, unless you have dry legs!</li>
            <li> Then dry off &amp; apply this!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look artificial and is relatively easy to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once already and only noticed a slight tan.</li>
            <li> i tried that (by hand, of course) and yet it still shed the second time  - although much less this time (thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have been using Clarins Self Tanning Gel which had been my gold standard.  </li>
            <li> After using several days in a row I did find there to be a slight tanner smell but not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> If not, your pores may absorb it and leave tiny black spots.</li>
            <li> as a Midwesterner.. I don&#x27;t tan on my legs and often retain that winter white, which can be odd looking...</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliating glove and Moroccan  Black Soap prior to applying this tanner.  </li>
            <li> However, a few weeks later I noticed a strange smell under the sink and soon discovered the applicator mitt was the culprit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sunless tanners before to only be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> It looked like tiny black spots.</li>
            <li> wait for that to absorb thoroughly first, and then later apply Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried several drug store products that had odd smells or streaked.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell but if you&#x27;re a tanner (whether outside or inside), it smells like tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I am as white as a ghost usually but I am having my engagement pictures taken soon and didn&#x27;t want to blend in with the white skirt I planned on wearing.  </li>
            <li> My mom who typically lectures me about tanning beds was yelling at me last weekend until I told her I haven&#x27;t been in one and</li>
            <li> I am an impatient fair-skinned brunette that can tan if in the sun long enough - but don&#x27;t want the sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I just moisturizer prior to spraying it on and only do small areas at a time,</li>
            <li> I was just looking for less flounder belly white.</li>
            <li> It does have somewhat of a typical self-tanner smell the next day, but only slightly</li>
            <li> I applied it the same way that I did everywhere else, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was just a fluke, but I definitely won&#x27;t use it on my hands again.</li>
            <li> Later On , I Will Use It Again With Less Layers To Achieve The Look I Want .</li>
            <li> It has s slight red hue</li>
            <li> I have already gone through two gloves and still have half a bottle left.  </li>
            <li> so im not sure how this would look on white white people?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not super white.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would complain about is the spray bottle stopped working about half way through.</li>
            <li> I got a shower and rinsed (not scrubbed or washed) and the color faded only ever so slightly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, however, I just rubbed the guide off, nursed my hangover, and made a plan to fake tan again tonight.</li>
            <li> Was super sad after shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super hyped to try Fake Bake Darker &amp; continue using this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical purchasing this, mainly because most of these fake tan products leave me orange</li>
            <li> I have used EVERY self tanner on the market - from drugstore to super expensive - this product blows them all out of the water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have to be applied at least every 3 days to maintain the color, but the small effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> Glynis is dead on when she recommends that you trim the tube, I measured it by sight looking at how much would need to come off just to screw the cap down tightly.</li>
            <li> As far as the mitt goes, it&#x27;s not a very good mitt.</li>
            <li> Only down side is, if you get it wet, it shows.</li>
            <li> It has a strong sweet smell which may turn some off but compared to the horrible smell of other tanning sprays</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the people who posted pictures are wearing the guide color or it doesn&#x27;t work well on very pale skin or if the bottle I boughtwas old (bought on another site),</li>
            <li> I am very pale &amp; tanning in a salon isn&#x27;t for me, this gave me a natural looking tan for the beach.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and after exfoliating this product seemed spotty....</li>
            <li> last very long, need to apply about every 2 days&lt;br /&gt;Color isn&#x27;t very dark</li>
            <li> The only issues are that Fake Bake also recommends you buy so many other products which I found unnecessary, and the color will go pretty dark so if you&#x27;re very pale like me</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one coat doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I likely the mit, although it is a bit small and gets a little gross after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is one arrived opened and made a mess.</li>
            <li> proof;however if you mess up you can use one of those disposable moist facial cleansing cloths to blend the goof into the rest of the tanned area.</li>
            <li> Should have sent it back, but did not want to deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> I always double bag my liquid items, so not too much mess, but it was a shame to lose the product.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get the strange flaking that some other products have.  </li>
            <li> I did have to trim the squirt bottle stem because it was about an inch too long, but other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> In my case the actual dispenser leaked when spraying hence there was always quite a mess everywhere</li>
            <li> From other reviews I learned to cut the spray straw before using because it is too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would think it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I thought that this was going to be a great self tanner.</li>
            <li> Only Con:  keeping the Mir in was a little difficult but not impossible.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, and the initial smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would becareful of is the bottle, leaks really bad, so just make sure it isn&#x27;t turned upside down anywhere.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have trouble with is keeping my legs dry for hours as it cures....  </li>
            <li> Recently I gave up tanning beds, for obvious reasons, but I have very, very pale skin.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, so no more tanning salons for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff works fine but makes your pores look dirty.</li>
            <li> Smell is not bad compared to other fake tan brands.</li>
            <li> Also, if you tend to have dry skin I would absolutely recommend moisturizing like crazy after you rinse off the color guard, before your next application because if I don&#x27;t my skin looks a tiny bit scaly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little orange, unlike the final results once it&#x27;s washed off.</li>
            <li> but I realize that tanning beds and laying outside IS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Wish the color would last a little longer though.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t like the way it faded on me, left little brown spots</li>
            <li> I get a little help with my back</li>
            <li> BBut you are still left with a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> As others stated, just snip a little off of the inner spray tube before use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, just takes a little bit longer to apply with the mitt trying to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Just to give a little back ground.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lasting power has little to be said for.  </li>
            <li> but it still looked semi-normal &amp; gave my pasty white skin a little bit of color, so I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> It gives me just enough color to look like I laid out in the sun but doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, however you will start to get a little orangey brown looking</li>
            <li> It will transfer onto your clothing a little, especially if you sweat during exercise.</li>
            <li> and I only needed a little bit.</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer though.</li>
            <li> Like all self tanners, I would not put on a white bra, tank etc just afterwards because it will stain it a little.</li>
            <li> When it rinses off in the shower the next morning, a little of the excess washes off but doesn&#x27;t affect the color.</li>
            <li> so a little extra tan helps hide the sun spots and imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the color would stay a little longer.</li>
            <li> I only do one single application because I&#x27;m so naturally pale</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t exfoliate enough or my skin was too dry, but fake bake left some parts of my skin pretty blotchy.</li>
            <li> The other reason is that I don&#x27;t feel that the color lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Typically, with other products, I have a hard time getting my whole body tanned evenly, including my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> A little lighter than I had expected, but ordered one for my daughter who is whiter than white and ordered a darker shade for myself..</li>
            <li> The only thing is I did not order the oil and my elbows are a little rough but not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I personally have noticed that if I shave immediately before I put this stuff on that it sinks into my pores a little bit, so if I&#x27;m going to apply this stuff I shave a day or two in advance.</li>
            <li> Once I exfoliated (since i live in Utah where it&#x27;s extremely dry AND have very dry skin, this step is always frustrating, since i cannot ever seem to get every piece of dry skin off of my legs, but I digress.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves tiny little dark specks (like dirt) on my chest - and it does come off on your clothing, no matter how long you wait after applying it to get dressed.</li>
            <li> You can see if you&#x27;ve left any streaks, due to the slight bronze color as you are applying...</li>
            <li> Luckily no one ever sees that area anyways, but for people who wear backless shirts or bikinis or other clothing that shows the back it would be something that they would worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the hard to reach areas on my back.  </li>
            <li> It is hard for me to buff the middle of my back, but that&#x27;s just me &amp; my arms &amp; my anatomy.  </li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;d recommend not doing a vigorous workout in a white shirt 6 hours after putting it on (learned that the hard way, apply it the night before an off day).</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get a very dark tan even with several layers</li>
            <li> The tube for the spray nozzle is a bit too long, just cut it off!!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad as compared to most ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, I love the color</li>
            <li> I read a review about cutting the pump to fit the bottle before use.  </li>
            <li> Also initially the smell is good but the next day even after a shower I could smell that bad fake tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I used it today before work on my arms and feet and my arms look terrible lol.  </li>
            <li> But the benefits far outweigh the one negative.</li>
            <li> It leaves an even, long-lasting tan that is a natural looking color, at least on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;-If the tan looks uneven then use a light lotion to go over the troubled area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is when you shower the next morning a lot of the color does wash off.</li>
            <li> I would really not recommend putting this on at night as the directions say...</li>
            <li> I had spent weeks bleaching age spots and imperfections from my arms &amp; legs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck happened but the product I received was in a PINK bottle with a snap lid</li>
            <li> I get pink.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with hands, feet, and elbows.  </li>
            <li> so we have to be careful around her collarbone area.  </li>
            <li> I recommend wearing dark pajamas, long sleeve shirt and pants.</li>
            <li> Some of the product will rub off and this way it won&#x27;t noticeably stain your pajamas and minimally stains your sheets.</li>
            <li> Iʻve had skin cancer, so I have to be careful and this gives me a bit of color that I canʻt get elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Also after you apply it you will have the tan smell and don&#x27;t get wet</li>
            <li> Have used it a few days and seems I have to go over the same areas that look &amp;#34;missed.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> you get wet AT ALL after applying, splotches and looks like you have a skin disease.</li>
            <li> - Exfoliate - Moisturize - Wet hands - One spray and rub hands together - Apply to a section -</li>
            <li> and let me say, they are almost identical minus the formula which this is a spray and</li>
            <li> I took a shower and yes, some of the color washed off which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I applied it 4 nights in a row and never much color.</li>
            <li> I will continue to build up the color over the next few days.</li>
            <li> This keeps the product from collecting on any rough patches, elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> Well, I wore a tan shirt, and well...there were blotches of pink on my shirt.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts awhile too, longer than I expected it would.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that if you don&#x27;t exfoliate everyday it&#x27;ll build up in some spots and then rub off in the shower or while exercising and stuff.</li>
            <li> With the spray, no matter how I did it, my legs would never really get fully tan looking.</li>
            <li> So my vacations are spent using the highest number sun block every time and no tan.</li>
            <li> It came with a pink applicator that sheaded when I used it.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every self tanner out there, and this one makes me look as if I just spent a week sunning myself on a tropical island.</li>
            <li> both front and back), and even my neck (I&#x27;m 50 and have a few wrinkles).</li>
            <li> Only pit fall is that it is MESSY with over spray.</li>
            <li> Plus, the pump broke (only a few times after use).  </li>
            <li> but you have to be careful to blend well since it is a liquid/spray.</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I like this product for events that don&#x27;t require any sweating or getting wet.</li>
            <li> Careful putting it on your face, though.  </li>
            <li> However, it will rub off on your clothes and everything you touch--especially if you get wet or sweat.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful on my feet/hands/knees/elbows, but that comes with the territory when you&#x27;re talking about a self</li>
            <li> I had suspicions when the product wasn&#x27;t performing as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I always buy a few for later.</li>
            <li> Needs to be reapplied a couple of times a week and be careful of staining your clothing and bedsheets.  </li>
            <li> the buffing glove corrects any mistakes or uneven spots the next day.</li>
            <li> it last a few days.</li>
            <li> The only con is that since it is a spray it can be messy because some spray may get on the wall or floor.</li>
            <li> I can maintain the tan using it only a few times a week.</li>
            <li> and it does not streak or leave uneven patches especially around my chest area.</li>
            <li> And with any self tanner, use carefully on ankles, knees, and elbows.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face after I applied it and woke up with a line that wasn&#x27;t tanned so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful appling.</li>
            <li> Be careful of over-spray in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> but tan runs if u get wet.</li>
            <li> Also I would suggest putting lotion over any rough patches of skin so it won&#x27;t follow the lines of the skin folds.  </li>
            <li> like I had spent a month in the Cancun sun without sun block.</li>
            <li> To use it, you should fold a wet but wrung out wash cloth INTO the pocket, and then roll the cloth and hold it like a baseball or rock in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li> and I look like I&#x27;ve spent about a week in the sun without any of the sun damage.</li>
            <li> Hint: to keep mitt from slipping around while applying just take a rubber band and put it on your wrist over the mitt and it will stay put while applying.</li>
            <li> i spent counless of hours reaearching it</li>
            <li> Secondly, if you don&#x27;t maintain the tan, it sloughs off unevenly.</li>
            <li> Minimal transfer.</li>
            <li> The color begins developing after about 10 minutes on me and gets darker for the next few hours.</li>
            <li> It all depends how often you shower as to how long it stays, but on average about 7-8days.</li>
            <li> And of course careful around knees, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and apply at night, let it sink in for a few minutes then go to bed and shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the posts and even a Youtube video before I spent the money.  </li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The reason this is an issue is that even with careful oversight and the occasional machine wash, your mitt will eventually get pilled and rough and will therefore make your application uneven.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent.</li>
            <li> applied the product a few days in a row (allowing it to stay on my skin a minimum of twelve hours prior to showering) to get the color I wanted</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t showered &amp; you get wet, the product streaks.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the color is the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; and rinses off in the shower, but if you use it a few days in a row you&#x27;ll finally get a tan that stays.</li>
            <li> my only suggestion is to not put it on to heavy as it will streak.</li>
            <li> it literally started to fall apart after a few short uses.</li>
            <li> It only lasts a few days, then you must reapply if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off on anything as if it&#x27;s still wet on my skin.</li>
            <li> But If you get it wet</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with steaks, just be careful with your hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> (I had to carefully remove it).</li>
            <li> If it gets wet you will have water spots.</li>
            <li> And yes, i followed the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still careful because you never know</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for roughly a year.</li>
            <li> If at any time after you put the tanner on during the day you get wet</li>
            <li> When I dried and got dressed, no color was left over on my skin, not even a hint of color.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you are going to be sweating heavily the next day after using this product you will want to shower...with soap...to get all the color guard off otherwise you will sweat the tanner off onto you clothing...</li>
            <li> or if there was a chance I would get wet or be out in the rain....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had success with a self tan product, buy the Fake Bake Flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had success with a self tan product, buy the Fake Bake Flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely no telltale tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I use a thin layer of oil on my skin before I spay on the tanner, which helps me from any splotches which would be very visible on me.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s not real</li>
            <li> i like the tone and no real smell</li>
            <li> Color is not very buildable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it didnt have a 360 spray nozzle plus it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Be careful using it anywhere</li>
            <li> The only con I have is how messy it can be.</li>
            <li> And like any self-tanner it can make those rough knees look darker.  </li>
            <li> so one must be careful applying it so as not to spill it all over the place.</li>
            <li> Im curious if anyone else received this with a purple cap and sprayer?  </li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun for a few weeks (or months in my case, since I have such a time getting a tan).</li>
            <li> And for those of you who are accustomed to applying lotion to your rough spots (knees, elbows, feet, etc.)</li>
            <li> I put my pajamas on shortly after applying Fake Bake and my skin felt soft and had instant color.</li>
            <li> It looks you spent the day at the beach.</li>
            <li> THAN I EVEN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful when you put it on your hands, they will be orange.</li>
            <li> and you can use it for longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Golden Faux Glo-Shimmer, 4.22-Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;3.)  </li>
            <li> That is how some users get the bit of fluff from the mitt on their skin.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful around  </li>
            <li> Second, it is messy.</li>
            <li> Even if you are careful spraying it, it still sort of &amp;#34;mists&amp;#34; all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> And be careful about getting overspray on your floor, clothing.  </li>
            <li> There was minimal scent and the scent that was there</li>
            <li> So either don&#x27;t get wet or shower after it&#x27;s been on for</li>
            <li> Be careful not to accidentally splash yourself where you applied the spray though.</li>
            <li> you do need to be careful</li>
            <li> But, it is an affordable product that lasts me quite a few weeks and actually gives me some color</li>
            <li> Also after you apply it be careful because it will streak or run if you splash water on yourself anywhere that you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just careful.</li>
            <li> so that I&#x27;ll actually wear sun screen and not feel like I&#x27;m missing out on getting color.</li>
            <li> I put it on and I noticed the smell was alright, not my cup of tea, not really into those hawaian tropical scents, but she said there was not that &amp;#34;fake tan smell&amp;#34</li>
            <li> When you put it on, there&#x27;s a darker color guide that keeps you from missing spots (it washes out when you shower the next day, but the tan remains).  </li>
            <li> The product did indeed leave a residue and came off on my sheets (as expected), so I found myself not wanting to use it since there was no convenient times where I wouldn&#x27;t be ruining any garments.</li>
            <li> I like fake bake , I would LOVE fake bake if only it would last longer.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> but can still have a streaky look if not applies carefully.  </li>
            <li> have absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several self tanners, but they are always messy or streaky.  </li>
            <li> but I did spray it one time and then went running a few hours later</li>
            <li> but I did spray it one time and then went running a few hours later</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing is that it can take a few layers to get a medium tan.  </li>
            <li> You can NOT get wet after application.</li>
            <li> Try not to move your arms if they&#x27;re wet still.</li>
            <li> It can be streaky if you arent careful.</li>
            <li> I would be careful about your mustache though.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really supposed to go tanning at the salon</li>
            <li> Not much of a color payoff.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was me, because after a few uses, I received the same result.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and must always look professional and presentable to all, everyday I received at least 2 comments about the tan.</li>
            <li> It did rub off on my sheets, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I like applying it at night because if you get it wet at any point after you apply then you get color streaking.</li>
            <li> Now, I got this bottle 14 days ago, and it is already almost empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very portable as you have the bottle, mitt and gloves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even that expensive and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> it looks like I have spent hours in the tanning bed with just two applications</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO streaking.</li>
            <li> here&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;**I use California Tan Expose lotion the next day and a few days after.</li>
            <li> However, Im discovering as I use it that the lack of self tanner smell may because there is not much self tanning with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A&amp;D Ointment: If you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re legs itch like crazy after applying this stuff, make sure to put a thin layer of A &amp; D ointment wherever is sensitive BEFORE you apply the product.</li>
            <li> The mitt absorbs a lot of the product, and it&#x27;ll last longer if you spray a few times and then rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really one for laying out and doing nothing but soaking up the sun.</li>
            <li> Spots that are often missed:  Ears, behind the ears, neck, back of the neck, underside of arms, tops of feet/toes, tops of hands/toes, and inner and back of thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal smell.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating, and what I figured out, was it would only go on the parts of my skin that the old stuff wasn&#x27;t on at all.</li>
            <li> Also, I suggest buying an extra mitt or two, after a few applications the mitt starts to become rough and causes streaks in the tanner.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge spray tan person and have been a regular tanning bed user but thought maybe I would go this route as it is safer.</li>
            <li> You can always go back if you need to and tan more, but over tanning is annoying to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the next night she reapplied it and looked like she had spent a few days on the beach.</li>
            <li> The applicator works well and not much product is needed so it should last a few months.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product as a base coat.</li>
            <li> To be honest I usually hate self-tanners, but this one exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying</li>
            <li> Does have a nice brown color but must be from a foundation type base.</li>
            <li> There are still drip marks down my bathroom sink and the bottle happened to drip on my arm, which (even wiping it away immediately) left me with a handful of dark drip stains on my arm.</li>
            <li> Dried off completely and applied with included gloves and mitt, and went to bed with very little dry time.</li>
            <li> Seriously the Best fake tan!!!</li>
            <li> We generally only do one application per week because she is so pale.  </li>
            <li> (see my veins kinda pale) blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Yes you, the pale person who has tried all the lotions and wipes but only gets a streaky orange tan.</li>
            <li> I applied it three times the next night, still pale.</li>
            <li> I was pale, German and Irish pale.</li>
            <li> You can apply one night, then apply again the next for a darker color, but if you are really pale, beware, it may turn orange.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale girl, freckles, blue eyes etc.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pale and this is the second year in row</li>
            <li> will definitely be my go to when i&#x27;m feeling pale</li>
            <li> pale white like a trout&#x27;s belly</li>
            <li> Not orangy and im irish pale.</li>
            <li> pale white.</li>
            <li> but they never actually tanned me, probably because I&#x27;m so pale.</li>
            <li> no more walking around naked waiting to dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to apply the product, if not impossible on your back if you&#x27;re doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> This product is my pale easily burned miracle, I mean seriously</li>
            <li> It gave me a natural looking, but not overwhelmingly noticeable, glow!</li>
            <li> There is a right &amp; wrong way to do it...</li>
            <li> i feel healthy i dont look ghostly and sick anymore</li>
            <li> I like this tanner so much, its time to clear out the cabinet and get rid of my collection of self tanner fails!</li>
            <li> I got dressed in a long sleeved black shirt and darker colored leggings and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> The other downside is that the spray is so thin that mitt absorbs so much of the product.  </li>
            <li> You can use it every day or every other day and it takes only a few minutes to put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other self tanners you get in stores, like jergens and a few others they smell like burnt tires..</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but a little difficult to do your back.</li>
            <li> For 2 years I was using Fake Bake original, I had no complaints with that other than sometimes I would feel a little orange</li>
            <li> TOTAL MESS!  </li>
            <li> Love this product just wish it would come with two application mits because the first one gets a little bit nasty by the end of the bottle</li>
            <li> Such a mess!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, and the color is very nice.</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d put down the Walmart crap and give this a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> They say the color running down the drain is only color guard, thats not true.</li>
            <li> They say the color running down the drain is only color guard, thats not true.</li>
            <li> The smell is no longer like coconuts and it does start to smell SLIGHTLY like the typical self-tanner smell, especially if you sweat.</li>
            <li> The mitt I received was a pink, velvet-like material, on one side, and a spongy side (that I never used) on the other.</li>
            <li> Not much into the tanning bed and tried lots of other products...  </li>
            <li> There is a smell but compared to other tanners I found it minimal.</li>
            <li> the only disadvantage is that after you shower a lots of fake tan is gone but it does look very natural!</li>
            <li> Other then that if you can avoid getting it wet</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and have learned that any dark spots instantly come off with a little alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fairly dark color, which I did not want, because I just need a little color, not to look like I actually do spend a ton of time in the sun/tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> So I did some research and came right back to fake bake!</li>
            <li> unless you scrub really hard when you shower, wont last as long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not spray-on, so there are no drips and less potential mess.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions and apply in the shower with shower doors closed after you have dried off, when you step out, simply hose down the inside of the shower.</li>
            <li> Mine were raw red for two hours</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff smells amazing &amp; even after a couple of hours, there is barely any of that nasty self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> The product is sooo easy to apply, virtually impossible to get streaks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a deep, dark tropical tan, you&#x27;ll need to apply it a few nights in a row.</li>
            <li> after one use, the color was a subtle natural color.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and tan very very little naturally</li>
            <li> so you only get to use a little over half the bottle</li>
            <li> each application last a little less than a week (depends on how often your skin exfoliates).  </li>
            <li> I had a big green stripe down my leg.  </li>
            <li> I started with my legs and sprayed a few sprays up and down the front, back, and sides of my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic applicator inside the spray bottle is a little long</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my one MAJOR complaint is the application mit that it came with.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> it was a little bit too long</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes can be a little blotchy, but nothing minor touch-ups can&#x27;t resolve.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The major complaint was the dripping of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Scrub down and dry off, pull up your hair, brush your teeth, get your shaving done... put on gloves &amp; apply!</li>
            <li> It was dark enough to make my pale skin look like I had been tanning for months.</li>
            <li> Tanwise is not a product for the faint of heart - it goes on VERY dark and stains your skin in streaks unless you blend QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Tanwise is not a product for the faint of heart - it goes on VERY dark and stains your skin in streaks unless you blend QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> 15 minutes after it dries then apply lotion, it wont mess it up but will ensure that it stays even and your skin wont dry up.</li>
            <li> (after a few hours you do start to smell a bit of the classic \\&quot; fake tanner smell\\&quot;, but barely noticeable)&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical to try this, as all my &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; tanning experiences have been a major FAIL with gross streaking and peeling...</li>
            <li> long term probley something you apply everyday but its the right color base high lights muscles and cheek bones.</li>
            <li> LOL I made the horrible mistake of spraying it on my FACE and let me tell you, if you have ANY dry skin or healing marks on your face it will grab that color and make you look like you&#x27;ve been in the mud!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have that nasty smell other sunless tanners always get, even after a few hours (as others sometimes develop or have right away).  </li>
            <li> , I read a review about cutting the bottom of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; piece that connects to the spray head and that reviewer is right!</li>
            <li> With a little practice and patience this product is a great alternative to tanning salons which can be inconvenient and spray tan can of course get expensive.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer that though, because too much of a tan on me looks a little weird.</li>
            <li> Three days later and very little fading, even with shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li> It high lights all of your pores, it streaks a little bit, and the worst part for me, on my fore arms/upper arms it doesnt blend at a certain area, nor does it darken the underside of my arm any, no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t look fake or one that takes 10 applications to work but fake bake works great.  </li>
            <li> I know it is hard to decipher real versus fake reviews, but I&#x27;m a 32 year old mom of 2 boys (3 &amp; 1) from Michigan.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not good for sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was my first experience with a self-tanner as I always stayed away from them as they have a reputation to look fake.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers, can not get tan.  </li>
            <li> This was my first year using Fake Bake</li>
            <li> Once this happens, it only gets worse if you try to reapply more self tanner after exfoliating like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have had streaks on my arms due to over spray from water and the rain.  </li>
            <li> , I have not seen any youtube videos or other reviews about this on blogs or anything.</li>
            <li> The third time I used this it turned GREEN!</li>
            <li> so I just hand washed it every other time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I got one leg darker than the other and could not get them to even out.</li>
            <li> so I hope this helps someone else and saves them a lot of time and money spent!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> All other sunless tanning products I have ever purchased have lasted for years.</li>
            <li> and then you can start using it every other day.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I thought it was tedious to have to spray the mit, then rub the stuff in with the mit, yada yada.</li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> other reviewers notice hours after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I think I might just actually use the tanning bed :/.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t break out, which has happened a LOT with other sunless tanners i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I did cut the tube for the sprayer as suggested by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self tanning products and they turned me orange.  </li>
            <li> I prefer other self-tanners</li>
            <li> a tan develops from the inside out, rather than the other way</li>
            <li> From cheap to very expensive.  </li>
            <li> one part of body at a time (one leg, then the other leg, one arm, etc)  </li>
            <li> It dries almost instantly, and doesn&#x27;t have that disgusting self-tanner smell that most similar products have.</li>
            <li> Rubs off...was embarrassed when I t started to rub off due to humid conditions</li>
            <li> I can tolerate this one, but other people can smell it on me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Can fade somewhat quickly, especially if exfoliating (though usually lasts 4-5 days for me).</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t rate it for all-over-body use (I use ALBA or some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand for body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dishwasher gloves to apply other products but still somehow ended up with the dreaded orangey hands.</li>
            <li> little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> This product also go farther than you would think for such a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a brown color rather than orange like other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> I am thinking on my face every other day and maybe a couple times a week on my body.  </li>
            <li> No funky odor like other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> I know some other users commented on how it leaks out of bottle.</li>
            <li> Finally a fake tan that looks real!  </li>
            <li> I will never ever use any other product.</li>
            <li> I will say this product was very different from the creams I used in the past because it is a liquid brown spray you buff into your skin using the mitt</li>
            <li> It has the dha smell like any other sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> The tan is buildable, which unlike some of the other reviews, I like.  </li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable product and at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> So not really sure how I&#x27;m supposed to use the product when it came without a crucial element for use.</li>
            <li> I was careful to rub it in and not leave any streaks or dark areas.  </li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t realize til the next day, resulting in my legs looking like a tanned zebra, and the area where the dripped tanning product pooled--in the arches of my feet and around my heels--made my feet look like I&#x27;ve neither worn shoes nor washed my feet for the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> I took the advice of the other reviewers and snipped the sprayer about an inch, so there was no leaking issues.</li>
            <li> Even after layering every other day for a week, I found that that schedule had to be maintained to retain the color.</li>
            <li> I have to re-apply every other day, but it dries in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to constantly rub it in repeatedly, just a few times will do (like you were rubbing in lotion) and no streaks!  </li>
            <li> (You don&#x27;t even want to know what other method I had to use..)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to add this into my daily/every other day routine, so out the door for me.  </li>
            <li> but I usually wait several hours just in case.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The color lasts longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One other note.  </li>
            <li> First fake tan to provide me a mit</li>
            <li> I agree with the 100&#x27;s of other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I tend to break out in an allergic reaction to all other products</li>
            <li> You should be careful to even apply with the mit around the ankles, elbows, knees as it can pool in dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that it can take some time to get used to how to apply it.</li>
            <li> Staining: this stuff rubs off on clothing / sheets like none other.</li>
            <li> I usually do an application at night, shower the next morning, and then another application.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is the first &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is not like other self tanning items.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers on here, I also recommend exfoliating before using.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend hand washing the mitt every other application.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other posts, the bottle will drip, but I did what another reviewer recommended and cut the plastic tubing about 1/2 inch</li>
            <li> Other than that you can get dressed almost immediately after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t get my hands evenly and one was darker than the other.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the summer about every other day</li>
            <li> you would have to apply it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have to apply it every day or every other day for my skin to keep the tan.</li>
            <li> I am half black and half white.</li>
            <li> This ranges from L&#x27;Oreals Sublime Bronze lotions/sprays, to Model Co. products, to Xen Tan, and lots of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have read other reviews complaining that the color washes off.  </li>
            <li> but other than that i like it.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every other day for a week, and then once a week after that for the rest of the summer (unless it looks like I need touch-ups).</li>
            <li> I used this for my winter wedding when I&#x27;m usually pasty white.</li>
            <li> My recommendation, do it two days in a row and then start doing it every other day just to keep up the color,</li>
            <li> I even tried other spray tans.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell like I was cooking from the inside like the other self tanners smell to me.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s only after I get lazy about applying it</li>
            <li> But now I can look as if I spent time at the beach!...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it on my fingers and toes but other</li>
            <li> IDK WHAT THEESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT &amp;#34;SHEDDING&amp;#34; AND LEAVES MARKS..</li>
            <li> I found the gradual lotions took too long (sometimes weeks), the sprays were uneven and stained clothes and they all reeked.  </li>
            <li> so hold it up to the bottle and cut it, other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The inside needs to be plastic or some other non-porous material.</li>
            <li> the results are like nothing I&#x27;ve ever gotten before from other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a fake tan product.</li>
            <li> One last thing I have a medium olive skin tone so not sure how it would work on a paler person.</li>
            <li> I threw out all the other junk self tanners in my cabinet.  </li>
            <li> No one has walked up to me and noticed that I became extremely tan in a day, that would be unnatural.</li>
            <li> No smell, and the color it leaves is brown, not orange like other brands tend to do.</li>
            <li> application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read tips from other users and agree with the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am returning the other 11 boxes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a skin product that expires on me than one that is everlasting due to parabens.  </li>
            <li> You HAVE to exfoliate &amp; hydrate your skin for an even color, just like with any other tanning product or tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t get any other product</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Ever other self tanner I have tried has turned me orange and stung my eyes, not to mention smelled wierd.</li>
            <li> Apply every other day by using the brown mitt that is included.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as orange-y as other products I&#x27;ve tried, but nothing to scream and rant and rave about.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bash the product, but it&#x27;s not impervious to the drawbacks one would experience with other products.</li>
            <li> I used it according to directions and even though other raving reviewers chalk up dissatisfaction to \\&quot;not using it correctly,\\</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> like other products tend to leave you with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to just apply the tanner every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product staining sheets, shirts, or any other clothing.  </li>
            <li> and if anyone has ANY stretch marks, they will be extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I put it on every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, Jergen&#x27;s and Loreal Sublime.</li>
            <li> I have to apply every other day (sometimes every day) to get some color and the darker</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned the mitt falling apart...</li>
            <li> Also it  clogs my pores like some other self tan products do.</li>
            <li> Follow these steps EXACTLY, no matter what you may have read, and I promise it will turn out \\&quot;flawless\\</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come out orange and streaky like a lot of other self</li>
            <li> and I have to apply about every other day or every three days.</li>
            <li> I have always tanned in a tanning bed until I had a spot removed off of my chest due to sun damage.</li>
            <li> With some of the other spray tans is takes 4-8 hours for color to develop.</li>
            <li> other benefit compared to something like Tan Towels</li>
            <li> Also, like all of the others it looks like you have spots when it starts to wear off, which is sooner than some other brands.</li>
            <li> and you have to reapply every day to every other day.</li>
            <li> Other words it lays in the wrinkles on your face or marks that should not be there.</li>
            <li> I will never again buy any other self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looks blotchy and gets into my pores which is something I&#x27;ve never had a problem with with any other self tanners.</li>
            <li> There is no orange, I don&#x27;t know why other reviews say this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge or turn orange like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Unlike other tanning products, this wont turn you orange.</li>
            <li> I used his every other day after I showered.</li>
            <li> we have both used countless other products in the past.</li>
            <li> It smelled just like all the other self tanners, stinky.</li>
            <li> I will never but another sunless tanning product other than this....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with any other product that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other ppl comment on doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d literally have to be applying every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> Just like other self tanners, you have to follow the directions</li>
            <li> A little about me, I am very white, and I mean WHITE.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like how it makes my face look due to my oily</li>
            <li> Like all of the other reviews, I have to give this 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Other than that the color was alright.  </li>
            <li> At first I was wary of the pump spray bottle but it works well.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten away with just washing my hands with other self tanners but the one time I tried it without the glove I had to get out the scrub brush, won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> , i use it every other day along with salon tanning .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this really disappointed me, I still love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Stained a bathroom rug but has come out of all other fabrics.</li>
            <li> My bottle dripped also, like other reviews said.</li>
            <li> any other tanning stink but</li>
            <li> Every other day so that I can moisturize in between.</li>
            <li> Other products I have tried end up looking orange or leave me with streaks and missed spots.</li>
            <li> This fake bake does exactly what it</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;you will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> deff not the orangy color ive gotten from other spray tans ive tried.</li>
            <li> After wearing this product for a little while it does get a typical self tanner smell but it is a soft scent and not nearly as overwhelming as other self tanners.</li>
            <li> With this you&#x27;re supposed to apply it and leave it for 5(ish) hours then rinse off (in the mean time be prepared for a STRONG sunless tanner smell and a weird brown color).</li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin looks a little dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only done a little touch-up on a few areas</li>
            <li> i followed the directions and sprayed on the glove and then rubbed it on myself - it left a few streak marks and were a little blotchy ..</li>
            <li> Also, this scared me into being very, very careful as I applied.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with application so that you don&#x27;t drip it on your rugs.  </li>
            <li> Very messy to apply and stains everything, just go pay for a spray tan or two at your local tanning salon!</li>
            <li> One application was enough to look like I&#x27;d spent days in the sun but again no orange tones or streaks, and I started PALE PALE.</li>
            <li> You do have to be very careful and sparse applying around elbows, knees, hands, shin-bone (I have bony shins) and feet.</li>
            <li> So as others have said, you must be very careful, because you can get streaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have spots that have less color than others (which I had no matter how carefully I applied other stuff).  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not orange at all, and I could detect no smell other than the slightly fruity, tropical scent.</li>
            <li> Remember to use a small amount of lotion, (not like you would normally moisturize) on heels, ankle bones, knees and elbows so that these areas do not get overly dark!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be my new secret weapon.</li>
            <li> As a natural redhead with corpse-like pale skin, I need fake and bake in order to feel like a normal person during the summer and not look like the walking dead.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t smell bad either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bad at this sort of thing, and even I found this easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The product dried almost immediately, not pacing around waiting for a cream to dry</li>
            <li> Yet, when I applied the FakeBake using the dried mitt, the same green color appeared.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Use the soft side of the MIT to rub in not the white side also anyone stating they don&#x27;t get color or it washes off is applying wrong</li>
            <li> Nothing super crazy, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I spent way too much money on airbrush tanning and spray tan booths which yeilded mediocre results.</li>
            <li> The bottle does leak just a bit when you spray it, so simply trim the extra unnecessary length off of the spray tube so that the end just touches the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> A monkey can do it but its not easy to apply on the face.  </li>
            <li> BUT ONLY if you have small pours if not you have dark spots where ur hair grows and I have this</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t active during the six hour curing period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you let it dry for a few seconds</li>
            <li> The product is dry within a few seconds so you can get dressed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Be careful with how thick you apply and definitely exfoliate before applying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only two downsides are that the mitt is not very good, and that is does stain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the unlucky few with body chemistry that exacerbates the scent of every single self tanner I&#x27;ve tried EXCEPT for this one.</li>
            <li> after I saw a lot of positive reviews of the Fake Bake on YouTube I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> So after reading the positive reviews on this one, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving and exfoliating and donning latex gloves, I sprayed the Fake Bake onto my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and i applied one coat and instantly looked tan and not orange whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin that only burns in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and only burn in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, never tan only burn.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I guess I am just going to be very pale from now on because my body just turns red instead of tanning when I am in the sun darn it !</li>
            <li> I have red hair and very pale skin.</li>
            <li> I listened to other reviewers and slept on a dark sheet and showered in the morning...</li>
            <li> I will admit though that I was intimidated by some of the other reviews &amp; the product information concerning the prep &amp; how dark it might be.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the cost versus other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Used the gloves so less product was left on the mitt and wasted!  </li>
            <li> I did what one of the other reviewers mentioned by snipping the straw down a bit to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li> The only drawback with the brown mitt is that after multiple applications over a while it has started breaking down a little, what I mean is that little pieces of the mitt come off.</li>
            <li> I love Fake bake!!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I feel like the glove is a little small in length (or I just have big hands)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use it regularly, I would recommend exfoliated at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, my pale, freckly, self has tried and been disappointed with many other self tanners out there.</li>
            <li> careful when you apply the color onto your wrists, since you want to blend it into your hands...it can get a little tricky to create that blended</li>
            <li> It retains a little color but nothing remotely close to how it looks after application.  </li>
            <li> You can keep building it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a self tanner that had such dramatic results instantly.</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut, not like other tanning cream or sprays which smell odd.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink &amp; takes half the time to apply as any other self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> its a little scary trying a tanner the first time</li>
            <li> That thing is so hard to hold on to, especially while you have the rubber gloves</li>
            <li> I just recently tried the 60 minute version and it gave me hardly any color.</li>
            <li> Usually I use the spray tan from cvs (the one with the legs on the can), so this was a little bit different.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t push too hard on the mitt though</li>
            <li> I have always had SUCH a hard time with self tanners.</li>
            <li> Faulty mitt, hard to apply on back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be cleaning and applying this at the same time..</li>
            <li> If you have rough areas (knees, elbows) use a little salt scrub oil on them before you apply this product or it&#x27;ll make the areas too dark.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s hard to put it on your feet without it looking blotchy.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the Mitt is that it is hard to keep on your hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spray it only on the glove.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of dry skin, so when I applied it to my legs it was getting a little streaky.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners in the past with bad results.</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll get dark streaks.</li>
            <li> the years, now in my 40&#x27;s and have never found one that A. didn&#x27;t turn me orange, B, wasn&#x27;t too dark for alabaster, C,</li>
            <li> I purchased sunlabs ultra dark.</li>
            <li> goes on evenly but doesnt give u as dark of a color as i would like from how lengthy a process it is to get it on ...</li>
            <li> Not too dark so that the fade isn&#x27;t so noticeable, but plenty dark for this time of year.  </li>
            <li> and you are never as dark when you use them.  </li>
            <li> To makes matters worse, every hair follicle was clearly darker than the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t freak out when you look in the mirror at your face and see how dark it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on really dark</li>
            <li> Did not get as dark as I wanted.</li>
            <li> At home tanners never got me as dark and were all streaky when applied.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> but at least I&#x27;m not white!!</li>
            <li> The only negative is the overspray so you have to pay attention where you are when you apply</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the &amp;#34;color guide&amp;#34; is too domineering and runny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on at least my 5th application, the last two times I&#x27;ve gone over everything twice</li>
            <li> color absorbs well into the skin, not too dark.</li>
            <li> color doesn&#x27;t go on as dark as I thought it would based on reviews, but you can see where it&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li> mine way too dark n</li>
            <li> There was a VERY faint color remaining--not enough to really notice or to get me to buy this product again.  </li>
            <li> I was very reluctant and skeptical of turning some funky orange color.</li>
            <li> You can manage how dark you want to go and it doesn&#x27;t give you a orange tint.</li>
            <li> I showered and still was dark</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get really dark</li>
            <li> The color guard is dark but it does not look fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am finally dark.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing fake bake flawless, as every self tanning product has failed me in the past.</li>
            <li> so your hands don&#x27;t take on a dark color.</li>
            <li> The color when you put it on is dark</li>
            <li> Because it makes even the lightest skin dark and doesnt smell.</li>
            <li> i get DARK.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to be ultra dark brown you need to apply it everyy night until you reach the desired color and then maintain it once a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you are supposed to wait to show because the packaging does not say</li>
            <li> One or two applications there, and my hands were as dark as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you WON&#x27;T be that dark at all as it gets lighter as you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing is, It washes off, without leaving a existing tan,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already close to having the color I want,not too dark for the winter</li>
            <li> It goes on in a dark brown</li>
            <li> but, my legs are never as dark as the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> Nothing will make me dark.</li>
            <li> Not golden as it goes on but does tan.</li>
            <li> It does stain hair follicle pores on your legs though making you took like you have dark stubble.</li>
            <li> It really looked fake.</li>
            <li> Looks real and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> I say that because after you apply it, you will look DARK.</li>
            <li> Always exfoliate before using so you don&#x27;t get any dark splotches and moisturize after showering off the color-guard.</li>
            <li> I can control how dark I get as well, by reapplying product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s likely the least time-consuming product you can buy, and it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Having to put this product on every day and having to smell it on you all the time is not worth it to me; it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;deal breaker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My past experience with self tanners had left me with orange hands, uneven areas and streaks.  </li>
            <li> I go between this and St. Tropez dark mousse...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I need to wait at least ten minutes after application to put on a bra, otherwise the straps get stained brown.</li>
            <li> Wait at least ten minutes before applying moisturizer or make up so that you don&#x27;t smudge the product.</li>
            <li> and I used unscented lotion before I applied to keep knees, elbows, and ankles from being too dark.  </li>
            <li> K Xen-Tan Dark Lotion, 8-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> You can build up your tan to how dark you want to be.</li>
            <li> There is not a hint of orange to the color, and gives you a buildable, dark tan if that&#x27;s the look you desire.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark and blends well with the mitt.</li>
            <li> so i really hope fake bake doesnt do that.</li>
            <li> only complaint is I dislike the coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> I have had no streaks or dark spots while using this product.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not too dark.  </li>
            <li> You cAn use this product over and over until you are as dark as you want to be.</li>
            <li> It comes out WAY to dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare Fake Bake to St. Tropez cause of that</li>
            <li> the color I get with Fake Bake is so much nicer than the salon.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The juice is not worth the squeeze.\\&quot;  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It does make you dark</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to wear lotion or perfume because of those reviews but the spray is just too dark.</li>
            <li> going into this summer I&#x27;ve decided to take care of my skin while I&#x27;m still young, but that means no more golden tan :(</li>
            <li> Shows up dark</li>
            <li> was recommended the fake bake by the beauty supply store I shop at, and I find amazons price very comparable.</li>
            <li> (I.e. dark hair follicules, razor burn, scars, etc.)</li>
            <li> For those with dark hair, that will show even once you shave, this is still not the product we are needing and looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I have also used with the Xen Tan blending balm with no success.</li>
            <li> Thanks to fake bake I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> It took me about 2-3 applications to get a fairly dark tan.</li>
            <li> that it looks dark</li>
            <li> It does stain clothing, so wear dark clothes until u shower.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is really picky when it comes to fake tans (he hates them)</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 different self-tanners, spray tan at the tanning salon, Mystic Tan, Versa tan, and none of them come CLOSE to this</li>
            <li> usually do this a few (3 or 4) nights in a row, then after that, only once or twice a week for maintenence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color isnt as dark as I thought it would be...</li>
            <li> If you want a really dark tan you can build it and use it a couple days in a row.</li>
            <li> No orange fake looking color at all, lasts very well and does not rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> It make me look REALLY dark</li>
            <li> but it was also the dark color guard, woke up in the morning</li>
            <li> So yes, you are not as dark, but that is how it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple applications to get as dark as I wanted, but of course, like everything it just took some time and experimenting with.</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been developing a farmer tan up here (since it&#x27;s never warm enough to wear a bathing suit).  </li>
            <li> and I have tried at least 8 different products</li>
            <li> I was scared that I would look orange or unnaturally dark after using it, but that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the color</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it starts to fade after 24 hours</li>
            <li> Now, to the one big negative I have to mention...</li>
            <li> Also, what kinda sucks is after your done and naked, if you accidentally splash water on you..</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> &gt; my only complaint is that I feel like the color plateaued.</li>
            <li> But it turns out that Fake Bake doesn&#x27;t give me much color at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to Neutrogena Micro Mist (the dark shade) and I use it with Xen Blending Balm, which helps the color not to collect on your ankles and elbows.</li>
            <li> as fake tanners go this works pretty well put it&#x27;s rally messy.</li>
            <li> Just like the darker one but not to dark.</li>
            <li> You get the dark bronze from Fake Bake with the DHA and intense moisture from Moist Hemp Bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li> You can build the color from a light/medium tan to dark.</li>
            <li> And since it goes on dark there is no streaking.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sticks to some of the pores on my legs.</li>
            <li> Watch your joints because they can get too dark.  </li>
            <li> I applied 3x a week to keep myself dark like I</li>
            <li> MUCH easier to use than this Fake Bake situation.  </li>
            <li> I say that to point out I don&#x27;t need a dark tan, I&#x27;ve never done the tanning bed or anything like that</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell at first, but after a few hours, that fake tanner smell comes.</li>
            <li> just your average person.  </li>
            <li> Not as dark as I had anticipated</li>
            <li> : It isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> It still isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Product smells good, like coconut sunscreen...until you sweat, then its nasty.</li>
            <li> The minimal tan it does gives fades within a few days.</li>
            <li> A couple hours before bed, shower and shave and use a rough exfoliating glove to remove surface dead skin.  </li>
            <li> The mitt and glove are a game changer as far as application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tan either, I&#x27;ve spent and wasted a lot of money on tanning packages...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few self-tanners before and never really found one that worked as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Careful around your wrist wrinkles and not too heavy on elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> Hate to say it but better than the SUN laboratories lotion</li>
            <li> It goes on smelling good but eventually turns into that nasty self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> :) if you hate waiting days or weeks to get tanned, then this is the product to get as a self tanner.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the results were way too subtle, in fact, so subtle that under certain lighting conditions, it appeared non-existent.  </li>
            <li> No more completely pale winter white skin for me!  </li>
            <li> Not very comfortable on your hand, and after a couple of uses it began erode, pieces were coming off, it was leaving &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; on my body.</li>
            <li> A little gose a long ways and it doesn&#x27;t make you Orange!!!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend to anyone starting out or who is skeptical like me!</li>
            <li> We are talking ivory with pink undertones pale skin.</li>
            <li> I grew very impatient with jergens because it took way too long to build up any color and</li>
            <li> once pale legs are now a sun-kissed brown with absolutely no streaks.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the least bit orange, but after a week and a half, it started to fade and made me look like a brown and white Dalmatian.</li>
            <li> The only half complaint I have is with the mitt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to mess this one up, especially with the mit.</li>
            <li> The mitt is an added bonus, to not having to scrub your hands down after.</li>
            <li> Once I cut down the tube, this problem was solved.  </li>
            <li> Even after trimming the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; it leaks down around the nozzle and gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> I cut the spray hose down so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li> so you need to maintain somewhat, but hands down</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m trying to cut down on that</li>
            <li> I had to then wipe down my bathroom.</li>
            <li> B0013OJWE2 Neutrogena Micro-Mist Sunless Tanning Spray Medium - 5.3 oz]] in which I had drip marks down my calves</li>
            <li> Shower in the morning and wash any residue down the drain.  </li>
            <li> the product down a bit?</li>
            <li> it pills and breaks down verily</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hands down.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll see the brown streaks running down your legs when the bronzer rinses off.  </li>
            <li> A pain in the butt when you need to shower / shave and can see your tan flushing down the drain.</li>
            <li> Some of the color stays but a lot goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> This would cut down on applications from once a day to maybe twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you can wash down the walls.</li>
            <li> Showered when I woke up and all the color went down the drain.</li>
            <li> they need to tone down that smell.  </li>
            <li> So either spray onto mit or stand in shower to spray yourself down.</li>
            <li> so I could just sit down</li>
            <li> With the microfiber mit I worked the liquid into my skin by using a circular motion and sparingly spreading it down over to the tops and sides of my feet.</li>
            <li> If this item was not watered down it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the shower like a make shift spray booth and just spray the walls down when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Every time you shower you literally see the dye and your money going down the drain</li>
            <li> Almost 50% of it washes down the drain.</li>
            <li> Put a towel down as your floors will be covered with a brown layer if you do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I got it out of the box I just sprayed it into the glove that&#x27;s provided and wiped myself all down.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and trimmed the straw part of the pump a little bc</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is now my must have beauty product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens self tanner foams, and other products; they do not compare!</li>
            <li> Does not make me smell or have sticky clogged skin like other lotion based ones do!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not rub off on my clothes, or bedding (bedding is all white, BTW) and it doesn&#x27;t have that toxic tan smell, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t image using any other self-tanner now!</li>
            <li> Be careful!!</li>
            <li> The mitt they provide extremely helps with the application!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that amout any other products!</li>
            <li> I have used the original Fake Bake lotion and was satisfied with the results, just not the gawd awful smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product ,all the  other self tanners are history!</li>
            <li> Ive tried other products that are easier to apply but they made me turn orange!</li>
            <li> &quot; I mean all the ones that you can buy at your local drug store.  </li>
            <li> I planto be a lifelong customer!!</li>
            <li> ONLY small complaint I have is the lotion seems to last longer, but I found that if I just reapply a little in the morning and keep myself moisturized, it extends the life of the tan.&lt;br /&gt;You will save yourself a ton of time and money if you buy this product!</li>
            <li> drying with a towel you must pat yourself dry, rubbing excessively will make the tan fade (this goes for all unnatural tanning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small child and don&#x27;t have time to wait for a self tanner to dry or have loads of time to apply it.</li>
            <li> I did notice like two small spots on my face that were darker than the rest of my face, but my skin could be really dry in that area</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion/Deep Dark Color &amp; it</li>
            <li> usually I do with other products I&#x27;ve used, no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fabulous and I have a Bahamas-esque tan that isn&#x27;t orange or fake looking in the least!</li>
            <li> NOT SUPER DARK</li>
            <li> NOT SUPER DARK</li>
            <li> It lasts a little less than a week, but you can reapply it every other day or so for a gradual tan look.</li>
            <li> I am seriously thinking about just getting rid of my spray machine and doing fake bake full time cause</li>
            <li> Also have wasted money on other self tanners.</li>
            <li> If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like some other products.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blending balm that a few other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> I would be dead due to the amount of stains this would put in my house.</li>
            <li> have been reading some other reviews and others are describing the color as green when they put it on.  </li>
            <li> It smells ok but after awhile it can become annoying and starts to smell like normal fake tans do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other users are talking about when their skin turns green.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with getting it all over like other people say.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is it fades a little odd, splotchy and almost flakes off.</li>
            <li> No need to bake in the sun when you can get the same color in less time and less wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle was about two years old, and the fact that it went bad means it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Everything was brown and the bottle was leaking and half gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a slight scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I typically use St. Tropez spray.  </li>
            <li> While the skin did lighten slightly, it was a lot darker than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you wake up the next day you can definitely smell the fake tanner smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super greasy.  </li>
            <li> Also his part takes less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> this stuff turned me an odd color.</li>
            <li> and i wanted to get a spray tan, but i was scared of turning orange or some odd color, so i saw this product and decided to give it a try.....</li>
            <li> I wanted to have a slight glow.  </li>
            <li> I ended up paying quite a bit less than the others mentioned they had paid.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have black sheets, pillowcase, and comforter, I don&#x27;t suggest wearing this to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed it, and it stopped with the dirt, but still, the texture is a bit odd now.</li>
            <li> Typical self tanner smell ...</li>
            <li> Which is odd, it pigments your skin but not your bedding or clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle (purchased in January 2015)</li>
            <li> If you have any veins that are visible and just want to wear less foundation or concealer, this is helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the day I was in 100+ temperature, so of course a lot of the tanner transferred to my clothes (I choose a black dress, so i wasn&#x27;t too concerned) but that night I threw everyting in the washer</li>
            <li> This claims to not have the typical smell of sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li> BUT it looks horrible on parts of the body with creases, such as elbows, ankles, neck, wrist, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that frustrates me the most</li>
            <li> or you do have a slightly sweaty smell during the day if used after your shower in the morning, just saying.</li>
            <li> It also helps even out in the summer for the areas that get less sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does have the typical &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell after awhile</li>
            <li> Whoever gives this less than 5 stars should just stop tanning.</li>
            <li> Not super stinky like some.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;edit:can be manageable, just needs less juice at once and faster, even rubbing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought the fake bake spray three times now this last time was from a different seller</li>
            <li> I finally put fake bake on and instantly was wayyyy darker</li>
            <li> but none the less</li>
            <li> so you lose less.</li>
            <li> I would use at night because if you put it on and went out you smelled odd.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t really blame Fake Bake for an uneven tan.  </li>
            <li> Why are so many fake tanners so ridiculously expensive?  </li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake for years and have now moved on to using Fake Bake, Darker (which i freakin&#x27; love).</li>
            <li> Goes on black.</li>
            <li> Typically it lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> going on, it does have that odd smell after some time.</li>
            <li> These patches were subtle enough that I don&#x27;t think anyone would have noticed.  </li>
            <li> Half of the product is in the shower...</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter (at about half the price) and she loves it too.  </li>
            <li> I still tan but less.</li>
            <li> Way less orange than a lot of products out there.</li>
            <li> Self tanner has to be 50/50, that is half formulation and half application technique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive toned and this color came out slightly too orange for my liking.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake left streaks on my chest so as I&#x27;ve said above - use a bronzer specifically for the face.</li>
            <li> I tried the tanning beds but it would take me 10 sessions just to get a slight color.</li>
            <li> For less than $13 it cost way less than tanning at a salon.</li>
            <li> After using banana boat self tanner all last year and not knowing that there was a self tanner out there for less then 30 bucks that wouldnt turn you that fake orangey color i continued to use it all throughout the year even though i knew how gross it looked</li>
            <li> I cannot get a tan; I burn, or turn a sort of odd orangish color.</li>
            <li> At least a few months of solid use, but perhaps even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a faint enough color the next day.  </li>
            <li> At the end of each day i still have the typical fake-tan-smell in my nose.</li>
            <li> Most of the tanners i&#x27;ve used either didn&#x27;t leave enough color, turned out orange, had that terribly unattractive smell, or came out splotchy/streaky.</li>
            <li> Also I felt less sticky after the application.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I seriously cannot get enough of this.</li>
            <li> I would typically SWEAR by this product.</li>
            <li> This could be due to me being lazy and not washing the mitt (could be the residual bronzer from other applications).</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Fake Bake products, is that they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I typically leave it on my face for an hour or two then wash it off before bed.</li>
            <li> I found it slightly on the yellow/golden side</li>
            <li> and my fingers were like black, but i put alcohol on them and cleared them up this morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super blotchy, it&#x27;s not oiley</li>
            <li> I like how it takes less than 5 minutes to apply</li>
            <li> The rubber gloves typically tear before I finish the bottle</li>
            <li> I typically rely on the reviews when choosing between products.</li>
            <li> I seriously cant say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, a way to show people that you are as fake on the outside as you are on the inside!</li>
            <li> It looks like my typical tan.</li>
            <li> Almost $10 less than you would pay at Ulta.</li>
            <li> A week and a half or two weeks?  </li>
            <li> My advice for this product is to get the mitt slightly damp before rubbing on skin.</li>
            <li> The tan lasted about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> When I woke up I smelt like chocolate once again not your typical tanner.</li>
            <li> I spray the the Fake Bake on the back of my hands, one or two spritzes on each hand, and then put a deep moisturizer on with it and rub it all in together.</li>
            <li> I spray the the Fake Bake on the back of my hands, one or two spritzes on each hand, and then put a deep moisturizer on with it and rub it all in together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half of your skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half of your skin tone.</li>
            <li> The product will settle in the blemish and make it look like a black dot.</li>
            <li> almost half the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> I examined my former milky white legs and couldn&#x27;t help but stare with a cheesy grin on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of fake tanning.</li>
            <li> nc30 and This just gave me a slight shade darker.</li>
            <li> all the self tanners I have tried previously made me look oompa loompa orange or they were that and streaky...</li>
            <li> less clean-up afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale (think printer paper) which is normally a state I don&#x27;t mind, but I get bored sometimes and enjoy altering my appearance, and that&#x27;s where this stuff is, normally I&#x27;m clumsy with self tanner and end up a blotchy, uneven weird looking mess.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even took the tips about cutting stem of the spray nozzle and did not have any issues with the product spilling down or around the sides.</li>
            <li> I applied a little moisturizer to feet, hands, knees, and elbows to avoid any dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have little dark dots all over my legs from the tanner getting in my follicles on days</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it all out, when you use it again it will leave little dark brown specs that are coming off the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it all out, when you use it again it will leave little dark brown specs that are coming off the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; your skin rather than developing it with the DHA, which is weird because DHA is high on the list of the ingredients, which is what develops your tan...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend fake bake to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using fake tanner since high school.</li>
            <li> From high end like Clarins to Neutrogena and random overseas ones like Sienna Sol.</li>
            <li> I have very pink, pale skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Excess spray can make a slight mess in your bathroom (but it takes 5 seconds to wipe away with a wipe or papertowel)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a die hard St. Tropez person for a long while.</li>
            <li> And once you get down towards the bottom of the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t apply well, turns into little balls when you try and apply it</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to have a little of your color wash down the drain each time you shower after applying.</li>
            <li> and it was suggested to cut the pump tube down a little bit so it fits into the bottle.</li>
            <li> , I washed my hands and a drip ran down my leg, giving me a little streak mark.</li>
            <li> A bit messy and a little difficult to get even, but dries fast with no color transfer.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its a little messy.</li>
            <li> A lot of the color will come off in the shower (you will probably be about half as tan after showering), so you might want to apply two coats if you want a darker tan and don&#x27;t be afraid of the color you develop because it will fade a lot in the first shower.</li>
            <li> still give 5 stars because its hard to find a even streak free \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> Company says it &amp;#34;fades&amp;#34; away which is not true.</li>
            <li> I washed the mitt in the sink with dish soap and hoped that would be the end of the dark kermit-like green color.</li>
            <li> oh and if you mess up and wanna get this dye out, use a hand sanitizer</li>
            <li> omg, can you imagine the mess on your clothes not to mention the jokes.....</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it was a mess, not true.</li>
            <li> however, I went a head and bought the fake bake cream I normally buy.</li>
            <li> Thought the spray would be a mess, but no biggy at all.</li>
            <li> you can go to sleep (bed) and not worry about a mess.</li>
            <li> I first read about Fake Bake, I though the included mitt would be gimmicky, so I always ignored it in the past.</li>
            <li> body took 30 minutes and was a streaky mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the 30 minutes it took to cover my body the bathroom was a mess.</li>
            <li> The mitten makes application a breeze and does not leave a mess.</li>
            <li> In 5 min you can get dressed and it doesn&#x27;t mess up your tan or leave lines.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a mess.</li>
            <li> no streaking, not alot of mess,</li>
            <li> Also, this product turned into a blotchy mess when I used it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> i dont see how you can mess up because i even did my hands and feet</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions you will truly look as though you were on a week&#x27;s vacation in a tropical climate - without the dangerous exposure to UV rays or the need to sit for hours under the hot rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li> It continued to leak every time I pumped, and made a gawd-awful mess.</li>
            <li> what a mess.</li>
            <li> The stuff can rub off, and if you sweat, that may mess it</li>
            <li> (I heard washing machines &amp; dryers mess the mitts up)</li>
            <li> and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> I have never had a mess up since I have had it.</li>
            <li> Oh I was a bit of a streaky mess</li>
            <li> Or else you will be a splotchy mess.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle can do quite a mess so get in the shower to apply.</li>
            <li> and boy was it a mess.</li>
            <li> It has a dark color guard it is messy</li>
            <li> If you have even a hint of any sort of other product on your skin -- lotion, makeup, deodorant, deodorant that wasn&#x27;t scoured off with a freakin&#x27; loofah -- then it will turn that area green and it will stain the pad and turn anything else it touches green, too.</li>
            <li> My real trouble spot is my ankles and as long as there&#x27;s some lotion on there</li>
            <li> Although the nozzle is a little tricky and has a slight hiccup in the manufacturing ..</li>
            <li> I applied one coat and it made me slightly darker, but not a significant tan.  </li>
            <li> Others have said it makes their pores look like little black dots.  </li>
            <li> Just a little less ghostly.</li>
            <li> used it Monday then Thursday for retouch on Saturday when I wore my little black dress</li>
            <li> The instant color is so helpful, the deepening is slight and it hardly smells!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy because it&#x27;s a spray, but I just lay a towel down or use it in the shower stall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the chemicals are, but something is definitely not right!</li>
            <li> or else it will dry and be hard to blend.</li>
            <li> * Shower your body (not hair, don&#x27;t want water dripping) using exfoliating showergloves and scrub your dry parts hard.</li>
            <li> I also found that with someone having dark hair and pale skin if not out in the sun, even this product cannot hide my bodies imperfections.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dark, which we like because we&#x27;re so pale</li>
            <li> I will be trying the one from Fake bake company this week once all my orange skin disappears to see if the poor color is from the product being old, non genuine or just that fake bake</li>
            <li> Also to add I am not fair skinned, I tan easily, but I am pale during these cold months.</li>
            <li> I live with my girlfriend, and she doesn&#x27;t even know my tan is fake.</li>
            <li> The fake bake oil spray did not arrive in time, so I just used the new Suave spray.</li>
            <li> However, it is much less messy.</li>
            <li> I never have to order this type of product from out of the US ever again - as long as the formula of this specific Fake Bake remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wipe fast because it does dry fast-I like that though because I hate waiting on a self tanner to dry before putting my clothes on.  </li>
            <li> So the only color I got was the base color when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> The glove that comes with it gets pretty dirty after a few times of using it, but no biggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; and you can look dirty at first.</li>
            <li> It was so easy and idiot proof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than I wanted getting here</li>
            <li> The liquid had a tendency to settle into pores and hair follicles leaving little brown dots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you have it on and you get even a little overheated</li>
            <li> I did a little research and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> but the color did sweat off a little.</li>
            <li> I do want a little color on my legs when wearing skirts, capris, and shorts.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat it for the price and the dark brown tan!</li>
            <li> It works no better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> gets me so dark and lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> I also found there to be little to no smell as it develops-</li>
            <li> the mitt didn&#x27;t flake/shed (like, little pillings off of the mitt/left on your skin)</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after a shower and a little rubs off on my sheets, but not anything that can&#x27;t be washed out.</li>
            <li> so it takes little time.</li>
            <li> However, the mitt gets a little worn out before the bottle is out.</li>
            <li> It was still usable, but had little pills on it that caused streaking.</li>
            <li> DO follow the directions though --put a little moisturizing lotion on elbows, knees, hands and feet</li>
            <li> A little perfume</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone and had a little bit of a farmer&#x27;s tan going on.</li>
            <li> or else you may have little brown spots in those areas.</li>
            <li> the mitt they give you gets a little worn</li>
            <li> I have tried other sunless tanning products in the past and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> so I had to improvize a little and even with the delay of trying to rig something up</li>
            <li> I went without face tanners for awhile until I thought - I need to start tanning my face a little in these winter months.</li>
            <li> i  was a little erie about trying it</li>
            <li> Also little pieces of the mitt rub off as you use the product.  </li>
            <li> but not sure yet if i would buy again because of some of the other reviews and youtube posts.</li>
            <li> To get an even coverage, I put some Vaseline on my knees, ankles, a little bit of my hands and feet and my elbows.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my face, but I just use the leftover on the mit from doing my body and dab it on my face for a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> I put a little coconut oil on my hair line, eye brows, knees, feet, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> Little pieces of the mit came off while i was applying it</li>
            <li> Remember it gets a bit darker after a little time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried trimming the tube and it helps a little but doesn&#x27;t stop the problem all together.</li>
            <li> I pour a little color on the mitt and spread it around evenly.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of a difference in color.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> In addition, after application it does not bleed excessively as I have noticed from other self tanners.  </li>
            <li> My coworkers have told me in the past that I looked orange with other products I had been using.  </li>
            <li> a little bit orange-y, so keep that in mind when applying.</li>
            <li> Needed a little color for a wedding.  </li>
            <li> It is a little tricky though.  </li>
            <li> A little dish soap or shampoo works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It starts to fall apart leaving little pieces all over your body when u rub it in.</li>
            <li> I put a little lotion on knees, elbows, ankles, wrists.  </li>
            <li> The color gets a little splotchy when it is fading</li>
            <li> Does leak a little when using, even with trimming the plastic tube inside.</li>
            <li> Once, I did get a little on shirt</li>
            <li> No self-tanning nightmares, and it costs less than half a spray tan!</li>
            <li> Anyways, just wanted to give this little update.</li>
            <li> The spray part of my bottle was a little drippy</li>
            <li> so Ihad to keep wiping up little drips from my floor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to tan up a little before heading out on a beach vacation but the product just comes off in the water and leaves streaks on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used this over a little bit of colour</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look orange anywhere except for a hint on my knuckles which was a little brassy/dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a little bit of color for my bridal shower and rehearsal dinner.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous, but</li>
            <li> The little glove helps you apply evenly all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use sparingly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spray a lot on your body, or a little.</li>
            <li> and I did get a little streaking after that on my foot</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t shave the day of application because from my experience I did get little brown dots where the hair grows out.</li>
            <li> and I  smell a little like self tanner.</li>
            <li> I was feeling a little washed-out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure I want to be applying it every other day.  </li>
            <li> gets me so dark and lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> but i was a little worried about my face because  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and found this.</li>
            <li> Put a little dab of lotion on knees, elbows, hands, and feet before applying.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I did it with nothing but a little lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous</li>
            <li> it can get a little darker then</li>
            <li> I glow in the dark!).</li>
            <li> Just a little inconvenience!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used mineral make-up, so I just darkened that a little</li>
            <li> just use a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many fake tanners before and usually they smell awful and leave me looking orange, not fake bake!</li>
            <li> A little unnatural.</li>
            <li> so you can imagine that I&#x27;m a little self-conscious about living in San Diego without a hint of the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> I have to have a little help with those.</li>
            <li> a little is all you need on your face</li>
            <li> btw i am naturally a little tan.</li>
            <li> The mitt  makes it almost fool proof to apply and the spray has a little tint so you can see where it has already been applied.  </li>
            <li> When I received my package the box was a little damaged, no product was leaked though.</li>
            <li> I like to rub a little lotion on knee, ankle and feet areas before applying it.  </li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s little knot like little balls on it.</li>
            <li> It came with the little mit, which you are supposed to spray the tanner on the mit and then start in a circular motion on your body until it is all blended well</li>
            <li> an noticed that a little bit of the guide came off</li>
            <li> Sometimes i even just put a little on my face and neck to liven up my color and bit</li>
            <li> I can put on as much or as little</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll lose a little bit of the tan but trust me..</li>
            <li> I have had moles removed in the past pre-cancerous and really am not at an age (46) to be basking in the sun all the time, since it will also cause wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> and I bought this to go a little cheaper (</li>
            <li> it can be a little abrasive</li>
            <li> Does smell a little after it sets on your skin, but what self tanner doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> rub it in in circular motion and if you have abs you can do little tricks to highlight them a little bit which i do from time to time.</li>
            <li> The color guide is a little orangey</li>
            <li> Just a little tan glow</li>
            <li> After I finished, I put a little lotion on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It is a pain to apply--unlike the self-tanning lotions, this is just dye, which you have to wear gloves and a little mitt to apply.  </li>
            <li> Takes several showers for it to fade and it fades slowly I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I was at a point in my life where I no longer wanted to tan in beds and spray tanning was too expensive (and didn&#x27;t last very long).</li>
            <li> However, the process of getting sprayed, and having to dry afterwards, and having to be super cautious not to sweat or rub on anything is just exhausting (and expensive!), not to mention having to maintain it</li>
            <li> if you miss a tiny patch of skin and just need that one part sprayed, it is very hard to get an even tone.</li>
            <li> but when I applied as usual there is a very pink undertone..</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, you have to keep re-applying it.</li>
            <li> bought this mostly due to it saying no smell and when I first applied it I was shocked no smell none</li>
            <li> It does get a little uneven on the insides of my forearm, elbow crease, etc, but a little touch up swipe  </li>
            <li> By the way I&#x27;m ridiculously white, Irish girl here, my skin is very pale, you will not look like an oompa loompa using fake bake.</li>
            <li> but if it takes that much direction, Id rather just pay way less and get non-spray fake bake, I&#x27;m a total believer in fake bake, just not the spray unit.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t that bad, plus it&#x27;s my fault for not exfoliating first!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the mitt so it is a little messy</li>
            <li> so it could process during sleeping hours as it does get a little of that smell after a few hours of wearing it</li>
            <li> mitt does get a little pilly after a few uses, but it still works.</li>
            <li> A little messy to apply</li>
            <li> Went on a little green looking</li>
            <li> I bought some exfoliating body scrub from Ulta and used that in the shower, then towel dried off and put a little cocoa butter lotion all over my body</li>
            <li> However, it was a little messy to apply, so I thought the spray version might be an easier application.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It fades a little unevenly</li>
            <li> LITTLE AT A TIME TO AVOID WASTE, I SPRAY 1-2 SPRAYS AND</li>
            <li> I applied it a little uneven</li>
            <li> Tough to keep my face and hands as tan because I wash my face and hands daily.</li>
            <li> mitt tough to apply on facial features</li>
            <li> It will not let you down!</li>
            <li> But after about one use, you get it down!  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t give a very dark tan.</li>
            <li> It is very dark, though.</li>
            <li> The solution is very dark when you put it on, so you can see what areas you have already done.</li>
            <li> It is very dark</li>
            <li> VERY DARK.</li>
            <li> It burned my legs and my hair follicles were very dark when I used this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for something very dark, but couldn&#x27;t even obtain a medium tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you build this up it can get very dark</li>
            <li> However, it still wasn&#x27;t very dark.</li>
            <li> ONLY problem, was that the mitt got hard/streaky after a few uses (looked like I was applying a faux Mahogany wood finish onto my thighs!!!).</li>
            <li> I just wish the glove would last a little longer then it has, as it tends to leave fuzzies behind even after it&#x27;s been washed.</li>
            <li> just a little hint if you do get a spot that is too dark, use a small amount of wintergreen alcohol on a cotton pad and apply and blend until you fix it.  </li>
            <li> The color guide solution in the product that helps you apply it washes off, and little color is left behind.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as it is hard to spray on yourself without overspray.  </li>
            <li> I found it a bit hard to use the mit with the gloves on, just cause it kept slipping, but it still blended.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy (I would also recommend cutting the spray tube a little and washing the mitt after every use) but the major drawback of this prodcut for me is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very dark after it dried.</li>
            <li> I consider my skin a meduim tone that gets a little on the pale side in the winter.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it smells amazing instead of that nasty self tanning smell!</li>
            <li> Professional spray tanning wasn&#x27;t an option for everyday as it was way to expensive and</li>
            <li> Which, if you&#x27;re a spray tanner you know how much spray tan usually stinks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big; it&#x27;s awkward to use, and it is constantly sliding off my hand.</li>
            <li> and then you can spray hands and fett at very end to avoid them looking dirty.</li>
            <li> Smells ok going on, still stinks like fake tanner (they all do no matter what people say,</li>
            <li> Goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t look really artificial.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s only two things i don&#x27;t like about it , one - is that the glove they give you to apply it with gets wicked grimey after one use , &amp; even after washing it out , it had like a weird rough texture .</li>
            <li> I used it very sparingly since I was afraid I&#x27;d goof it up.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake sunless tanning system is a must for streakless and natural tanning results.  </li>
            <li> BUT THIS AGAIN HUDGE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner I would suggest watching a few you tube videos on how to apply it.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use tanning beds and the sun is just too harsh.</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Just use it a few nights in a row to get the color that you want.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t messy at all to apply, though I did stand in the shower just in case.</li>
            <li> The mitt did leave a few fuzz balls but nothing that wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> /fade unevenly, which also made me look like i had a skin disease.</li>
            <li> You need to apply a few coats, leave on overnight, and shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> (otherwise you&#x27;ll destroy the mitt and have it&#x27;s lint all over your body).</li>
            <li> I wears off if you dont do it every few days just to maintain the color (which I didnt do) but you shouldn&#x27;t do it every day I think it said every 3-4 days?</li>
            <li> but i still got a few applicatons.</li>
            <li> After about 4 or 5 applications my mitt was getting cakey with dried tanning material</li>
            <li> Lasts for a few days and you can reapply as needed.  </li>
            <li> I like the color it gives you, but it seems to wash off, so you have to put it on everyday....</li>
            <li> I went to use it again yesterday, and the product had turned green.</li>
            <li> One thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this self tanner was some parts of my body were unevenly tanned</li>
            <li> I read online that it was just part of the color left behind on the mitt as it dried/aired out</li>
            <li> all the old fake bake off, until , without a doubt, there was not one stream of the time before application.</li>
            <li> Just a natural looking California-tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also recommend &#x60;Fake Bake Face&#x27; as a companion product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it everyday for almost two years now and have tried just about every product there is.</li>
            <li> My fav so far is St Tropez, but it can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Really messy though.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after a few weeks, it started to have a &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> It lasts about four to five days on me before I would need to do it again, but I use a loofah everyday.</li>
            <li> It does come off unevenly</li>
            <li> My advice...don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Way too much trouble to apply.</li>
            <li> Did NOT AT ALL go on like the one I had used just last week.. not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I picked it up and noticed a green tint all over the mitt.</li>
            <li> The mitt that is included is soft and makes this fake bake fool proof.</li>
            <li> To develop color it does take a few applications -</li>
            <li> I did it three nights in a row and the color stayed for a few days.</li>
            <li> So I tried this Fake Bake and WOW.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it transferring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for a few years now.</li>
            <li> and I used almond oil and a heavy moisturizer on my knees feet and ankles</li>
            <li> A waste of $20</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have to put it on everyday</li>
            <li> Well..there are a few girls in my office who have asked me where my complexion comes from ( thinking it was heritage)</li>
            <li> Applied streaky, bottle leaks and sprays uneven.</li>
            <li> and it was not available at the time.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on this.</li>
            <li> One session of it worked and lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll find out later or tomorrow morning if it has made me blotchy or broken me out</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if tanner was distributed unevenly or if it was just fuzz</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.</li>
            <li> so I practiced a few times leading up to the wedding.  </li>
            <li> Had to put it on a few times to get color</li>
            <li> I did put a small amount of moisturizer on my ankles &amp; knees so they wouldn&#x27;t get too dark.  </li>
            <li> think I was sent a product that was missing the spray.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> And the thing that I&#x27;ve hated most about sunless tanners--the smell--is virtually non-existent with this product.</li>
            <li> There are a few two-sided colors as well:  </li>
            <li> If you are impatient to get them for the sake of getting started asap with your tan, consider ordering here on Amazon, where you can find quicker shipping times, including a few that qualify for Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> like I did and waste money</li>
            <li> I used a mitt and the application was still uneven.</li>
            <li> There are a few drawbacks though.</li>
            <li> I have a wedding in a few days</li>
            <li> and when I finally took the risk ive been addicted ever since.  </li>
            <li> Hold bottle away from skin and don&#x27;t put on too heavily.</li>
            <li> Lasts a few days with one application.</li>
            <li> The application is also a messy situation...</li>
            <li> Every bit of, except under my arms, came off on my bed sheets over a few days.</li>
            <li> If you get it too heavy you can use a scrubby and sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> I did go swimming a few times while wearing the product</li>
            <li> To avoid this, take a shower at night, a few hours before bed, apply the product, then when you get up in the morning take another shower.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m waiting on that to give it another round.</li>
            <li> I would like to know if you have one foe sentive skin since I do have a few break outs in the bend of the underside knee.</li>
            <li> so your elbows aren&#x27;t uneven.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like that the product is so thin that it occasionally drips.  </li>
            <li> I used it at night for a few nights in a row.  </li>
            <li> I recieved a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray your mit too heavy and rub in circular motions.</li>
            <li> So I was online looking for a self tanner..came across a few &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; products then found this which I&#x27;ve never even heard of but</li>
            <li> it is messy and if I applied it anywhere</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times thinking maybe it will take a few applications to develop on my skin, but I received no results.</li>
            <li> The smell is tolerable and went away after it dried on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it requires frequent reapplication (every two-three days) for me to maintain the desired shade of tan, and the color is almost immediately removed by exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I used that a few time this summer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an orange look to it, lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell.  </li>
            <li> This really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be way too messy.</li>
            <li> I clipped the tube on the sprayer before I started and have had no problems with it being messy.  </li>
            <li> I believe it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Looks fake...followed directions and it was just a messy streaky nightmare</li>
            <li> I prefer Neutrogena micro-mist because it doesn&#x27;t have a messy guide color.  </li>
            <li> * Use a heavy moisturizer (Nivea cream, CeraVe cream, or Cetaphil Cream) on your bum and lady bits</li>
            <li> Apply heavy moisturizer to your hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any permanent staining of fabrics in fact I wipe up the sink and bathroom countertops with a white towel afterwards and toss it in the wash....</li>
            <li> It dries in a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t stain anything.</li>
            <li> , I just happened to notice on a few spots that happened to overlap.  </li>
            <li> Color is natural looking, not orangey or fake.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest L&#x27;Oréal sublime bronze for a drugstore brand or Victorias Secret tanning gel if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> Was surprised to see the sally hansen  &amp;#34;leg makeup&amp;#34; gave me a darker tan, covered flaws, and was way easier to use versus the fake bake.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> give the mitt a few sprays, 4.)</li>
            <li> so I am always skeptical when buying tanning products, but this makes me look so natural and</li>
            <li> The smell is tropical with just a hint of the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; smell appearing a few hours after applying the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time and money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> Few Tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to do a few coats of it.</li>
            <li> Once I got a few coats and a few showers on me...</li>
            <li> After alittle trouble with the shipping, product was on backorder and wasn&#x27;t told.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste money stick to orignal lotion.</li>
            <li> Like a burnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt causes uneven spreading on the body.</li>
            <li> I have applied it a few times because I like a darker tan.  </li>
            <li> it takes  a few applications to get to the level you would like for it to sustain.</li>
            <li> it will wash off in a few days...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use eye makeup, because my green eyes just pop with the tan, the way they do when you get that bronze</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this year round from this point forward.  </li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a few years now, and I always get compliments on my tan.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> The tan seems to be uneven, washes off and stains my clothes.</li>
            <li> It will turn those spots green too.&lt;br /&gt;B)</li>
            <li> The glove does turn green though after a few uses</li>
            <li> No streaking, blotching, or uneven areas to be found.</li>
            <li> Boy have I been missing out.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> and my skin was already a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that if I keep using it eventually a tan will appear I hope I didnt waste my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it everyday for almost two years now and have tried just about every product there is.</li>
            <li> anyway, even a tanning salon couldn&#x27;t get me tan in just a few days.</li>
            <li> A few reviews reported an orange color.</li>
            <li> No streaking or fading uneven.</li>
            <li> With that being said, there are a few things I don&#x27;t like about the product.  </li>
            <li> Goes on even and stays for a few days.</li>
            <li> I usually do an all over dark on Friday evening</li>
            <li> It IS messy.  </li>
            <li> But with fake bake, I look like I have a natural glowing tan.</li>
            <li> I guess you have to put on a few coats.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of note, after a few hours the tropical scent wears off and turns into what I call a \\&quot;cornflake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this a few times now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The application is messy.</li>
            <li> Because the product is like spraying water, it is messy.  </li>
            <li> It will give you a nice tan, but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product year round, no doubt.</li>
            <li> Year round tan with this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for all year round bronze, you may wanna try elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover evenly and there was a green hue to it...</li>
            <li> so I still get some uneven color.  </li>
            <li> It also fades uneven on me</li>
            <li> After a few showers and without reapplying its gone.</li>
            <li> Never found one that looks natural before Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Lotion and antiperspirant will turn the product green on your skin.</li>
            <li> Lasts a few days and with this price I can have tons of tans instead of paying 25$ for a spray tan that lasts 3 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and it still has a lot in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes</li>
            <li> so it will rub skin off as you apply to color, which leads to it being uneven.</li>
            <li> It lasts a few days and fades evenly.</li>
            <li> there are a few cons which arent serious&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been applying it twice a week for a few weeks and towards the end</li>
            <li> I had droplet marks after it dried.</li>
            <li> And i get compliments on my tan everyday.</li>
            <li> otherwise you will be found out immediately as i made that mistake and it comes out totally uneven and almost like a worn out leather</li>
            <li> and I even went so far to buy all of Fake Bake&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I didn’t want to waste it</li>
            <li> Fake Bake delivers a natural tan with a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> for streaking, I used to have trouble with that issue</li>
            <li> I do my spray tanning everyday.</li>
            <li> I used one of the tan balms on my elbows and knees so that I wouldn&#x27;t have uneven patches on those places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With Fake Bake it just looks natural, follow directions about using oil on elbows</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t gotten it in a few years.  </li>
            <li> Need to reapply every few days.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this for everyone and using it year round.</li>
            <li> or you will get an uneven tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always look orange, have streaks, and uneven coloring.</li>
            <li> my 31 yr old daughter used to go to a salon to get a fake spray tan  </li>
            <li> to tolerate tropical fragrance that is light&lt;br /&gt;Tan stayed a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x3D; messy and twists around my hand, even when in the glove</li>
            <li> , Fake Bake looks 100% natural with no spots or streaking.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I use the magic-in-a-spray-bottle, I did a few things to prepare.  </li>
            <li> It gets darker within about 24 hours, and stays on for a few days.  </li>
            <li> After completely drying off I followed the directions and began my fake bake.</li>
            <li> for the missing 5th star.</li>
            <li> u dont get any uneven patches and keep your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the mit that is included though.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of it is wasted in the mitt they included,  And the mitt turns green after a few uses</li>
            <li> and thats why im not a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the mitt</li>
            <li> I was a bit gun-shy, seeing as there were a few reviews moaning and groaning about trouble with the mitt and trouble with leaking from the bottle...</li>
            <li> I mean, how the heck am I supposed to know I rubbed something a tiny incy bit thicker in an area that only someone 10 feet behind me can see!?  </li>
            <li> Not smart, duh.</li>
            <li> I have tried it now for two months on both pale and tan skin and have gotten comments about my orangeness from a few close friends when I sport it during the day.</li>
            <li> I do the usual shower, exfoliate, dry, wait at least an hour after shower</li>
            <li> We are a pale, stout people meant to live in cold, dark places.</li>
            <li> Any flaws will be hidden!</li>
            <li> Xen Tan Blending Balm is almost impossible to find these days, but its first ingredient is petrolatum.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal fan :(</li>
            <li> You have to be to careful around your knees, ankles, elbows because it is worse than other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very little mess.  </li>
            <li> I am so pale and this stuff does wonders.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too pale?</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale can&#x27;t tan at all</li>
            <li> Imagine going into the pool tan and coming out pale skinned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pale and this didn&#x27;t turn me orange in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people that are pale because it does not make you orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale girl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly pale person, and I have gotten a lot of compliments on how tan I look.</li>
            <li> and I was just as pale as before.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale as can be, like when in the sun</li>
            <li> that even though i have an olive complexion the winter getd me reallly pale.</li>
            <li> My legs were so pale</li>
            <li> I would think if you are extremely pale this wouldn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond pale.</li>
            <li> I am naturally extremely pale, and have tried every self-tanner I can get my hands on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale.</li>
            <li> So, I thought that my pale skin needed a boost and even though I&#x27;d used Jergen&#x27;s self-tanner before I read the reviews here and decided to give #1 seller a try.  </li>
            <li> you have translucent pale skin, spider veins,</li>
            <li> It would NOT tan my pale pale daughter.</li>
            <li> I have pale, oily skin</li>
            <li> Even on my extremely pale</li>
            <li> so i just couldnt stop because i didnt want to look pale.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, but several hours after application it smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> So being pale i needed somthing that wouldnt hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> i was so pale</li>
            <li> I have ghost pale skin</li>
            <li> but I was so pale</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my pale face</li>
            <li> I am a pale person and it made me tan in three days.</li>
            <li> youre pale</li>
            <li> I have blotchy pale skin &amp; am always putting on some type of sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> Guess I will no longer try to change my pale.</li>
            <li> Embrace the pale.</li>
            <li> I am pale beyond pale.</li>
            <li> you are also pale and are ashamed, pick this up.</li>
            <li> I am pale pale pale pale and I have tried every fale tanning product under the sun.</li>
            <li> I am pale, almost sickly pale.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a normally pale lady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as pale as they make them</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is pale.</li>
            <li> My only serious complaint is about the applicator thing...</li>
            <li> I do, or at least every other day, but I&#x27;m as pale as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some other negative reviewers, who say this product made them orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i tried other lotion(non spray) and at least that did not wash off the tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> complaint is the bottle - it does leak like other people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> Doesnt make you feel all icky like other self tanners</li>
            <li> The only down side was that a few hours later when I got to bed smelled like any other tanning lotion, which I hate...</li>
            <li> I have had no leaking or problems with the mitt being stiff.</li>
            <li> I read that the mitt gets kinda stiff and gooy, so I&#x27;ve been washing mine out after every 2 applications.  </li>
            <li> When I compared the package they look the same but the box was slightly a different color, the bottle was not the same as Fake Bakes bottle (fake bakes bottle was taller and the edges were rounded), and it smells different from the one from fake bake company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some horrible orange blotchy tans and that was the last thing I wanted for her special day.  </li>
            <li> Very little, if any, color left behind.</li>
            <li> BUT for me thats not too bad considering the first time you apply it it can be VERY dark</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and was reluctant to try, but I haven&#x27;t broken out yet and have used this product at least 10 times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale skinned and usually look like a freak with other products leaving me orange and spotty.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible experiences with self-tanners in the past, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is the spray application is messy.</li>
            <li> No strong smell either</li>
            <li> After you shower though, there is that very slight smell like all the others leave</li>
            <li> last product I&#x27;ve used before I decided to try Fake Bake was Neutrogena&#x27;s  Micro Mist Dark;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to smear it or leave lines and the color does not appear orange as some products do.  </li>
            <li> it has a very slight self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> so my next time I will order the dark version from fake bake</li>
            <li> The smell was no better or worse than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried...but it did seem to take a little longer to notice it as compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> When it fades it does look a little bit funny (to be expected) but nothing outrageous looking, as long as you use it every 2 days or so</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t mess this up!</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mess up the tan on my hands!</li>
            <li> Very little trouble with streaking even though I don&#x27;t exfoliate or use lotion before I apply it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked horrible like I had some disease where I was tan in some spots but super white in others.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve ever streaked using this is when I stupidly forgot I applied it and did something outside and got my legs wet, like washing my car or watering the garden.</li>
            <li> Until you shower, the color guard will give you a real, dark looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is with the applicator glove.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on a few minutes before bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few months</li>
            <li> The texture is VERY liquid and VERY difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> However I have been complimented on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; everyday for the past week.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPLY IN SMALL PATCHES to avoid uneven streaking,</li>
            <li> I also avoid using this on my face, I usually use a gradual tanner like Jergen&#x27;s on my face because this appears blotchy and uneven</li>
            <li> Put some heavy moisturizer or petroleum jelly on a cotton pad and wipe on edges of feet, between toes and fingers, and wrists (to blend color where it will usually get over saturated).</li>
            <li> Overall I would definitely recommend to people looking for a darker natural looking tan without a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> As a frequent Xen-Tan dark lotion user I am converted to Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cheap smell you get with usual tanners or streaky color.  </li>
            <li> If you slow down how often you use it, then it will eventually start to fade-</li>
            <li> Takes me maybe 15 mins to do my whole body, comes with plastic gloves, smell isn&#x27;t bad and you can use it as much or as little as you want without looking orange.  </li>
            <li> However if I get a little water or something on my arm, the color guide washes away and you can totally tell I have a fake tan on.</li>
            <li> Like seriously why is there even any other tanning products out there?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat pale, never used a self tanner in the past and had no difficulty applying this.</li>
            <li> My legs are very very pale, so I was just looking for a little something to help get me some color, so that when I go to the beach</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll just be using it to flat dry my sweaters from now on.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle on my bottle of Fake Bake was faulty (needless to say that was a mess trying to use it the first time)</li>
            <li> so I was afraid to try something new.  </li>
            <li> It does fade after a few showers, but doesn&#x27;t look terrible like most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> When I apply fake tan I would like for it to last a few days</li>
            <li> Sadly they saw the same green tint appear on their legs as well.</li>
            <li> Even though at first smelled like coconut it changed the smell after a few hours :(</li>
            <li> - I am so white and dont like sun tan as I have no time for it and every summer I fear my ugly white  legs .</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle,  still slightly skeptical,  because I have the most difficult  dry skin and even airbrush tans will end up streaking and getting into creases and make me look dirty.</li>
            <li> Plan on spending at least a half hour.  </li>
            <li> Hard to mess it up.</li>
            <li> I have left it on overnight and ran errands in early morning, and the base color does not come off til</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t water proof- don&#x27;t cry with this on your face!!</li>
            <li> So dark!!</li>
            <li> One little drop of water makes the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; disappear - if you run to your car in the rain you will look like a leopard!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale and you hate self-tanning products, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Last week I was looking at myself and thinking I&#x27;m too freakin&#x27; pale, so I decided to peruse Amazon for some Fake Bake</li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t turn out too bad, as I only did small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU FAKE BAKE!!! :)</li>
            <li> but during the winter I do look a little dull.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your face, hands, and feet because it&#x27;s a little hard to get in on evenly in those areas.</li>
            <li> I like the mitt, but this spray version is a little hard to rub in for me.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave a nasty smell after it dries and has a very light coconut smell going on.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, even though I exfoliated and did what the directions said around the knees and elbows, they still got too dark.  </li>
            <li> so I really do not know what to post on here due to my forgetting, sorry.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Fake Bake really because it was much less expensive than the St. Tropez.</li>
            <li> and I believe is the secret to the success of fake tanning!</li>
            <li> , just get a damp cloth and put a large pinch of baking soda on it and rub the bad tan away.  </li>
            <li> It deposits very dark on these areas and hard to rub off.</li>
            <li> at least a little tan were before I&#x27;d taken a shower.</li>
            <li> , I tried using moisturizer before application which worked well, but very little color was retained after 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get a very dark tan!</li>
            <li> very very dark !</li>
            <li> Had very little issues with streaking but that was because I&#x27;m a beginner at this.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, very little smell and haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Also takes very little per application so it will go along way for me.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other brand again!!!</li>
            <li> Money well spent!!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, drying and comes out uneven</li>
            <li> Stains sheets/clothes as usual self-tanners do, but looks surprisingly natural and that weird smell you usually get from self-tanners is extremely subtle in comparison to the others.  </li>
            <li> It dries out my skin really bad and fades way too fast.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fast and also will get on surface you are standing and stain your.feet bad</li>
            <li> It looks really patchy and bad if you let it get to that point.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt smell bad either.it doesnt streak which i really like because i use it on my legs all the time.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li> When I have used self tanners before I usually turn out looking like a caution cone.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t want it to look like she obviously used a fake tanner.  </li>
            <li> No more money on spray tans.</li>
            <li> THE SOLUTION TURNED GREEN!</li>
            <li> I noticed a weird spot on my back and found out it was basal cell carcinoma.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this two days in a row</li>
            <li> I usually use the non-spray, and use the gloves and rub it on...</li>
            <li> The elbows and hands are difficult areas to apply tanners and this product is no different...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy tanner.</li>
            <li> I usually use St. Tropez self tanner, it&#x27;s a bit pricy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the actual Fake Bake mitt with this kit.</li>
            <li> and I usually burn instead of tan in the sun.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake applied with a Q Tip has been then only thing that has worked.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the smell offensive, but a vague coconut-y if chemical scent remains that lasts into the second day.</li>
            <li> no orange color, I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product I had bought at Ulta.</li>
            <li> If you are used to getting spray tans, I&#x27;m not sure this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered my second Fake Bake kit.</li>
            <li> so you might want to cut a small section of it off before using</li>
            <li> Spray and then use a small cosmetic sponge (ones used for foundation) and blend in.  </li>
            <li> I usually do two mists in a circle like motion on face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I didn&#x27;t exfoliate sufficiently or if that is just how the product works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of tanners and even the ones touting their formulas don&#x27;t smell usually smell.  </li>
            <li> I was so hesitant and skeptical that it took me two months of starring at the box to actually give it a try.</li>
            <li> Well, after being persuaded by several friends, I decided to purchase this Fake Bake product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I usually keep it on for 12 hours before I shower.</li>
            <li> The guide color is darker than the actual fake tan after development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li> I took a dip in the water at a pool party and it washed all my tanner off :/.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used Fake Bake before</li>
            <li> Thank you Fake Bake for this product and I will definitely be stocking up on these!</li>
            <li> Also, once I woke up, my skin did not hurt like it usually does</li>
            <li> so no more tanning beds for me.</li>
            <li> I did have an issue with it staining my sheets, not sure if it will come off in the wash or not because i just noticed that my sheets are covered in spray tan.</li>
            <li> By morning it smells like fake tanner but that smell goes away instantly after you</li>
            <li> It will usually stay on my skin for about 4-5 days maybe a week depending on if I exfoliated beforehand.</li>
            <li> , I always end up in uneven patches and streaks!</li>
            <li> I was meticulous and worked in small sections, from the bottom up.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to a few friends and they have done well with it as well!</li>
            <li> Now I can have a tan year round and not worry about damaging UV Rays!</li>
            <li> , it seems that it dries my skin (though I am not sure if it is the product itself or the requirement to forego your moisturizer the night you apply the tan).</li>
            <li> the box you&#x27;ll find the lotion, pump, two latex gloves, and a small mitt.  </li>
            <li> I usually use tan wipes or go into the salon for a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I got a product that works or what happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so I then tried to use a small zip-lock type baggie under the mitt.</li>
            <li> I am not able to go to the tanning bed as I probably would have before.</li>
            <li> Fake bake has definitely helped me with my confidence after giving birth also.</li>
            <li> I recently tried using a L&#x27;Oreal tinted fake tan gel</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, and not sure I will.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried st tropez, st moritz, au courant,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I decided to try it this last May</li>
            <li> However, I guess I am not sure which side you spray on the mitt.  </li>
            <li> I usually spend $30 to get a spray tan but no more.</li>
            <li> But I apply a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> I usually do this about 3x a week to be as tan as I want to be for an event.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spraying the tan onto the mit in a sink or some small area that will catch the mist that misses the glove.  </li>
            <li> I usually put on two nights in a row to get the color that I want and then it lasts for a week.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER the last bottle I&#x27;ve ordered has started to make me itch like crazy, especially on the inside of my arms and behind my knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or my skin did, but it looks like I am going to have to switch products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the creams, lotions, and sprays all left me orange or blotchy/uneven.  </li>
            <li> I have the usual self tanner hands</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re spraying and applying do so over a non-porous surface because it will spray past the mitt and get on the surrounding area.</li>
            <li> The tan is never orange; it usually takes me 2 applications to get my desired tan.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the product or me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll use some of the face lotion on a small spot (like where you watch wore off the color</li>
            <li> I wish I had never ever ever wasted my time on another self tanner!</li>
            <li> Usually use air brush tanning.</li>
            <li> I also have this same problem with the Fake Bake lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the regular fake bake that&#x27;s not the 60 min one</li>
            <li> No more patchy orangy skin.</li>
            <li> , I usually wait about 3 minutes then after application to get dressed&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Has not worked so well on stomach and chest, which are usually darkest areas of my body this time of year..</li>
            <li> I usually put it on in the afternoon when I get home from work and wear it until bedtime.  </li>
            <li> Usually lasts 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Big fan of this Fake Bake Product.  </li>
            <li> No more sun for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rub it in and do small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> It does small amounts of glow/tan over time so don&#x27;t expect a drastic change</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of self tanners over the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> not cute</li>
            <li> (Half a spray tan would be ridiculous, anyhow).</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t need Blending Balm on my knees when I use body butter.</li>
            <li> Usually even if you don&#x27;t smell it that night, you will by morning.</li>
            <li> I tried Fake Bake after trying numerous self tanners for years!</li>
            <li> I usually use this in the tub or shower and spray the mitt 8-10 times per application.  </li>
            <li> You can not be lazy with this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish I wasn&#x27;t as lazy</li>
            <li> It helps even out the color disparity between my arms and legs that comes from my usual outfit of jeans and tank tops.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t build up around my ankles, knees and elbows like the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this same Fake Bake four times now.  </li>
            <li> When applying it  I usually spray it on my skin THEN rub.</li>
            <li> I can layer it on if I want to, or just put a small amount on to give me a brown glow.</li>
            <li> You have to marinate in it over night, and the small is god awful, and most of it washed off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I get a bit lazy sometimes when using a self tanning lotions,  but there is no skipping those steps here.</li>
            <li> switched back to the Fake Bake lotion following this product, and I prefer that Fake Bake to this one.</li>
            <li> I usually apply at night after taking a shower and shaving/exfoliating well.</li>
            <li> Over the past 15 years I have bought almost every drugstore self-tan lotion out there.  </li>
            <li> I can get a faint whiff several hours after application</li>
            <li> No more gradual lotions for me</li>
            <li> : Test a small area</li>
            <li> : For face application I suggest using a small talfa pad, Spray a wee bit on the pad and blot on face, followed by a circular motion to even it out.</li>
            <li> but I felt it was necessary for Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake gave me a tan in three days that would of taken me one/two weeks using the tanning bed, Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> but after a time I began to get a small amount of itching where it was applied.  </li>
            <li> And herein lies the rub – no pun intended: for anyone who&#x27;s body is not perfectly made for this product (i.e. if you have anything but A-cup boobs and tiny thighs)</li>
            <li> I also cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with sunless tanner streaking or looking muddy in those areas.</li>
            <li> Its a holy grail product year round!</li>
            <li> Only to have that orange fake tone.  </li>
            <li> I received fake bake before I left for the beach.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do about that...</li>
            <li> (not sure if I spelled that correctly) flooring.  </li>
            <li> A small drop fell onto mine and the floor bleached a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray color went on the mitt but also everywhere else on the walls and floors of my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Do as the instructions recommend and apply another layer each day if you are not satisfied with the color.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous fake tans over the years and the aerosol spray I used to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a ton of sun damage that I&#x27;ve been trying to reverse for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I do like Tan Towels and the Neutrogena spray, however I still was not completely satisfied about the color.</li>
            <li> I usually apply twice a week to keep color</li>
            <li> do use this on my face, but Fake Bake makes a self tanner specifically for face, and I want to try this next.</li>
            <li> However, it is a small sacrifice if you want a tan without the risk of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend usually complains when I use self tanner because of the DHA smell</li>
            <li> I usually use St Tropez&#x27;s spray or mousse but saw this and thought for the price, why not try it.</li>
            <li> I used Fake Bake again last night and within 3 hours, I was itchy and my skin felt flushed on the areas I applied to.</li>
            <li> Dead on fix!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t go overboard on face.</li>
            <li> I feel the mit is a waste and sucks up a lot of product.</li>
            <li> but I feel like you don&#x27;t get that obvious fake tan smell with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanner for the past 11 years.</li>
            <li> The price for this product is unbelievable as well, so I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Downside to this is that it comes off all over your pillow and sheets.. not sure what to do about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took the advice from another user on here about cutting the tube before use and it&#x27;s not leaked at all for me so far.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake however, is the only self-tanner I can wear during the day and apply whenever I want without fear of giving off that funky self-tanner odor.</li>
            <li> This look is not cute.</li>
            <li> Tried fake bake last night showered used a exfoliating scrubber .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply lotion to your joints, where dryness usually occurs, to prevent color buildup&lt;br /&gt;Consider buying an additional mit</li>
            <li> In the past if I&#x27;ve used spray cans, lotions and foams.  </li>
            <li> I usually rub some olive oil or vaseline on my hands and wipe em just in case it gets on my palms but never had any</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> I was concerned I&#x27;d look orange or well, fake, because I&#x27;m so white.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item I also ordered the same product from the Fake Bake company.</li>
            <li> I understand the attempt to avoid the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; hue, but GREEN?!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Fake Bake has definitely raised the bar!  </li>
            <li> apply small amounts at a time 1-2-3 puffs, so you can control the amount and color</li>
            <li> The mitt is too small and falls off your hand.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have been using every type of sunless tanner for the past year.</li>
            <li> No trace of that usual self tanner odor.</li>
            <li> it had turned GREEN!</li>
            <li> When i tried it on me it turned me green!</li>
            <li> This is my second year using Fake Bake...</li>
            <li> Spray small amounts of tanner in the glove and swipe in</li>
            <li> There is no better sunless tanning system.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> last time i put Fake Bake on</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t return this item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order my fourth bottle of Fake Bake tanning spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where people are getting those results</li>
            <li> Prior to using the fake bake tanner, I have been using the jergens tanning lotion for about 4 years.</li>
            <li> Still not sure of the results</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant because ive tried &amp; failed with tons of drugstore brands, expensive home airbrush, mousse, lotions &amp; towelettes,</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t blind people with my white legs.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was supposed to come with two</li>
            <li> and I usually burn in the sun.</li>
            <li> No more sun for me</li>
            <li> I usually wear pajamas over it</li>
            <li> ONLY FAKE TAN IVE USED AND WILL -PLAN</li>
            <li> I do put a small amount on my face.i</li>
            <li> But I also use daily tented moisturizer &amp; Fake Bake helps to give that a boost and make you darker OVER TIME.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d even fault the product for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product, usually 2 or3 days in a row to build the tan.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t vouch for how this would work for people who are very pale who do not also sun bathe at least a little.</li>
            <li> i am not a very experienced self-tanner user and some products are a disaster waiting to happen with streaks and uneven coloring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ridiculous splattering mess.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely pale, and have history of skin cancer in my family, so I try not to use tanning beds or go out in the sun without at least an SPF 50.</li>
            <li> Much safer than the bed, less annoying than the spray tan at the salon (and cheaper).</li>
            <li> I was seriously concerned that my skin might feel so tight by the time morning</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t hate me too much right?</li>
            <li> I am typically very pale and left with sun damage so unfortunately, I had to give up the tanning booths and sun bathing...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and think its very messy to apply</li>
            <li> It is very messy in terms of when spraying it on your body alot of product lands up on the floor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply it very heavy</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very messy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very pale and freckle easily, so if I&#x27;m not sure that this is the product for you if you&#x27;re looking for a Brazilian bronze glow.</li>
            <li> Pale girls can look tan too!</li>
            <li> Embrace the pale!</li>
            <li> I started looking for self tanners because I just can&#x27;t handle being pale!</li>
            <li> just so you know that I&#x27;m not joking about being pale!)</li>
            <li> This is coming from a Pale girl, no lie!</li>
            <li> Service\\&quot;    This clearly says to me that these products could be fake!</li>
            <li> if you were to pay close attention to them it looks like I have little tiny brown dots on them, almost like they&#x27;re dirty.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake provides the gloves as a protective barrier because they recommend spraying directly onto the mitt to apply (I used this technique), but I found the gloves to be unnecessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike tanning lotions, the mess with Fake Bake is minimal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 2x a week for a solid base.</li>
            <li> For me, this was not very good at all.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you use conventional UV tanning, I guarantee you&#x27;ll care when you get tumors/cancer and your skin will seriously age by 30.</li>
            <li> I burn, peel and turn white again :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked the tanning lotions because they left me orange and streaky, but no more!  </li>
            <li> I am very pale skinned.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, you can see the veins through my skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been very pale when I&#x27;m used to being tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very pale skin, and for me....</li>
            <li> However I am very pale</li>
            <li> very pale</li>
            <li> However I will say that I am naturally very very pale and:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very pale.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t tan and am very pale.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and never tan, always burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and</li>
            <li> But, I could no longer take being so very pale.</li>
            <li> i am very pale and have frreckles.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this does not turn my skin orange.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and I like that with one application</li>
            <li> but I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am very very pale, from Washington, and don&#x27;t see a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have VERY pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am naturally a very pale person.</li>
            <li> very pale, do not tan.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have very pale, and somewhat freckly skin.</li>
            <li> No orange streaky mess!!</li>
            <li> again.. gotta be the color guard, the streaks will go away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hop in the shower and have my normal shower, and that gym sock smell was just BAD</li>
            <li> Sorry this is so long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with Fake Bake for the long term.  </li>
            <li> Since traditional forms of tanning are out of the question and really very bad for your skin, I&#x27;ve tried a few different tanning products-</li>
            <li> I am a very pale natural redhead and I have had the problem of getting no color or very little from self tanning products before, but not this bad and some do work.</li>
            <li> I remembered in high school the awful sunless tanners that I tried that left me looking like a walking orange.</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold place year round, so</li>
            <li> of the color washes off as soon as you shower which is a big negative, maybe this is why it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other self tanners???</li>
            <li> It clogs your pores to where it looks like you&#x27;ve broken out in black heads everywhere.</li>
            <li> So needless to say, It came on to heavy, so too dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an awful smell, just too strong.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the fake bake products as I have been a long time fan since I found they gave me the least orange look.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, makes my skin feel so soft and no streaks!</li>
            <li> This helped me get ready for summer and did not look fake, despite the name on the package!!</li>
            <li> Left nasty streaks on my skin and looked so blotchy and un natural!</li>
            <li> the mitt started to not do as well of a job applying:/that may have been my fault for rubbing in too hard.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a sunless tanner that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it solely on the mitt.</li>
            <li> but I had a hard time keeping the mitt on with a baggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you push too hard you will just wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> This product hardly has any smell to it either-</li>
            <li> Just done scrub too hard in the shower and one application will stay for 7+ days.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to apply evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to spray out of and I will need to get another one soon.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to put on with out using additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even in those hard to color areas like knees, ankles, elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve shaved and don&#x27;t press too hard, your mitt should NOT be leaving fuzzes on you.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this again because is hard for me to do.</li>
            <li> It is so hard for me to get a tan.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I spray onto the mitt and rub into those hard to spray spots.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find this type of product that doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint, but this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> Faulty mitt, hard to apply on backsomething that they would worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, although I have a hard time getting an even coat around my neck/collarbone area.</li>
            <li> rub too hard.</li>
            <li> And the mitt makes it hard to apply evenly to your face, but i manage.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t rub the mitt on myself too hard.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and everytime I try a self tamner it hardly works, but I bought this and received it today</li>
            <li> Hard to apply</li>
            <li> It was hard to apply to places like collarbone, knees, ankles, and</li>
            <li> a cream sunless tanner is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> maybe i rub too hard?</li>
            <li> AND I HARDLY HAD TO USE ANY</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get an even tan.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glow in the dark!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell like some of the other self tanning products out there.  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin and have a very hard time tanning instead of burning.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing was the Mitt tends to flake off a little bit when rubbing the product on.</li>
            <li> Upon using this a few times and assuming I was doing it wrong, I called the company and had the misfortune I&#x27;ve been speaking to an irreverent, unapologetic little snot who verified that sweat, lotion, and skin-on-skin contact would, indeed, cause this product not to work and sheoffered no tips, tricks, or hints that might help me, otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pale, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works the same for someone with with a base tan, than someone without !</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s natural looking and doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one negative to this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to apply it on at least two or three times a week  before I get the shade I want.</li>
            <li> Several times even the smallest droplet of water from the faucet would hit my skin, leaving a weird spot.&lt;br /&gt;-it fades poorly.</li>
            <li> It also has the least amount of fragrance of those I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The only tanning product I have found that looks natural, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and fades evenly.</li>
            <li> I also found it was not buildable in the least</li>
            <li> and now I look like I have tanned for at least a month</li>
            <li> it sucks...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been at least five years.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> well at least the smell of it any way.</li>
            <li> I do not tan, not in the least.</li>
            <li> That being said, I would ALWAYS wait at least an hour before going to bed to avoid the color rubbing off on my elbows/knees</li>
            <li> the better..at least 6-8 hrs).</li>
            <li> At least $10 cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> /&gt;In response to basically every negative review</li>
            <li> A delicate touch with do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> that, it stinks later that day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not orange in the least.</li>
            <li> All the sunless tanning product i used - after applying to the skin , i have to wait at least 30 min till it dries on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have baked in the sun, roasted in tanning beds,and slathered on at least fifty self-tanners during that time period.  </li>
            <li> This one has the least scent I have ever come across in a tanner formula.  </li>
            <li> , I exfoliate like crazy, especially my face.  </li>
            <li> Filling pores on my upper so that it appeared dirty.</li>
            <li> I took a shower late that night after working in the yard and saw &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; in the water as I showered.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes (at least it hasn&#x27;t yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OR AT LEAST 12 HOURS)</li>
            <li> Another complaint that others have commented</li>
            <li> it stay on your skin at least 12 hours before sweating or washing it off.  </li>
            <li> but I waited a extra 15 minutes plucking my eyebrows and cutting my nails</li>
            <li> This is also a common complaint with self tanners.  </li>
            <li> I never considered myself a tanning bed &#x27;worshipper&#x27;, but did get in it at least once a week every spring and summer.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> and always the same disappointing results.</li>
            <li> IT dries in about 15-20 minutes, and lasts at least 3</li>
            <li> up anything,and even if staining would happen- you don&#x60;t feel sorry,and everything washable( so instead of vining, be prepared);&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x60;t shower for at least 5-6 hours after applying FB;&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x60;t</li>
            <li> i use shea suger body stuff in lime as it has the least odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to stay, I have to be careful with fake tanners.</li>
            <li> allow at least two showers to wash off the excess product.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this...</li>
            <li> let it sit for at LEAST 6 hours, and use your hands to rinse, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts at least a month, if not two, by using it twice per week.</li>
            <li> My husband had made the rude comment of \\&quot;You should tan</li>
            <li> The color lasts about 5 days, slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> I am used to thick lotions or gels.</li>
            <li> it slow with your face, don&#x27;t continuously re-spray your face after it has been sprayed before.  </li>
            <li> (I cant emphasize how much so), and I HATE the yo-yo skin color effect from burning, tanning and fading you get from infrequent use.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of them which is why I rarely used them.</li>
            <li> Use a thick body butter on your ankles, wrists, elbows, knees-</li>
            <li> Other then that, Amaze-balls!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very attractive.  </li>
            <li> It stil has an odor to it but not half as bad as the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> ALSO if you are REALLY worried, just buy some fake tan remover along with the fake tan!</li>
            <li> I have very small hands, so I can&#x27;t imagine how inconvenient it must be for someone with larger hands.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every tan-in-a-bottle as well, from the gradual tanning lotions in every brand, to the $45 St. Tro-you-know-what, and there was always at least one major flaw, whether it be difficult application, unnatural coloring, stinky scent, or expensive</li>
            <li> No more sprays or foams for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve always has streaks with all the other brands I&#x27;ve used, but not with this fake bake</li>
            <li> looking forward to trying other  Fake Bake products.</li>
            <li> I had also been using it with other tanning products, so if I had used it alone, it would have out-lasted the Fake Bake spray.</li>
            <li> Like any other fake tan, it DOES have that smell</li>
            <li> Finally, no more ghost legs all summer!</li>
            <li> Not magic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every other fake bake product, the airbrush, mousse, gel, body butter.</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Well no more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how in the world they did it, but this stuff does not have that offensive fake tanner smell that every other product I&#x27;ve tried has had.</li>
            <li> I can put on and actually go out in public without looking crazy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanners and compared to Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I usually ended up being embarrassed to leave the house!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Fake Bake products, and this one works as well as all of them.</li>
            <li> The only fake tanner I use!</li>
            <li> Big fan of Fake Bake!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my ultimate go to for fake tan!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d venture onto Fake Bake&#x27;s other tanning solutions.</li>
            <li> I just use it with my other fake tan.</li>
            <li> No more streaks!  </li>
            <li> No more tanning salons!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever have to go back to fake baking again!</li>
            <li> No more orange hands!  </li>
            <li> I know because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other fake tanners.  </li>
            <li> but after 3 uses, the liquid (yes, liquid NOT lotion) turned green!!</li>
            <li> GREEN!!</li>
            <li> I also use the mitt with the other fake bake tanners as well.</li>
            <li> You will know what we mean when you see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unbelievable people thought i just got a lot of sun and didn&#x27;t look orange at all!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get insecure about it, so I&#x27;ve tried a couple other tanning methods.</li>
            <li> no more of that!</li>
            <li> and I mean goof proof.  </li>
            <li> The only negative, if you get wet; like if you get caught in the rain, or are taking the cover off the pool, it can streak.  GRRR!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every self tanner from drugstore to  really high dollar stuff, I&#x27;ve even done spray tans from the tanning salon, They all have looked like crap on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad on blemishes and scars in general, so be warmed if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this to cover up any imperfections, because I&#x27;ve found it enhances them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as dark as the fake bake darker version.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the store was out of the Fake Bake dark lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, since Alcohol SD is the second ingredient, and it advises against any lotion.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I have not noted any weird hyper dark discolorations.</li>
            <li> I was hooked on the very expensive Guerlain Terracotta Self Tan Spray that you could only get out of the U.S.  </li>
            <li> Not much better or worse than drug store self-tanners for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried cutting the tube that goes into the applicator, shorter, as it was to long, but this did not help.  </li>
            <li> people are surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s an artificial tan!</li>
            <li> Sadly I ended up washing it down the drain.</li>
            <li> It does not make me feel selfconcious all day about smelling weird like the other products have!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to accept the white skin tone</li>
            <li> i have a serious skin condition.</li>
            <li> It is noticeable, but subtle.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say the product was slightly torn and leaked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I finally came to my senses and realized how horrible it is not only for your health but for your skin.</li>
            <li> but it has almost evened out this ridiculous sunburn</li>
            <li> I seriously am head over heals for this product.</li>
            <li> This self tanner - seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously yall, WASH YOUR MITTEN.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but we wanted a subtle color for pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only time I ever regret applying it is when I get drunk and decide to fake tan.</li>
            <li> And this is my FIRST TIME USING FAKE TANNER, I was always afraid of looking like an Oompa Loompa!  </li>
            <li> I admit that I have a serious tanning addiction and since I am trying to stop years of destruction done to my face &amp; body from tanning beds &amp; beach days, a friend suggested I try this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the only fake tanner that doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive, too.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent and immediately gave me the tan</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not exfoliating once and had weird blotchy spots from where the tanner applied previously was still on me.</li>
            <li> but i like to for subtle.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot stop staring at them</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to Clarins body bronzer, but alot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is the only fake tan I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t look orange or fake.</li>
            <li> So, I cut about a half inch off the bottom of the tube then twisted it</li>
            <li> The streaking of it however was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> It smelled horrible and was super exspensive.</li>
            <li> It stinks a little less than other brands but still stinks.</li>
            <li> This is the least streaky fake tanner that I have ever used (and my pale self has used a ton).</li>
            <li> I think Fake Bake needs to fix that mess.</li>
            <li> everyone compliments my natural tan look...but its my secret!!!</li>
            <li> and I am naturally very pale!</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I did not turn Orange or abnormally tan!</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve hated about other brands is the smell and this one has no lasting odor.</li>
            <li> this worked extremely well but made me ill and nauseated and dizzy.</li>
            <li> For anyone afraid to buy this product due to a negative review, please don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> It was a bronze mess!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered this tanner because I had never used one before</li>
            <li> One application give u just a little glow and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> And fake bake has been my go to for a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> Looks a little fake when applied to the face though.</li>
            <li> I read about Fake Bake and thought I&#x27;d try it but had little faith.</li>
            <li> mitt that comes with the Fake Bake started to leave little fuzz on my skin</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m disappointed is a major understatement.</li>
            <li> I was having to apply Fake Bake every night just to get my skin to retain a little color.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying fake bake once a week and then tan icon on Fridays to get a little glow for the weekend.</li>
            <li> When you are putting the product on, it doesn&#x27;t have the fake tan smell, but when I woke up in the morning I could smell it a little.</li>
            <li> because I am already so tan, it makes it a little difficult to see where I am putting it.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to keep the glove on my hand while rubbing in the tanning spray.</li>
            <li> I have fair/light skin and was wary when I received this and sprayed it into the mitt, it looked very dark</li>
            <li> I even did his face neck and ears without using the cream I read about and the only part that was bad were the tops of his feet.</li>
            <li> the only thing i can think of that is bad is that you have to apply it often to keep the tan,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I might buy a third bottle on a whim and see if I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> THIS product is amazing--it doesn&#x27;t smell bad even after a couple of hours or the next morning</li>
            <li> There are no streaks, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it starts tanning instantly!</li>
            <li> started by using it on my legs only, just in case it went badly.</li>
            <li> and this is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t smell bad or make me look orange</li>
            <li> it does have a tiny bit of smell but not that bad.</li>
            <li> and I actually ended up getting really bad acne.</li>
            <li> Indoors, the final color doesn&#x27;t look too too bad -</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and when you take a shower the next morning, the smell washes off.</li>
            <li> Only bad part is, it starts to fad after a couple days.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that you must spray it on a glove and then rub it in.</li>
            <li> I have also tried Sun Labs self-tanner which lasts longer and gets you darker quicker, however, the smell is so bad that I can only put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only self tanner that doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to use the spray without the mitt and was frustrated to see the greenish tint appear once again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, buy the fake bake 6 hour tanner instead.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s too expensive to waste).  </li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> But had leaked and was no good by the time I got it.  </li>
            <li> or they are splotchy and look like I&#x27;ve got dirt all over me, obviously not a good look either way.</li>
            <li> I never once got questioned whether my tan was fake - even in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I am not fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> however i know that it is not good for my skin</li>
            <li> , I am totally addicted, i do have to do it at least 3 times a week for my glow to stay, oh</li>
            <li> I had quite a few friends ask me if I had beens using a tanning bed after just two applications of the fake bake spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is no good.</li>
            <li> Be careful, the bottle does leak like crazy.</li>
            <li> so I am not fair complected at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Fake Bake and the Fake Bake Darker in the grey bottle.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned having issues with the bottle leaking and suggested cutting the straw that goes in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just like when you dye your hair it calls for cold water to rinse never hot ..</li>
            <li> hardly any smell!</li>
            <li> was looking for help darkening  my legs, they are hard to get tan!  </li>
            <li> My arms don&#x27;t look as bad because they are naturally darker, but anywhere else has a weird unnatural color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look overly fake or shocking if I am pale one day and dark the next.</li>
            <li> This product has minimal unpleasant smell after it&#x27;s oxidized...  </li>
            <li> No sticky icky feel after applying!</li>
            <li> The least smelly self tanner!</li>
            <li> As we all know the sun rays are dangerous to our skin with the amount of time we want to spend out in it getting dark.</li>
            <li> The smell at first is like coconut scent instead of that nasty self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mit from Ulta in the past and it&#x27;s a game changer!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to look crazy dark during the winter.  </li>
            <li> I bought the small 6-ounce size of Fake Bake to test it out.  </li>
            <li> I slept in the same bed as my boyfriend about an hour after applying, and we were both afraid that some of the product would rub off onto him throughout the night, but it didnt!</li>
            <li> Overall I am disappointed with the product and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed I wish I coul get my money back!!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake streaked was extremely uneven and looked so unnatural!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m obsessed with spray tans since I have tattoos and don&#x27;t want to ruin them by regular tanning, but it&#x27;s so annoying when I have to waste time out of my day just to go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> , so I was desperate to find a self tanning lotion that wasn&#x27;t gonna hurt the baby, but also made me dark.  </li>
            <li> I come out looking brown, not orange, and this is the first self tanner EVER that doesn&#x27;t smell disgusting, or sparkle.</li>
            <li> Going back to St. Tropez. :(</li>
            <li> It is not golden, it is not tan, it is dirty brown.</li>
            <li> I am afraid they will be too dark...</li>
            <li> Despite what one reviewer here said: cutting the spray tip down did NOT reduce the leaking-</li>
            <li> With this product, gone are the days of applying your self-tanner and spending the rest of your evening sticky, afraid to sit down or put clothes on, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, i tried very hard to apply it correctly, but it was so streaky everywhere.</li>
            <li> That is very hard to do.</li>
            <li> I always had horrible experiences with self tanners, so I took a chance at this one reading all the positive reviews, I must say I agree with all of them.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t make me look completely fake as I am a very pale red-head.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale legs, so needless to say they don&#x27;t see the sun too often.</li>
            <li> I am very pale &amp; always burn so fake bake</li>
            <li> I would have given it a five but its a bit awkward to apply evenly w/o making some mess.</li>
            <li> They are also very thick and oily feeling, and remain sticky for quite a while after application.</li>
            <li> box includes latex gloves which I cautiously used in the beginning but found them unnecessary.</li>
            <li> THAT in itself is extremley irritating.</li>
            <li> I think is poor quality and slips off your hand during application.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of using makeup that washed off and got on everything  </li>
            <li> I have become addicted to self tanners and have tried them all including spray tans at the tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mit is TERRIBLE quality in comparison to the very affordable mit at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the consistency is thin and is that of water but the malfunctioning bottle made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the scent of the self tanner I was using</li>
            <li> Also I took others advice and cut the plastic tube and have not experienced any leaking from the spray nozzle or cap.</li>
            <li> After about two hours, however,  that nasty tanning solution smell came and I got REALLY discouraged...</li>
            <li> I came outside and she sat up and said HOLY CRAP</li>
            <li> After 3 days of smelling nothing but that on my skin just made things worse.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, is the vendor continues to ship out defective product.</li>
            <li> It did irritate my veracious veins behind my knee.</li>
            <li> If you ever got a spray tan (I&#x27;ve had a few), you should know what DHA smells like, and it stinks, and that&#x27;s the after smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Started back up again in March laying in the beds, to get all base tanned for summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a musty scent that smells a bit worse than sweat (but not B.O.).</li>
            <li> As I said earlier, I hate guide colors.</li>
            <li> I can actually put it on my hands and feet without it looking like crap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanning products, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m tired of tanning in a bed every day.</li>
            <li> Not happy...</li>
            <li> Also, I was a bit addicted to this tanner and applied it 4 days in a row...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now &amp; have never experienced this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do anymore then a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy with that situation.</li>
            <li> I have used worse</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer of lotion as a barrier before tanning</li>
            <li> It was worse when I got up this morning</li>
            <li> I am extremely tired of being ORANGE.</li>
            <li> I am borderline addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> ive had a lot of problems with tan sprays before because the nozzles are always broken before i even use them or they splat all over the place but not with this product it sprays onto the mitt evenly and</li>
            <li> it didnt make my psoriasis worse.</li>
            <li> So, false advertising, along with non-working sprayer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product since I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners &amp; they were horrible,  however this one is different.  </li>
            <li> little to they know it&#x27;s FAKE BAKE!</li>
            <li> That dreaded fake tan smell, front and center, even worse than the jergens brand!!</li>
            <li> Where were you all my pale life!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who have tried every store brand self tanner and have been disappointed by every single one of them.</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad like every other one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used other tanning products, you would agree that the smell after a tanner is oxidized smells really bad.</li>
            <li> It was not as bad as with other products</li>
            <li> This product also didn&#x27;t leave streaks, I wasn&#x27;t orange, and it didn&#x27;t smell bad like other self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> But seriously, if you&#x27;re thinking about it just try it!</li>
            <li> Seriously its goof proof!</li>
            <li> Also, the warning about it coloring your hands, oh boy take that one seriously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle cause I paid for it, but, overall, not impressed :(</li>
            <li> that was always the worst part for me.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that they turn you a weird orange color, when it peels you look dirty and half crazed.</li>
            <li> What was horrible was 12 hours after applying I showered, as normal, no exfoliation.</li>
            <li> which means no more awkward standing with arms and legs</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too awful, but it does have a hint of the normal self-tanner odor.</li>
            <li> stuff really is stupid proof as long as you read and follow the directions!</li>
            <li> This one does not do that AS BADLY, but it still appears slightly orange.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the application, while slightly time consuming, isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> However, every so often, because of the weird and uneven peeling of the self tanner, I have to wait for a week, scrub it all off like crazy, and start over again.</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying it just looks like you put on a dusting of bronzing powder, not too dramatic or too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> Thw absolute worst fake tan ever streaking and dye smears everwhere!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (Yes I waited at least 20 minutes before dressing back up after I tanned), the worst was on my legs..</li>
            <li> Very subtle.</li>
            <li> It shows up instantly as a faint bronzy tan but then as the hours pass it starts to slowly darken!</li>
            <li> Not good!  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea to wear to the pool!</li>
            <li> I even had several patients jokingly scold me on my tan, and they were shocked when I confessed it was fake!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply and looked dirty</li>
            <li> There were a few bad reviews, but you just have to learn how to apply it</li>
            <li> You can do this in the washing machine with cold water on a delicate cycle and hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on so even,smooth,streak free,and amazing:)!The only downfall I hated was after awhile</li>
            <li> and then he was disappointed that he didn&#x27;t let me spray him down.</li>
            <li> After being sick of being pale</li>
            <li> I have vitilgo and hate wearing shorts in the summer due to that.</li>
            <li> At least 10 of my friends have bought the Fake Bake after seeing me!</li>
            <li> Because the consistency of this product is like water, they don&#x27;t have the cost of mixing in a cream or other base material.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your hands, that&#x27;s what I used to hate about other products.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> complaint was the bottle!!</li>
            <li> I bought it and was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> slowly!!</li>
            <li> This one does not cause my skin to itch quite as bad as the others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb to try this product, as I&#x27;ve had bad luck with sunless tanners in the past.  </li>
            <li> Ice has bad experiences with sunless tanners in the past</li>
            <li> No matter how bad i tried to make it even, it would streak usually</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get the pre-application stuff because this time..it did tend to get into my pores on my legs but not as bad as others in the past.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of it&#x27;s abilities because of all the negative preconceived ideas about &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; sprays.  </li>
            <li> but I was often disappointed that my $30 went to waste on the orange tan that was streaky in areas and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to wash off.</li>
            <li> VERY DRIED THATS WAS THE BAD THING.</li>
            <li> If you have a slight base tan already this might work for you.</li>
            <li> But, I was very disappointed that the tan doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> No more tanning bed for me!!!</li>
            <li> Finally a company that mastered the fake tan in a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying bc</li>
            <li> The smell can be a little annoying after a while though.</li>
            <li> I will refer fake bake to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Whith fake bake that is not the case.</li>
            <li> so I could fake tan and have even skin tone for daughters wedding.</li>
            <li> I have been using the fake bake lotion for years and thought I would give this version</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a fan of Fake Bake for life.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product and was skeptical but thought I&#x27;d give it a go...</li>
            <li> but there are easier ways to fake tan (I think I prefer lotion-based ones).</li>
            <li> For some reason, something went wrong with the shipping</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting lotion on your heels and knees before applying Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I have never used fake tanner before</li>
            <li> so maybe I did something wrong</li>
            <li> , ill have to try to figure that one out.</li>
            <li> People complimented my tan and had no idea it was fake.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but unfortunately it turned me orange.</li>
            <li> So I ordered Fake Bake after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry, Lauen.</li>
            <li> NO MORE ORANGE LEOPARD SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not for me.  </li>
            <li> I am just not one for fake tanning products.</li>
            <li> and I never get that yucky fake tanner line around my wrists.</li>
            <li> I just bought this spray Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> As a novice to self tanner, I was trying to prepare myself by watching tutorials on youtube for this product and the people made it look so effortless but let me just say it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to apply this product.</li>
            <li> Fake bake</li>
            <li> Its not streaky and doesn&#x27;t look fake on me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all of the Fake Bake products and</li>
            <li> I had no idea what to expect with Fake Bake, but here&#x27;s a rundown of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t look weird between my face and neck)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend Fake Bake to everyone</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak, look orange, or smell weird.</li>
            <li> I like Fake Bake</li>
            <li> but it is a bit difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I think the fake bake is a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> Well if you sweat or your clothes run against your skin at all, it creates a creepy weird sweat line anywhere that happens.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not a flawless product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this product again, sadly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Update: sadly this just washes off.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that after about an hour you apply it, it starts to smell AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Thank you Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I take fake tanner well and know the process</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only self-tanner that hasn&#x27;t made me look horribly orange like everything else.  </li>
            <li> It does not look like a \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Be wary of using it around elbows, knuckles, and knees though.</li>
            <li> Nothing can compare to fake bake.</li>
            <li> Use fake bake and avoid the skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> Fake tan without looking fake or streaky</li>
            <li> The color I get is a mere sunkissed look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try fake bake Xtreme and see how that goes.  </li>
            <li> My wife talked me into using fake bake.</li>
            <li> I told them about fake bake</li>
            <li> But fake bake does ,,did not get on my hands at all which is a</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake for about 2 years</li>
            <li> Stopped sitting in sun&lt;br /&gt;for health reasons and Fake Bake lets me look tanned without harmful rays.</li>
            <li> No streaking, and doesn&#x27;t turn your &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; areas into orange weird looking spots (knees, elbows, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been wary of using sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> and I ended up in the grocery store with weird looking splotches where the color began to run.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that after this product, I am a convert to fake tanning.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> So, intro my history of fake tanners.</li>
            <li> That works for any fake tanning product, not just this one.  </li>
            <li> I watched the gal on the u-tube put it on Fake Bake...demonstrating the How.</li>
            <li> sticking to fake bake</li>
            <li> and it does not look fake.</li>
            <li> just want to mention again how well this fake bake tans my chest area.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, a self tanner is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fake bake</li>
            <li> and as skeptical as I am of using any sunless tanners after reading these reviews I tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get past the awful smell.</li>
            <li> Fake bake was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> so I gave fake bake a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely USE GLOVES when applying though because it will stain your hands terribly.</li>
            <li> There is nothing fake looking about the color fake bake gives you.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to conclude that fake tans need to be applied by professionals...</li>
            <li> Fake bake BLEW</li>
            <li> I was tan with fake bake</li>
            <li> Also I noticed once I used fake bake</li>
            <li> then you start using fake bake with the MIT</li>
            <li> maybe Im doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> if you try to build your tan it can look weird</li>
            <li> I ordered the fake bake for face-&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake tanner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake was as advertised....easy to apply, didn&#x27;t turn orange and didn&#x27;t streak.  </li>
            <li> I was sad.</li>
            <li> My co-worker uses Fake Bake and suggested I try</li>
            <li> Listen when everyone says the fake bake looks way fafake.</li>
            <li> I recommend after using Fake Bake, you apply a bronzer on your skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Fake Bake once again.</li>
            <li> I used the Fake Bake for Face 9 years ago.</li>
            <li> I had almost no streaks or weird spots and it lasted quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fake Bake for years</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> so my legs don&#x27;t blind people.</li>
            <li> My sister and I are addicted!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about that fake orange shade that some tanners leave you with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But Fake Bake surpasses them all!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered one for my daughter, now she is hooked on Fake Bake too.</li>
            <li> Scarey.</li>
            <li> But learned my lesson and won&#x27;t being trying the fake tan thing again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just tedious to put on the gloves, and then the mitt and spritz and rub...</li>
            <li> No more sticky spray tanning!!!!</li>
            <li> Just be wary.</li>
            <li> Not orange or fake.</li>
            <li> I was instantly put off by how fake and awful it looked</li>
            <li> I was desperate and tired of reflecting off the sun.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have that fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t look too fake.</li>
            <li> ive since learned it can be toxic since its sprayed into the air and its difficult not to breathe it in.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used every fake suntan product under the sun (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> I use an exfoliating face wash, then apply toner, then Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> when applying but has that weird after smell.  </li>
            <li> Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> and it is so difficult for me to get a tan.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake IS THE BEST.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of these are wrong.</li>
            <li> I like to apply the Tanwise mousse with the gloves and mitt from my Fake Bake kit and it always works perfectly.doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but i have a weird issue with being tan</li>
            <li> With Fake Bake, I can apply it before going out and never notice the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another helpful hint: always wash the mitten thoroughly after each use, with soap, until you&#x27;ve rinsed out all of the fake bake.</li>
            <li> Maybe try the darker version of the fake bake.</li>
            <li> So basically you can not go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> (that fake tanner smell..).</li>
            <li> People couldn&#x27;t tell it was a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I had this really weird itchy reaction to it.</li>
            <li> You can use a scrub, or an exfoliating glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer often, but never before or within four hours after applying fake bake.</li>
            <li> I layer with this Fake Bake product.</li>
            <li> it looked fake....</li>
            <li> ive heard of fake bake before but for some reason i just never tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a tan for pulling all the stops, without looking fake, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a tan for pulling all the stops, without looking fake, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and when you wash if off the next day, there is no glow.</li>
            <li> I have another Fake Bake product that is in a gold can.</li>
            <li> It twists on my hand and makes it difficult to get it all over my body.  </li>
            <li> My arms for example had weird marks where it started wearing off at</li>
            <li> , b/c I always feel really guilty about doing so.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried all kinds of lotions that were suppose to give you a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking tan, including the expensive spray tan at the salon, even tanning beds that I knew were causing damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was going to the beach and did not know how I was going to wear a bathing suit with chubby shocking white thighs.</li>
            <li> Also I had no streaking or any fake looking areas around my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on going to Florida soon, and didn&#x27;t want to blind people with my paleness.</li>
            <li> Putting on self tanner and building up color has always been a tedious task for me</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the face fake bake lotion.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered 2  bottles.</li>
            <li> However, I was unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, from Jergen&#x27;s lotion to spending $40 on a fake bake at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had found Fake Bake sooner.  </li>
            <li> that stuff expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the Fake Bake Glo-Shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic, so I don&#x27;t put any fake tanner on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fake tanning products since I was 12.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I plan on ordering fake bake&#x27;s face tanner soon to try it.</li>
            <li> Use the Fake Bake -</li>
            <li> It does have a fake tan smell and the color indicator will fade onto your sheets and clothing(before showering).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever do fake tan in a hurry...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a self tanner, look no more!!!!</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made me look orange</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t develop a weird smell after application either.</li>
            <li> and it is expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> there is nothing about this that is not excellent.  </li>
            <li> I showered again, the itching subsided, but not the uncomfortable flush feeling.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it is not perfect (I doubt if a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; self tanner exists) which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Before I found Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I have used a tanning bed for years and decided to try Fake and bake (my sister uses it).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t wake up in the morning, but rather at about 3 in the morning when I smelt a faint &amp;#34;gym sock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> WTF is that?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the color</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look to fake or feminine at all.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see where my farmer tan begins and the fake tan ends.  </li>
            <li> I was paying $40 a session to have someone spray me at an expensive and inconveient spray tan place.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint, yet tropical.</li>
            <li> but I recommend getting something else for your face or it will get spotty and attracts towards your pours making your face look weird.</li>
            <li> I used a combination of Skin-So-Soft and some body lotion on my knees, elbows, feet, and hands before applying the Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I also purchased Fake Bake Face Bake and use it for my face.</li>
            <li> I was a needlessly concerned because I didn&#x27;t buy the exfoliater.</li>
            <li> kinda has a weird smell though...</li>
            <li> I used to be obsessed with tanning until I ha</li>
            <li> , even my hubby was skeptical but he also said it wasn&#x27;t orange or fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> ; that makes it look fake.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to buy it in any store, so</li>
            <li> and she said she applied fake bake 3 days in a row and after that once a week.</li>
            <li> Im a fake bake tan  </li>
            <li> Unable to locate a production date either, so how do you know whether the product is within the 10 month shelf life?  </li>
            <li> Enter Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> Putting on Fake Bake was like this:</li>
            <li> So I went on a limb and bought Fake Bake, and I don&#x27;t ever need to look for another tanning product.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product (or Fake Bake) to anyone.    </li>
            <li> I contacted Fake Bake regarding my concerns on a product.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience, I do not recommend Fake Bake as a company, and I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I got in contact with a Fake Bake representative (mary@fakebake.com)</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;by Fake Bake\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I did tons of research and fake bake</li>
            <li> I showered and then reapplied and went to work (again, a faint sunless tan smell but not offensive at work)</li>
            <li> and I told him no, it was fake bake</li>
            <li> this fake bake gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used every drugstore brand, Avon products, and expensive department store and salon brands.</li>
            <li> no perfect product, but everybody can learn if this one works for her or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i imagine for the haireir guys this would be mandatory to avoid weird streaking patterns.  </li>
            <li> and then it went horribly wrong.</li>
            <li> I found it in Ulta but its too expensive there</li>
            <li> I’m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Fake Bake Aerosol</li>
            <li> I use the fake bake exfoliation gel as well.</li>
            <li> worries about streaking like with spraying Fake Bake alone.</li>
            <li> Just one wrong product choice</li>
            <li> So-so results, difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It also has a faint smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a Fake Bake customer for years.</li>
            <li> bought the fake bake lotion</li>
            <li> I bought the fake bake lotion</li>
            <li> the brown sponge is useless.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake get your packaging</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product based on how difficult application was.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using a mit</li>
            <li> I bought fake bake for face, and it worked so well,</li>
            <li> so self tanning is a necessary evil for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even feel the need to put on foundation when I&#x27;m tanned with Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I USE ON MY FACE TO AND PLAN TO TRY THE FACE FAKE BAKE THO SINCE ITS MADE FOR FACE AN</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day of using the fake bake i used my Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> After searching the web for a recommended at-home product, I decided to order Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Using Fake Bake I like the way that it smells.</li>
            <li> When i tell people its fake tanner they&#x27;re like &amp;#34; no way!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> After exfoliating well (don&#x27;t forget toes), apply just a dab of lotion (any brand) on feet, knees and elbows before using Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over think it cause it really is fail proof if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Unless I have some unrealistic idea of what a tan should look like??</li>
            <li> I used it to even out a weird sunburn on my legs and shoulders</li>
            <li> I have used Fake Bake products off &amp; on for 5 years</li>
            <li> I want I use Fake Bake about 3 days in a row</li>
            <li> so when I finish this bottle I&#x27;m going to try Fake Bake Darker.</li>
            <li> So as I thought about other options, I remembered getting spray tanned and hated the fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sunlabs due to all the hype and hated it.&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed in this one in particular. :-(</li>
            <li> I am naturally pale and it is impossible for my to build a tan!</li>
            <li> Not good or bad -</li>
            <li> My friends legs are consistently pale and hairy, I applied this as directed and was shocked!</li>
            <li> Loreal is for women and has glitter in it, streaking and just looks bad and smells worse.</li>
            <li> Once I heard about the negative affects that a tanning bed can have on your skin, I switched to self tanners, which were all CRAP until I cam across FakeBake.</li>
            <li> smell as awful as some of the other self tanners i have</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like tanning booths, or some of the other self tanning products with that terrible smell that lingers for days..</li>
            <li> Ive used other products that develop a horrible smell after a while.</li>
            <li> I have even sent this product as a gift to some friends up north who have not seen sunlight in months due to this horrible winter weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanners that smell awful</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very skeptical; boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> The color guard is shocking at 1st as it is dark, but it washes off.</li>
            <li> Basically, you cannot use this during the day because if you wash your hands and water runs down your arm, you have horrible splotches.  </li>
            <li> The mit leaves sponge prints and nasty streaks--places where the liquid is a little thicker and therefor dries darker by morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the people with bad reviews did wrong, but there&#x27;s a reason that almost 2,000 reviews still give this product almost 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look fake and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> fake bake does not have the bad smell others do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to go tanning because of how bad it is for you and how expensive it can be.</li>
            <li> and the bottle leaks like crazy.</li>
            <li> it makes my face look dirty</li>
            <li> Too afraid to try my face just yet.</li>
            <li> I was deathly afraid of oompa loompa land but was encouraged by the pics and reviews.</li>
            <li> : The color payoff was disappointing.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> The color starts fading after a couple of days and in some places I do feel like it fades blotchy and makes me look dirty</li>
            <li> its always orange, patchy and makes me look dirty .</li>
            <li> it will show up as looking dirty.</li>
            <li> (afraid it would be splotchy)</li>
            <li> but it just did nothing for me besides leaving me with a dirty bathtub.</li>
            <li> (was afraid to do my arms until I seen if it was gonna streak.)</li>
            <li> I recommend cutting the straw</li>
            <li> It is a MUST that you exfoliate like crazy for this product to go on evenly.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m afraid to use it</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look like a dirty, stripy freakazoid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawbacks: it is recommended that you sleep with the product applied to your skin, so the bed linens will get dirty.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this YEARS ago instead of dangerously using a tanning booth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-prone to make face look awkwardly brown.</li>
            <li> it will make u look dirty  </li>
            <li> Even after cutting the tube shorter like one reviewer suggested, it still leaked everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I realized that I am unhappy with this tanner and won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> but I am too afraid of sun damage and skin cancer to go tanning all the time.  </li>
            <li> It will not make you look orange or dirty like some self tanners do.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing...</li>
            <li> I did a couple times and each time it just made my face look dirty.</li>
            <li> An at-home product that does not smell, lasts well, and doesn&#x27;t look orange, dirty, smudgy, streaky, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale-skinned, Caucasian &amp; burn like crazy.  </li>
            <li> and it had turned a horrible green color and went rotten.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get spotty, also wash the mitt you dirty hippy.</li>
            <li> I also do suggest cutting the spray straw a bit so</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping over night with it on as it recommends, I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning and showered before bed as I don&#x27;t want my sheets to get dirty.</li>
            <li> diseased look</li>
            <li> My face looked muddy dirty.</li>
            <li> and I use semi cold water...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade awkwardly.</li>
            <li> Which was awkward.</li>
            <li> But I found it works horrible on your face and is does turn orange colored after a few days..</li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS.</li>
            <li> Well, I exfoliated like crazy, paying attention to my knees and ankles.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on, you will wake up looking dirty, but once you shower and rinse it off, it will look better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fades horribly blotchy and made my pale self look</li>
            <li> I will never get another brand - I am a fake bake customer for life!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake makes you look like you have been to the beach!</li>
            <li> I wrong!</li>
            <li> the color wouldn&#x27;t stay &amp; I always had to be buying expensive lotions!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ignore the exfoliating requirement or you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
            <li> It was the worst, blotchy, uneven color!</li>
            <li> did I realize Fake Bake makes another product for darker skin!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is revolutionary!</li>
            <li> I am a fake baker for life!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re comparing this to the Fake Bake 60 minute, get this!</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> I am so obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FAKE BAKE!</li>
            <li> so mad</li>
            <li> Ill never use another self tanner again!</li>
            <li> Might become obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> A Fake Bake winner!</li>
            <li> and I did not have ONE streak or weird coloring spot!</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried the Fake Bake line, I am hooked!  </li>
            <li> No need for fake tanning anymore!</li>
            <li> I tried self tanner in the past and it was horrible</li>
            <li> your Fake Bake won&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> Thank you Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> But for some reason it doesn&#x27;t blend in on my hands,and when I tried to put the fake and bake contents on my hands it turned them ORANGE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with it and may purchase this tanner just to get another mitt!</li>
            <li> No one has asked if I use fake tan, yay!)</li>
            <li> My friends could not tell it was a fake tan -- not even a hint of orange!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> so you can smear fake all over their face too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticing with this fake bake spary!</li>
            <li> fake bake pleasssse?!</li>
            <li> This will be my go to fake tanning product!</li>
            <li> I am going to buy the barrier cream and everything else by Fake Bake ASAP!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have never found a fake tanner that works as well a this one!  </li>
            <li> - I owe it all to fake bake!</li>
            <li> After using Fake Bake, I won&#x27;t ever use another sunless tanning product, and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!  </li>
            <li> promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the way to go!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fool proof, but very expensive, so I found this fake bake here on amazon and read some reviews and thought I would give it a try since it was so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> way to fake - it is definitely a FAKE BAKE!!</li>
            <li> Over time the scent fades and it doesn&#x27;t leave an unpleasant self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical when it came to self-tan products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult to get it even so it looks spotty in areas.  </li>
            <li> but it is very, very faint.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about self tanner products.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because all these self tanners turn me orange and they streak.</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical about sunless tanners, but when my sister in law told me about this</li>
            <li> This fading makes it very difficult to build color with this tanner.  </li>
            <li> I ended up ordering fake bake darker to go over it once the base color didn&#x27;t get any deeper.</li>
            <li> I was very  skeptical about trying this.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to apply and turned out quite splotchy--I will post pics.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to keep the mitt on your hand during use.</li>
            <li> it looks blotchy and very fake</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical of trying this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Orange, I have also decided I prefer lotion to spray, it wears off terrible and all around sucks for the price.</li>
            <li> which ... makes application nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible to avoid the streak marks.</li>
            <li> So anyone afraid they are going to do it wrong, don&#x27;t feel that way!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave me looking streaky.. and the smell was not too bad..</li>
            <li> but definatley smelled like self tanner, the developing odor wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some tanners, and I even put this on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad though.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year now and have nothing bad to say about it.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad though.</li>
            <li> I will stay that it still smells, but not as bad as some.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how bad it smells.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as the others either.</li>
            <li> that make u smell SOOO bad....</li>
            <li> in this product isn&#x27;t that bad at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad (to me</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as others, but it reminded me of a hair spray smell.</li>
            <li> And it smells sooooo bad.</li>
            <li> I might just be really bad at applying self tanner though</li>
            <li> but I read some of the reviews that talked about the spray area leaking really bad &amp;</li>
            <li> It leaks so bad I had to buy a spray cap to replace the one that came with it.</li>
            <li> It dosent smell bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with self tanners and even tho</li>
            <li> So nobody saw the bad tan job I did</li>
            <li> Bad for faces</li>
            <li> The smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can go bad once it has been opened however, the product should be used up within 6 mos or refrigerated to keep longer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and after having it on for 8 hours and showing the color was still on.</li>
            <li> The smell was not even that bad.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re all going to smell bad on the skin even after showering until the color has faded away.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as some brands.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to use gloves because it stains so bad.</li>
            <li> I had bad luck with it.  </li>
            <li> so it had time to fade before work on Monday if it was bad.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell bad nor does it appear orangey or streaky, there is a mitt that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> -Still smells like sunless tanner, not as bad so some, but the smell is just unavoidable</li>
            <li> While the smell isn&#x27;t too bad, the smell will transfer onto your clothes (alot)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the bad characteristics.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it on a whim and used it the night before our shoot (probably a bad idea).</li>
            <li> so I know how bad some sunless tanning products can be!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOTHING BAD</li>
            <li> want to go to the tanning bed or go spray tanning because it&#x27;s so bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell bad or turn my skin green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad so  </li>
            <li> so I am writing this off as just a bad product.</li>
            <li> I heard that self tanners are bad, they streak, look orange, etc.</li>
            <li> If it turned out badly, I could always wear pants until it faded.</li>
            <li> , smell bad, make you orange, etc.</li>
            <li> Which totally shocked me.</li>
            <li> No one can ever tell I use self tanners, they are always shocked when I tell them.  </li>
            <li> Terrible orange color, worse than any product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I was sort of shocked</li>
            <li> no matter the color result, the \\&quot;getting there&#x27; just too painful.</li>
            <li> I got a bad headache and it made me sick.</li>
            <li> my husband is sick of me going on and on about this tanner, so I thought that I might as well write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to look sick.</li>
            <li> but I dont want to get sick from them</li>
            <li> I have followed all product recommendations, too bad :(</li>
            <li> BUT STINKS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off too bad for me, of course I have a base tan.</li>
            <li> I never tan in the sun, I&#x27;m too afraid to!</li>
            <li> ::(</li>
            <li> Also, I did not notice a building of tan either, which I was disappointed about.</li>
            <li> I have used this before based on Amazon reviews and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i probably would not buy this one again.&lt;br /&gt;disappointed. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish it was still on the subscribe and save list though :(</li>
            <li> I could still smell it after my shower and perfume :(</li>
            <li> , i wish it lasted me a week :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Correct: (__*__)           </li>
            <li> Correct: (  o  )</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that adding layers did not darken my skin at all</li>
            <li> I know, I&#x27;m crazy!)</li>
            <li> Trust me, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> It streaks ad doesn&#x27;t deliver as it says it does:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that horrible look getting caught in the rain after an expensive spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are worried about trying fake tan and then it looking horrible or you messing up, just remember it&#x27;s not permanent!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the darkness of the tan.</li>
            <li> It gets product everywhere in my bathroom :(</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed if you don&#x27;t layer it!!hope</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It definatly doesnt look fake!!</li>
            <li> Even my family can&#x27;t tell that its not the sun giving me the tan!Yay for fake bake!!</li>
            <li> D&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much fake bake!!</li>
            <li> And the name FAKE BAKE is a riot!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what that means because the leaking is coming from the base where it screws off and also the nozzle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided I was over being tan and didn&#x27;t want to rub that toxic crap all over my body.  </li>
            <li> I already have a base tan might I add.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that rank self tanner smell</li>
            <li> And I hate being so....</li>
            <li> I could sniff you out of a crowd if you had this on, just my opinion, I hate how it smells.</li>
            <li> so you have to keep re applying every night/day which I hate.</li>
            <li> I used it 5 days in a row to establish base, then 2-3 days/wk to maintain.</li>
            <li> My bottle leaks out the side when I spray it which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate guide colors however.</li>
            <li> I had from a base tan</li>
            <li> I will continue using this while I build up a summer base tan.</li>
            <li> I Had to do two Base applications before I was satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I hate the feel of lotion, it makes me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to assist me in getting into the summer season and give me a base tan</li>
            <li> So then if you hate the color on you, you can remove it (or just scrub it off)</li>
            <li> If you have a base already then this will just enhance your tan.</li>
            <li> &amp;I hate that blotchy look.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying fuzzies are aggravating.</li>
            <li> I had decided to not tan until tanning season, but practically hate myself when I have no color.</li>
            <li> I used to get airbrushed...but found it looked like crap in about 3 days...</li>
            <li> That was annoying having drips everywhere.</li>
            <li> Spray tanning booths got very expensive!</li>
            <li> Nasty stale smell plus sticky as crap!</li>
            <li> but if you are like me and have bad skin, it is the worst thing you could put on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the mystic spray tan and hated it, it lasted a couple days and smelled rank, and I&#x27;ve done banana boat and jergens lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell bad either!</li>
            <li> But we had a horrible vacation anyways, it just rained &amp; rained, and was cold!</li>
            <li> I am shocked!</li>
            <li> and they are shocked!</li>
            <li> It truly doesn&#x27;t not give an ugly orange color...or streak!  </li>
            <li> I found things I hated about all of them.</li>
            <li> HATED it  </li>
            <li> It had been years since I have tried a sunless tanner because I hated the smell they would leave on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I hated it</li>
            <li> I hated self-tanners bc</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always hated my legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have always hated self tanner.</li>
            <li> Both are streaky and I hated the results (or lack of)</li>
            <li> cause they are very bad.</li>
            <li> also caused my skin to itch very badly...</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Purchase this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Buy it, read directions and try it --you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tanning is dangerous!!  </li>
            <li> But I was disappointed to find out this product DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!</li>

            <li> Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product .</li>
            <li> thank you fake bake!!!</li>
            <li> bye bye expensive spray tans!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t the worst self tanner I ever used</li>
            <li> SORRY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It looked as if I had some horrible skin disease.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t put off that awful self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I looked awful.</li>
            <li> All turned me orange and/or smelled disgusting.</li>
            <li> Everyone said it has a tropical scent and that sold me being that jergens smelled horribly when the color was being actviated.</li>
            <li> it started to break out horribly within 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell like that nasty sunless tan smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange, it&#x27;s not streaky, and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a terrible sunless tan smell.</li>
            <li> Worst garbage ever.</li>
            <li> they are terrifying</li>
            <li> It smelled horrible, but it didn&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> it was horrible!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all, which I was fearful of!</li>
            <li> However I hate sleeping with it on my skin and smelling that smell all night!!</li>
            <li> This product was awful.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have the awful smell some products have.</li>
            <li> It does not have a nasty self tanner odor.</li>
            <li> but the smell on my skin after awhile was terrible &amp; it would turn orangey-yellowy-brown on my skin</li>
            <li> but this was the worst.</li>
            <li> its not that its a horrible smell but</li>
            <li> but it would take about 5 or 6 days to get that - awful - color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> horrible, yuk..</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> the worst that happened was the color faded from my body, and I reapplied it that night.</li>
            <li> I had some terrible streaks, despite using gloves.</li>
            <li> I used to tan once a week, but tanning beds are SO awful for you</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty smell</li>
            <li> That awful sunless tanner smell kicks in about 2 hours after applying.</li>
            <li> BUT the color is awful!</li>
            <li> but my neck and chest area...in those areas it faded horribly in patches and spots.</li>
            <li> yes i realize horrible for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking (hens the name!!)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like that nasty chemically smell that some self tanners do.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle leaks horribly at the point where the cap twists on.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for me, but I didn&#x27;t put it anywhere else on my body in fear of looking horrible.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, so you can apply it and go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried self tanners before and they all smell horrible and come out splotchy.</li>
            <li> It smells awful</li>
            <li> Once I did get a reply, they were downright condescending and insulting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that awful self-tanner smell.  </li>
            <li> It does not have that horrible sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> each and every one just built up and started to look awful, and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Worst that can happen is another orange week right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well!</li>
            <li> Toom a chance with Fake-Bake, and was shocked at how well this product works!!</li>
            <li> Use Fake Bake!!!!</li>
            <li> all because I hate tanning beds!</li>
            <li> The worst color I have even seen in a self tanner</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world.</li>
            <li> Oh and it does not have a nasty smell to it either!</li>
            <li> This one is horrible.</li>
            <li> I wanted a tan to kinda shade them but didnt want to lay in a horrible tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I do however encourage that you build a bit of a real, base tan before you start using the product.</li>
            <li> My worst nightmare about sunless tanners is looking orange and it happened with this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because the ease of application, but a one because it is just like all the rest for me and gave me horrible \\&quot;unreal\\&quot; looking results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far this works great! Love how you can see where it&#x27;s going on and the bronze is a nice color. The mitt is an added bonus, to not having to scrub your hands down after.</li>
            <li> I love this! This is my first time using fake bake products and I love the fact that it has a color guide to show me the places I&#x27;ve missed. The after color when it&#x27;s washed off was a natural dark color and I love it. This is the first product I have found that didn&#x27;t leave streaks on me and that actually made me look alot darker. Will Def keep using this!!!!</li>
            <li> By far the best stuff around!  Easy to apply.  Very little mess.  Does not turn you orange and NO streaking.  I will refer fake bake to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> love this product! lasts a while, i would not use though without applying lotion to you skin first.</li>
            <li> this stuff works well! No sticky icky feel after applying! Feels Soft!  Really though, i&#x27;ve purchased quite a few other tanners, and this one is my favorite. It makes your skin feel extremely soft, and not sticky or itchy. It also tans instantly! so you have to be careful, and make sure you rub it in good right away. I&#x27;ve never used it on my face, jus cause im scared i would mess up, and look funny or not rub in good enough. Like i said it gives you an instant bronze tan, looks very natural, but used a different lighter tan lotion for face. This stuff is great, and smells great. Shipping was fast, and package was secure. Good luck! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product except the mitten starts to wear down quickly</li>
            <li> Pricey and only last a couple days</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; like most self tanning lotions and the coverage/color is beautiful. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.... I would deffinatley recommend it to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used, and I have used many!  It goes on without any streaking.  Your skin actually feels moisterized and soft when you wake up in the morning.  It smells nice too. I have had many people say something about how beautiful my tan looks.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  You definitely want to make sure that you exfoliate and moisturize your skin prior to using it.  It goes on well with no streaking and I love the color.  Very easy to use !</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake sunless tanning system is a must for streakless and natural tanning results.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Easy to apply, decent smell, and pretty color.  It doesn&#x27;t last forever, which I also like... it fades smoothly and not in blotches.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS! This has to be one of my favorite self tanners, it does not turn you orange, easy application with the mitt it comes with, and drys super fast!! Would highly recommend to anyone who needs that extra glow!</li>
            <li> This works! Goes on easily and smells good too. Have to take it easy on the face though or you can look overly done.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Left nasty streaks on my skin and looked so blotchy and un natural!</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than I wanted getting here but I have used this product before when I bought t from ulta for 40-SOME DOLLARS! It was a joy I tell you to find it so affordable on amazon. I have fairly fair skin and often take forever to get a tan on my own and cause my freckles to explode. When I have used self tanners before I usually turn out looking like a caution cone. Whith fake bake that is not the case. I get a lovely bronze color. My only complaint is that one coat doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but I heard that the fake bake flawless darker does so I think I will try the next.</li>
            <li> It makes me tan instantly, great! However if I get a little water or something on my arm, the color guide washes away and you can totally tell I have a fake tan on. I would really not recommend putting this on at night as the directions say... I have light gray sheets and they were brown all over from the color guide rubbing off! (This is after I waited two hours for it to fully &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;). Love the color, hate that it rubs off so fast.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. Quick and easy to apply. Not orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> I had spent weeks bleaching age spots and imperfections from my arms &amp; legs so I could fake tan and have even skin tone for daughters wedding. As soon as I applied it the product brought all the discoloration back and I had to jump in shower. It was a nice realistic color otherwise, just not good for my older skin.</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake. It was my first experience with a self-tanner as I always stayed away from them as they have a reputation to look fake. This has a really nice tan cool tone. It really digs into large pores, though, so it&#x27;s hard to apply to the face because you can&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll get dark streaks. It&#x27;s bad on blemishes and scars in general, so be warmed if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this to cover up any imperfections, because I&#x27;ve found it enhances them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last long after using it the first week. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and even doing multiple applications it is gone in a couple days. I still really like the results though, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot.. The only con is it takes for ever to set and dry other the that the color turns out fine for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product  -completely eliminated the need for tanning booth. Smooth application and build able - scent is pleasant- really great all together</li>
            <li> I purchased this 4/18/2013. I have been using the fake bake lotion for years and thought I would give this version a try.&lt;br /&gt;The color is good, natural looking shade not orange at all. The applicator was shedding/pilling after about 4 uses. I  washed it out after every use too, I was spreading brown fuzz all over me. This  version tends to streak a bit more than the lotion, the bronzer to \\&quot;show where it goes\\&quot; didn&#x27;t stand out enough for me so I missed spots.  The liquid had a tendency to settle into pores and hair follicles leaving little brown dots.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t the worst self tanner I ever used but it  was way trickier to get it just right. I think I will stick to the original fake bake lotion. Its been the best I have ever used .</li>
            <li> I have what is considered alabaster skin-I burn, have never tanned in my life. When I was a child and outside all the time, all I did was freckle. I have tried numerous products -over the years, now in my 40&#x27;s and have never found one that A. didn&#x27;t turn me orange, B, wasn&#x27;t too dark for alabaster, C, didn&#x27;t streak, D, didn&#x27;t require a PhD in tanning to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only say thank you thank you to one of the reviewers -she gave very specific instructions and they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a fan of Fake Bake for life.</li>
            <li> Awesome self tanner without a horrible smell.  Put it on the night before my college graduation and turned my body a nice golden tan, instead of a smelly carrot.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck happened but the product I received was in a PINK bottle with a snap lid and it did NOT come with a spray nozzle. The picture is very misleading as it shows in the picture a spray nozzle on a purple bottle. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Not having the spray nozzle made applying this a hassle and honestly not worth the effort when there are MANY products with an easy spray nozzle. Pain in my freaking ass. Also, I looked at video reviews online. Lots of people said they got 10 plus full body tans with this product with spraying it on their body and not on the mitt. SINCE I HAD NO NOZZLE I resorted to just pouring it directly on the mitt and I lost a lot of product. My bottle is pretty much half empty. I would love it if it came with a nozzle like the misleading picture said that it would. The company needs to take care of this issue as I would have givin this product more stars. I can&#x27;t in good conscience knowing they are misleading consumers. SORRY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent results! This gives me the desired look of a tan without the sun exposure. Not messy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The least smelly self tanner!</li>
            <li> Product does not even spray out of the bottle it leaks and spills on everything and if you have it on and you get even a little overheated it turns the inside of your clothes red.I put it on at night after exfolating as it said let it dry very well before dressing and the next day for about 10 minutes looked good went outside to do some gardening and it just started running went and took another shower and it all washed off.Note to self NEVER BUT THIS AGAIN HUDGE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I have fair, fair skin and need something to take the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; away.  this gives you the option of a deep dark tan if u want or a little light color which is what I needed.  would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use other self tanners but I love this one .... There were NO STREAKS on my skin , It was really easy to rub on and for a spray bottle it was not messy at all in thee end I had a nice golden tan .... Not orange like the ones I tried before .</li>
            <li> This stuff really is great. My legs were too white for me to feel comfortable wearing a skirt, so what I do when I&#x27;m in too much of a hurry to do my whole body is rub some just on my legs after getting out of the shower (just a small amount) and then I&#x27;m ready to put on a skirt and head out the door. No discernible smell at all!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This looks like a real tan.And out of the few brands of fake tan stuff I&#x27;ve tried this smells the best.It stil has an odor to it but not half as bad as the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product. read first review from Glenis Ewing. She did a great review. Thanks Glenis. The Xen tan blending balm is what makes this product perfect</li>
            <li> I have never used self tanners before and this was honestly great an even application all the way around I loved it 👌🏻</li>
            <li> This is probably the most natural looking self tanner I have found. Very light, not greasy, dries fast and keeps hands clean. I used to use my hands to apply self tanners only to end up with brown areas between my fingers. Not a pretty sight. The glove that it comes with is a genius solution. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this tanning spray! I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect one that wouldn&#x27;t cause streaking, a bad smell or worse the orange tone. This went on perfect, didn&#x27;t actually have a smell (at least I didn&#x27;t really smell one) and people actually thought I had been tanning at the salon. Living in North Carolina and being from Florida it&#x27;s impossible to accept the white skin tone but this is so perfect! Look no further I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed! PS apply in your shower because this stuff will get everywhere. Much easier to clean up in a shower.</li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers, can not get tan.  I get pink. But this looks believable, I use only one \\&quot;coat\\&quot; so my white legs won&#x27;t scare anyone.  It&#x27;s like nail polish, in that DON&#x27;T put on extra! Just do enough for one application, do the second the next day. Just be sure to blend and not forget your feet and backs of your hands!  There are great YouTube videos that show you how to put it on.  I will never get another brand - I am a fake bake customer for life!</li>
            <li> Wow! These reviews were right. Used it for my wedding day. Usually I am either super pale or pretty pink with no in between. This stuff actually made me look like I had a real tan. No orange. No streaks. Just nice natural looking tan tint to my skin. I watched youtube videos on how to apply and it was super easy. I highly recommend this self tanner. If I go the bottle route again - this one will be the only one I ever use. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This was my first year using Fake Bake and I love it!  So much better than the other products I used in the past! I have been telling others how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural!!</li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth with the microfiber mitt they include. Not orange but brown and i love that it is an instant tan.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical when it came to self-tan products. I did a little research and decided to try this product. I have read some reviews that stated the gloves that came with it were very flimsy but I must say that after using it about 5 times, my gloves have not ripped. This product does come with a mitt that you put the product on with. I recommend that you wash the mitt in the washer not by hand. by doing this it will decrease the amount of shedding from the mitt. This product does not turn me orange and I have fair skin. I am a nice golden brown and im so happy that I decided to try this product. I LOVE IT and will NOT go without it from here on out. If you are a beginner I would suggest watching a few you tube videos on how to apply it. it is easy but you may pick up a couple tips :)</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless truly is what they say! I used as directed. I got a nice even natural tan. I applied lightly the first time to make sure that it didn&#x27;t appear orange or out of the bottle tan. It did not Iook orange looks natural I am really happy with this product and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fake tanners and this is the absolute best.  It leaves a great and natural olive color, and is idiot proof in application.  An absolute steal</li>
            <li> Think I prefer the lotion type</li>
            <li> A little streaky - but good stuff overall!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Seems to work great.  We generally only do one application per week because she is so pale.  She doesn&#x27;t want it to look like she obviously used a fake tanner.  You have to be careful with hands, feet, and elbows.  She is also very slender so we have to be careful around her collarbone area.  We are getting better and faster with the application process.  She must like the results because she keeps asking me to tan her.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early spring before prom and all of the other senior activities that I wanted to look great for. This is so easy to apply, and I am a self tanner newbie. It goes on so flawlessly and easily. My tan looked a lot better than some of my friend&#x27;s professional spray tans (which cost so much more!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this correctly is key. Apply before bed so that the tanner has time to soak in. Make sure not to have any lotions/moisturizers on the skin before applying. I prepped my skin by taking a shower and using dove&#x27;s sensitive skin bar of soap. I think the more basic, plain CLEAN you get your skin the better. Then exfoliate with shower gloves/mitts. I shave after cleaning and exfoliating my skin, in order to get the closest shave possible. You basically want to get your skin as bare and clean as possible in order for the product to go on smoothly with out blotches or streaks, this also helps to allow the product to really soak in, giving it more staying power. After doing all of the above I apply the tanning liquid with the mitt provided. I recommend wearing dark pajamas, long sleeve shirt and pants. Some of the product will rub off and this way it won&#x27;t noticeably stain your pajamas and minimally stains your sheets. I like to moisturize my skin the next day so to lock in the tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good tip that I found if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you get your back is to spray some of the tanning liquid onto a dark rag/towel and as if you were drying your back off, with one hand hold the top of the towel and one hand hold the bottom, wiping the towel across your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product gave me a beautiful, even tan that lasted for about a week. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable, and easy to use self tanner. Although it&#x27;s not the fastest, I think properly prepping your skin and applying this right makes a world of difference. I plan on using this throughout the summer to maintain a beautiful tan, without the damage from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: One bottle of this has lasted me 6 applications so far, and I have probably 3/4 more left.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use tanning beds and the sun is just too harsh. This is a great alternative to skin cancer. My mom being almost completely Irish, the sun has given her pre-cancerus skin. So this is a safe way to have that California Kissed Skin look. Very easy to apply and control the amount of tan you want to be. Absolutely love this product! Makes you smell, look, and feel great! Smoothes your skin too!</li>
            <li> Wish the mit would be more durable, after a few uses it doesn&#x27;t apply the product very well but the tanner itself works great. I use pretanner gel so my tan lasts longer so i dont need to apply more then twice a week.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it actually works!! (:</li>
            <li> Fake Bake makes you look like you have been to the beach! I&#x27;m very fair (blonde hair/blue eyes) and this works great on me! Just make sure you exfoliate very well!</li>
            <li> The customer service is excellent and so is the product! I apply it on my face to get a nice color that would take many hours in the sun to achieve.  This product gives that same look in seconds.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!  Natural looking and easy.  LOVE the mit.  glad this available.  Best self tanner I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have every used. I use it year round.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews that there was no smelly odor and it was true. Itʻs a great product for those looking for a great tan without the sun rays. Iʻve had skin cancer, so I have to be careful and this gives me a bit of color that I canʻt get elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel this product gives you exactly what it promises, but a word to those with sensitive skin - I developed a rash on my wrists after two applications (the first and second night I had the product).  It took about 3 days for the rash to disappear.  Thinking that I may have touched something else that bothered me, I gave it another try, this time just one application.  However, I developed a rash that began on my wrists, but extended all the way up my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to let you know to be careful and try it out before a big event.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two weeks and I love it! I am not naturally pale, but this definitely helps give me the golden tan that I want without having to use tanning beds anymore. I read some people&#x27;s comments about it not working or it \\&quot;sweating off brown\\&quot;.. well it works best for me if I put it on right after showering/before bed. When I wake up and shower, the excess color DOES comes off, BUT it does leave a natural looking tan. Just use it a few nights in a row to get the color that you want.</li>
            <li> There are like 2,000 reviews but here are my 2 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last experience with self tanners involved a tub that was never quite the same again and my transformation into a set double for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory…….yeah, I don&#x27;t want to talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with cautious optimism and looked at it for 3 months because in case 2,000 people lied, I didn&#x27;t really feel like buying Comet in bulk and the possibility of being housebound in oompa-loompa shame for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I wrong! This wasn&#x27;t messy at all to apply, though I did stand in the shower just in case. You just spritz the mist on the glove and rub a dub. There is no bending in odd angles naked in the shower while a very very good friend spray paints your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We&#x27;re still friends BTW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product broke my tanning habit. I&#x27;d quit because I really didn&#x27;t think it was good for my skin and had been pale for about 6 months, plus it really was time consuming and a little expensive. Professional spray tanning wasn&#x27;t an option for everyday as it was way to expensive and apparently some of the chemicals in it aren&#x27;t that great….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dries quickly and you can get dressed within 10 minutes - not 2 hours (did I mention my last self-tanning adventure involved sitting naked in the tub watching Golden Girls for 2 hours?). I don&#x27;t advise going and sitting butt naked on, oh maybe you&#x27;re mother-in-law&#x27;s white couch but it really is pretty set after 10 minutes or so.c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one negative to this product:&lt;br /&gt;It will fail to forcibly confine you to your bathroom naked with a good friend watching Betty White for two hours wondering how in the hell you are going to explain what happened to the tub to mom.</li>
            <li> Product arrived soaked in the tanning fluid with a big hole in the box. Everything was brown and the bottle was leaking and half gone. Luckily Amazon reimbursed me but the product itself is okay if you want a quick tan look but it doesn&#x27;t last long after you shower. Also after you apply it you will have the tan smell and don&#x27;t get wet or you&#x27;ll have light spots, especially don&#x27;t sweat or there will be brown rain.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner ever, the mitt is awesome it goes on so dry and smells great and it works awesome, day three and I am super dark, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Very good product but doesn&#x27;t give a very dark tan. It smells and applies great, but if your looking for a very brown tan I would go with the million dollar tan products. I love the fake bake flawless because I want a subtle tan so it doesn&#x27;t look overly fake or shocking if I am pale one day and dark the next. Completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying the product does work. It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and reading reviews and watching a couple YouTube videos helped tremendously with application. It&#x27;s natural looking and not at all orange-y. I do have a few splotchy areas here and there, but I&#x27;ve only applied this four times so far. I&#x27;m hoping this gets better with more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Now my reason for only a 3 star rating...this product stained my $200 ivory sheets and shirt! I can understand the shirt, I put it on immediately after application. The sheets however...I did not get in my bed until 3 HOURS after applying! Just be warned, product can still stain well after it&#x27;s dry. Another important thing to note, application can get pretty messy. As others suggested, DO apply in empty tub or shower and aim low as the over spray gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to apply, just spray on after a shower, and rub in with the included pad. It also comes with gloves to wear under the pad, so it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands. You will definitely want to use the gloves. I&#x27;ve been applying this once a week and I have a great, even looking tan without tanning for hours. It looks very natural, and isn&#x27;t splotchy or runny. I&#x27;ve sprayed this on my bathroom floor by accident and it wipes off easily without staining. I will be buying this again when I run out. It will be nice to have a tan in the winter when I can&#x27;t get out so much.</li>
            <li> After using many products on my pure white legs, this is fantastic. It&amp;#34;s so long lasting. I used it once and  4 days later, still look tan. It is not orange, nor streaky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I have tried so many self tanners in the past with bad results. I am very pale skinned. Burn every time in the sun. This looks so natural and NO STREAKS!! Its super easy to apply. The mitt did leave a few fuzz balls but nothing that wouldn&#x27;t come off. The smell is a tropical scent. The next day it does begin to have the normal self tanner smell. But def. tolerable. I highly recommend and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Bought this after seeing reviews. I like it. Price is great compared to other products. Good size bottle. Like the mitt. Have used it a few days and seems I have to go over the same areas that look &amp;#34;missed.&amp;#34; My arms look fine, but legs not so much.(did exfoliate) In my case I just wanted some color for vacation, so not so concerned.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but would probably look at some others to find&lt;br /&gt;what is the best one for ME..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self-tanner I have ever used, it works great and no streaks at all! I put it on before bed and in the morning I take a shower. I am very fair skin so I have to apply it on at least two or three times a week  before I get the shade I want. Then the tan is good for about five days. I suggest buying a blending balm for the feet and hand areas. It is super easy to apply and you can dress right after.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for those who cannot tan in the sun or in the tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;Just a reminder to spread evenly as it will leave a mark if not done so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who has stayed away from tanning because of my fair skin. I have stayed away from spray tanning because it&#x27;s just such a process. I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s only 5 minutes in there... You gotta wait to shower, it gets on your clothes, it smells, etc... I read the reviews of this product and was skeptical but thought I&#x27;d give it a go... WOW! All I have to say is I&#x27;m happy I got two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I always need two major exfoliation days to get the leftovers of a spray tan off. With this product, I haven&#x27;t had that issue at all. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks straight and it looks as good as it did the first day I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks completely natural and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a mit that has application be really easy. I wash mine after each use. It keeps my hands from getting brown which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly with absolutely no streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great bronzer that develops immediately and honestly has me applying it daily just to have that bronzed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT SMELL like a self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries instantly. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it staining clothes except in VERY hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mit is a little flimsy and cheap and it&#x27;s starting to fray a bit after two weeks of use. I would honestly invest in something a little more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic applicator inside the spray bottle is a little long and you do need to cut it with scissors an inch off so it fits right and closes tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in florida and you have the bronzer on, make sure you stay out of the rain and puddles... I splashed a bit of water on my legs on accident walking through a puddle and it left streak marks. They came off that night when I got home and it wasn&#x27;t permanent but that happening was not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough. I&#x27;ve been converted. No more money on spray tans. I figure that saves me $60 amonth. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing, natural looking tan. I have naturally fair skin that tans easily. Gave me the bronzed look I would get normally by laying out after several weeks. Multiple people complimented me on my skin tone/tan when I was wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively easy to apply. gloves and mitt are a must. Once i took off the gloves midway through applying, still using the mitt, and the next day, woke up with one hand bronzed.&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts several days.. I apply 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as some of the other self tanners i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t streak (as long as you rub in well) or look orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-I apply this 3 times a week, but after reaching a certain level of darkness, I&#x27;m finding it hard to get any darker.&lt;br /&gt;-If you get wet AT ALL after applying, splotches and looks like you have a skin disease. After applying, I wash my hands immediately after. Several times even the smallest droplet of water from the faucet would hit my skin, leaving a weird spot.&lt;br /&gt;-it fades poorly. I find that the crease between my forearm and upper arm (where your elbows are but facing you) started to peel/fade unevenly, which also made me look like i had a skin disease. Once this happens, it only gets worse if you try to reapply more self tanner after exfoliating like crazy. Only solution for this issue was waiting for like a week for the entire tan to come off, and starting from scratch. I also got some of this weird peeling effect on my chest area, and on the top of my feet. And i exfoliated every few days to try and make the tan fade more evenly, but it still looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;-Since it&#x27;s not a moisturizer, and i apply after getting out of the shower, made my skin dry since i couldn&#x27;t apply moisturizer after getting out of the shower like normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I like this self tanner, because of how tan it gets me. However, every so often, because of the weird and uneven peeling of the self tanner, I have to wait for a week, scrub it all off like crazy, and start over again. So i&#x27;m constantly alternating between being super bronzed looking and looking like i have a serious skin condition. I&#x27;m still going to continue to purchase it, but I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as amazing as all of the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  I love that it gives you instant color which is great if your skin has not seen any sun since last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:  The product goes on easily. I have not had any issues with the mitt and it has held up fine after numerous applications. However, like someone said before you need to rinse the mitt out.  If you don&#x27;t the coverage will look uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box includes latex gloves which I cautiously used in the beginning but found them unnecessary. With potential problem areas of the knees and elbows a LIGHT application of baby oil works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a slight scent to it.  I do not know if I would say it smells tropical to me but it is not offensive in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  It produces a nice, natural, golden tan that I get compliments on regularly. I have told a few people that my tan was \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and they are always surprised.  It looks like you just came back from a sunny vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly and I have not had any problems with the product staining or transferring on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Be careful if you wear the product out without rinsing it off first because if it gets wet, it will run.  I have had streaks on my arms due to over spray from water and the rain.  Not very attractive.  But the benefits far outweigh the one negative.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, easy application &amp; a nice color all for a good price. The only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, you have to keep re-applying it.</li>
            <li> Leaves an even tan, dries quickly, and the mit prevents streaks. Best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. I recommend starting out with a light application and adding more the next day if a darker color is desired.</li>
            <li> Perfect fake bake with out all the harm of the sun! Will be ordering this like every summer for life!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff reordered twice !</li>
            <li> Looks great but don&#x27;t go out into the rain. Shows dots!!!</li>
            <li> I blond and so have used a variety of self tanning over the years.  This has given me the best results and is the easiest to use.  Would highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan. Have spent $100 and this looks so much more real. I agree with washing mit after every use.</li>
            <li> Love the mitt - I wash it after each use so it works well each time I use it. The color guide is a nice bronze, but when it washes off, the whole tan seems to go with it. You need to apply a few coats, leave on overnight, and shower in the morning. That&#x27;s how I found it works best. Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works quick, smells great!! No streaking or orange tint!!</li>
            <li> I would like to wear shorts year-round if I could, but now that I am a senior citizen I am becoming self-conscious about the looks of my bony old legs. I have tried several drugstore tanning products and none of them compare with Fake Bake Flawless. I am very pleased with the applicator mitt, the color, the smell, and the fact there is no streaking and no orange tint. I am still experimenting with how often to reapply, but I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am pale and this gives me a nice easy tan.</li>
            <li> FASTEST WAY TO APPLY! - Exfoliate - Moisturize - Wet hands - One spray and rub hands together - Apply to a section - Repeat till all is covered  - Move quickly - Wash hands with soap! - Avoid knees, elbows, heels, toes - Repeat daily till desired color is achieved  Soooooo much faster, easier, forget the mitt, too much trouble!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best body tanner I have ever tried and I have tried a lot of different tanners. You just spray the tanner onto the provided soft mitt and rub it in. It goes on smooth and looks immediately tan. It gave me a deep summer golden glow. It was dark enough to make my pale skin look like I had been tanning for months. It fades gradually and does not wear off where my bra rubs. It is amazing! So far I am on day 5 and still look tan and dark without any noticeable fading. I am canceling my tanning membership at a local salon after discovering this product. It does a much better job than Mystic tan or any spray tans I have tried. I am so happy I found this amazing product!</li>
            <li> no streaking , no awful smell and real looking color - i am a ginger and tried every self tan product but this now the only one i will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It came way before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition! It comes with everything you need.. 2 gloves and an application mitt..I was super excited when I received this product because I was in desperate need of a tan! especially on my legs and stomach..(since they dont see the sun too often). I have never used a self tanner before and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect but I did alot of research and found this one to have the best reviews.. and the reviews were right! It is really easy to apply..very even application.. it didn&#x27;t leave me looking streaky.. and the smell was not too bad.. you definitely have to exfoliate before use and I recommend shaving right before also..I put it on right before I went to bed and then rinsed off in the morning and I loved the results!! beautiful golden tan.. i have lighter skin and it didn&#x27;t leave me looking orange.. I even did it two nights in a row to get a darker tan and loved it even more! It wears off pretty evenly and doesn&#x27;t look blotchy..I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first. I didn&#x27;t want a Dorito tan. Tried it with just rubber gloves which are included. But decided to try the mitt that was included also. Wow. So silky smooth. This mitt doesn&#x27;t allow streaks and distributed the product evenly. I love this stuff... try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a nice glow. I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued on trying this out, I happened to find this product out on amazon, by accident really, I have not seen any youtube videos or other reviews about this on blogs or anything. While I am aware that there is a big hype for this product, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that great. When I read the and reviews, my gut instinct felt it would turn out like a similar product I own, St. Moriz. and let me say, they are almost identical minus the formula which this is a spray and St. Moriz is a foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest deduct a star for me, is the fading. This stuff fades really fast. It&#x27;s been two days, and I have moisturized pretty well and my tan is way lighter than it was in the beginning. Don&#x27;t let the color guide decieve you, it&#x27;s there for a reason, so you can see where you apply the product. The bronze in the color guide is what makes you look dark initially, and then some gets washed off in the shower, making it slighly lighter looking. In comparison to different tanning formulas, specifically lotions, I find that they develop better on my skin and my golden tan stays that way for at least 5 days before I need to reaaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay, I was hoping for a burst of fruitness or something really tropical but it smelled pretty blah to me, slightly of coconut but definatley smelled like self tanner, the developing odor wasn&#x27;t that bad and it was tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the ingredients and the way it wears on my skin, it is just like St. Moriz. It dries out my skin really bad and fades way too fast. I don&#x27;t have the patchiness or lizard skin yet, cause I have been moisturizing but I know it&#x27;s gonna break apart here soon and I will not be happy. I think this tanner mostly \\&quot;stains\\&quot; your skin rather than developing it with the DHA, which is weird because DHA is high on the list of the ingredients, which is what develops your tan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the bottle leaks like crazy. THAT in itself is extremley irritating. I read reviews that you need to cut the tube and it will stop. I don&#x27;t get what that means because the leaking is coming from the base where it screws off and also the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, will continue to use lotion based self-tanners. No more sprays or foams for me!</li>
            <li> ABSOULUTLEY LOVE FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS. THE FIRST SELF TANNER I HAVE USED THAT DOES NOT STREAK OR TURN ORANGE.&lt;br /&gt;RECOMEND YOU TO TRY IT.</li>
            <li> absolutely love the color.  The scent is not bad...great going on, but next day before shower I detected some odd scent.  But so worth it!  color is very natural looking on my very pale skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and looks great right away.  Does not come off a lot on your white clothes.</li>
            <li> I am so pale and this stuff does wonders. Its so easy to apply just make sure you spray the mit not your skin.</li>
            <li> this has a great smell, looks nice, but you have to put it on every day.</li>
            <li> My boss used the lotion and it looked great.. I decided to buy the spray because I thought it would be easier to handle. I am very pale, you can see the veins through my skin... This gave me a natural looking, long lasting tan. I youtubed application techniques before I did it and it really helped me out!  Make sure your skin is exfoliated and hydrated and you will have NO issues! I can&#x27;t stop telling people about this product!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but it&#x27;s a process putting this on.  I&#x27;m never quite sure how much to spray on the mitt and it&#x27;s difficult to not get streaks when rubbing in the product.  I liken this to more of a staining tan product than the typical tanning cream product.  It gives you a pretty dark tan (I am fair skinned) right away but it&#x27;s very difficult to get it even so it looks spotty in areas.  You can definitely tell I used a tanning product.  I actually think I prefer a gradual tan.  I&#x27;ve used Jergens self tanning products in the past and think i will go back to that because it&#x27;s more gradual.  Otherwise, I think this product would be good for those who are not as fair and the difference in skin coloration wouldn&#x27;t be so noticeably dramatic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I used to use tanning beds and I quit because I pretty much had to tan everyday the color wouldn&#x27;t stay &amp; I always had to be buying expensive lotions! I was skeptical about this product since I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners &amp; they were horrible,  however this one is different.  What I love about it is that I applied it, wore my clothes and didnt stain them! I did however saw a tint on my bed sheet since is best if you put it on before you go to bed and rinse off in the morning but that&#x27;s ok, because I have a special bed sheet that protects my mattress but FYI to those that dont. The color fades off equally not leaving you spotted and when you apply it you can see the color tan your skin so you dont miss a spot the sponge is so awesome! Awesome tan no orange I have a trip to Costa Rica coming soon and I can&#x27;t wait to show off this tan at the beach will continue to order! Oh yeah and is cheaper than tanning at a tan location you save time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed. I like the original formula much better. This didn&#x27;t apply for me as well as the cream original formula.</li>
            <li> Color is good but washes off. Company says it &amp;#34;fades&amp;#34; away which is not true. Will give you color after the 4-6hr wait, rinse off color guide and you will have a nice tan that is not orange. I shower daily though since I workout daily, even with using only my hand and a gentle soap the color washes off in one to two showers. When I work out and sweat you can see the color releasing then, I did not get streaks or anything but the color did sweat off a little. Product smells good, like coconut sunscreen...until you sweat, then its nasty. Color guide does come off on clothes/sheets but washes out (even on white). Good for a days use when you wont sweat much. Not a daily item though, like fake bake sport much better.</li>
            <li> BF asked me if I&#x27;d been in the sun.  I typically use St. Tropez spray.  But love this too now.  The applicator mitt tends to soak up a lot of product, so I&#x27;d just use the plastic gloves on their own.</li>
            <li> I am completely new to bottled tan products. I didn&#x27;t really want to try any because I have seen a lot of people left with a very orange-y aftereffect. I didn&#x27;t have any problem what-so ever. I was a very porcelain pale, so I originally only did one leg to see the differences- the only big difference is I have a very natural looking tan leg and a very pale leg. So I went and did the rest of me, I  got a very even tan color by applying it in small circular motions after exfoliating like another review said to. I washed the spray off after 7 hours like the instructions said to. While the skin did lighten slightly, it was a lot darker than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this on my face, but I didn&#x27;t let it sit for 6-7 hours more like 1-2. It worked very well, but it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my legs (probably because of the time difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> It goes on so even,smooth,streak free,and amazing:)!The only downfall I hated was after awhile the mitt started to not do as well of a job applying:/that may have been my fault for rubbing in too hard.But the actual product is brilliant!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have used.  It gives a nice tan look, not orange at all.  It is noticeable, but subtle.  It goes on more like a stain than a lotion.  I like the stain better.  It is not greasy and dries a lot faster.  It doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell.  You can SEE where you are putting it to avoid streaks.  It comes with gloves and a mitt so your hands don&#x27;t get all stained.  The only downside......BEFORE you insert the sprayer into the bottle, cut about an inch off the bottom of the sprayer tube.  It is a little long and can cause oozing out of the top of the bottle.  Once I cut down the tube, this problem was solved.  I love this product.  It is easy and it looks great!  I recommend buying a balm to put on knees and elbows before using this, but it is not necessary.  I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED JUNE 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product twice this year and it was great.  The third time I used this it turned GREEN! I had a big green stripe down my leg.  I thought maybe it was the mitt, but I opened the bottle and dumped some of the solution into the sink.  THE SOLUTION TURNED GREEN! I don&#x27;t have any idea what would have caused this.  I used this product all last year, and had no problems at all.  I don&#x27;t know what the chemicals are, but something is definitely not right! I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Goes on even, nice light scent and lasts longer than others. I highly recommend fake bake to anyone. I will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product overall. It does fade after a few showers, but doesn&#x27;t look terrible like most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. I received product today and applied immediately with no problems. I&#x27;m somewhat pale, never used a self tanner in the past and had no difficulty applying this. I have had spray tans at a Spa and this is equally as nice at a fraction of the cost. Nice looking realistic tan. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner!  It is so easy to apply, and the color looks great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This product really lasts and the color is awesome.  I would definitely exfoliate before hand and do not apply lotion.  I would also make for sure to use the glove that comes with it.  I have tried every expensive brand from Sephora; Dior, Clinique, St. Tropez and this is the best one by far!</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST sunless tanner ever.  You will never buy another brand ever again!  This one totally takes the cake!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few self tanners and this one gives the most natural color of any I have ever tried. It also has the least amount of fragrance of those I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t use the mitt so it is a little messy but I just make sure to apply in shower after i dry off and then wash my hands thoroughly.  It won&#x27;t come off on clothes once you are dry. I do lotion up with Lubriderm and make sure Im dry before applying. Very nice brownish tan. Not orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and definitely not the most skilled person out there at applying tanners. I love that this one came with the mitt and gloves. I do recommend using a light hand when applying (otherwise you&#x27;ll destroy the mitt and have it&#x27;s lint all over your body). I also wash the mitt with baby soap after each use. With this you&#x27;re supposed to apply it and leave it for 5(ish) hours then rinse off (in the mean time be prepared for a STRONG sunless tanner smell and a weird brown color). Aferw rinsing, you&#x27;re left with a golden tan. I have dry skin and no matter how much or how little I exfoliate, this seems to apply and wear a little patchily. Even after trimming the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; it leaks down around the nozzle and gets everywhere. I feel like if you enjoy liquid tanners, you will enjoy this but there are easier ways to fake tan (I think I prefer lotion-based ones).</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every self tanner there is...and this by far is the best ! The smell isn&#x27;t that bad as compared to most ..the color is great.....the application process is SO easy and comes out perfect every time !&lt;br /&gt;I would defifitely do business with this vendor again....fast service !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
            <li> You have to really put it on 4 days in a row and then after sleeping with it on rinse it off , then reapply. I used a Moroccan exfoliating mitt with this and I never had any lines. The little bottle goes a long way and the gloves included help application to be flawless.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Streak free. No orange color. Love using the mitt. It helps to blend everything in reall well.</li>
            <li> looks real,no streaks,easy to apply and price was reasonable.overall great product and I have greatly recomended it to others!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I love it and so does my fiance&#x27; (he used it first). He is a ginger and is either white or red no tan ever! We did it on him for 4 days and he was very tan! He looked great and felt great. I have never sprayed anyone before and it was so easy! I even did his face neck and ears without using the cream I read about and the only part that was bad were the tops of his feet. I dont remember reading the care or washing of the mitt so I just hand washed it every other time I used it.  I used it on my legs and upper arms because of my farmers tan and I had a wedding so I had to wear a dress and I never wear shorts so my arms were very nice and tan just nothing else! So I used it for 3 days on my legs and upper arms and it looked great.  I wears off if you dont do it every few days just to maintain the color (which I didnt do) but you shouldn&#x27;t do it every day I think it said every 3-4 days? I would buy this again and my fiance&#x27; (now the tan ginger lol) LOVES IT!  I have a friend that spray tans people at a salon and she didn&#x27;t even know he was using anything untill he lifted his arm and his arm pit was white hahaha. Long story short, I would buy this again and again and the tan looks even untill about day 3 or 4 after you stop tanning when it starts to fade then you look splotchy ( for a ginger) but I really didn&#x27;t get splotchy. So good luck and happy tanning!</li>
            <li> Beyond Pleased with this product! As we all know the sun rays are dangerous to our skin with the amount of time we want to spend out in it getting dark. No more beds, no more hours in the heat, Fake Bake Flawless is the way to go. To get desired color apply multiple times through out the week until desired color is reach then just once a week for maintenance. Once your try.....you&#x27;ll never look back!</li>
            <li> For some reason, something went wrong with the shipping and I didn&#x27;t get the product at first. I emailed the seller and let her know that I hadn&#x27;t received the product and, without hesitation, she emailed me back letting me know she was sorry about the inconvenience and quickly sent a new box. I received the new package the very next day. I thought she was very courteous and I appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I love it as well! It smells amazing, gives an instant beautiful bronze to your skin and the color left behind (because,yes, a bit washes off in the shower) is beautiful as well. I apply a second coat after my shower and just get wonderful results :)</li>
            <li> this self tanner is pretty good. it leaks though if the bottle turns over and mine got knocked over and most of it spilled out. i was upset but i still got a few applicatons. the color was nice and lasted about 4 days. if you purchase make sure to set the bottle someplace it wont get knocked over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head who has had melanoma, so I use 70spf daily. I do want a little color on my legs when wearing skirts, capris, and shorts. This does the trick. It does come off onto light colored clothing, but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Like so many other reviews state, this works really well. I like the color and it usually goes on really easily.  I would recommend putting lotion on your heels and knees before applying Fake Bake.  I make sure to rinse out the applicator mitt every time I use it and hang it to dry. I have found that it works best to apply on clean skin at night and then take a shower in the morning.  It has a nice smell and is not too strong.  I am sensitive to smells and this does not bother me.  I would definitely recommend this to those of you who do not have time to lay out in the sun or do not want to spend the money going to a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Ok this is a great product.. I looked everywhere for a self tanner that is quicker ( about 10 minutes)  to put on than the lotion based ones and this was my solution. I definitely suggest showering and exfoliating/ shaving before you put this on it goes on better if you do. Also if you miss a spot or put too much on you can just spray more on or rub in the excess to blend it, making it look natural and making it easy to fix mistakes!  One major tip....After about 4 or 5 applications my mitt was getting cakey with dried tanning material so i definitely suggest either washing your mitt out every few times or buying a new one. I just hand wash mine in the sink with soap or laundry detergent and then let it dry! This bottle has lasted me a while I apply one/two times a week and I have had it for about 2 months now so to me you can&#x27;t beat it for the price and the dark brown tan! The color is a nice deep color ( Not Orange).</li>
            <li> In love with this product! I recommend it for a flawless looking tan! Not streaky at all! Go buy it!</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended to me by my nail technician. She was also a blonde hair, blue-eyed, pale girl and had a fabulous tan. I ordered Fake Bake Flawless on my phone while in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I immediately took a shower and shaved and then waited about 8 hours. While I waited I read the reviews and helpful comments here. I then YouTubed reviews and tutorials on application of this product. Each video suggested just two squirts on the upper arm, two squirts into the mitt for the lower arm, etc. I thought, \\&quot;Wow! This must be a really intense product if you need that minimal amount during the application!\\&quot; Also, this scared me into being very, very careful as I applied. I applied at night before bed and showered in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After TWO separate applications (two days apart), I was ready to give up. The product only went on semi-tan and then all washed off in the morning (no loofa, just soap on my hand). I just couldn&#x27;t believe that SO many people were raving about the amazing tan this product was giving them. Maybe I&#x27;m too pale? Maybe I messed something up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it one more shot. This time, I doused myself in the product. Directly sprayed 6 times to my upper arm, 4 to the lower, etc. Rubbed it in nicely with the mitt. I looked nice and tan! That was the first time I felt hope for this product. I went to bed that night with a tan smile on my face. When I woke up in the morning I was even tanner. I&#x27;m talking professional airbrush tan. Yay! I took a shower and yes, some of the color washed off which is to be expected. But this time there was plenty of color left. I&#x27;m not a Hawaiian looking goddess, but I look summer sun kissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably reapply again in two or three days as I have a wedding to attend this weekend, but I&#x27;m really happy with the color. Also, this product smells much better than all others and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take AwayTips:&lt;br /&gt;- Do not be afraid to apply generously... just be sure to rub in nice and evenly&lt;br /&gt;- Smell is WAY better than other products I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;- Dries super fast&lt;br /&gt;- Pale girls can look tan too!</li>
            <li> I havent had a chance to use this product yet so I do not have a bunch to say about it</li>
            <li> this was recommended by several on a message board I belong to, so I took the plunge and purchased.  It was easy to go on, and the part that i loved is that it did not have a &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34;  It did exactly what it promised and my skin was glowing for days.</li>
            <li> I tried the million dollar tan and this product to compare and this product lasted a lot longer than the million dollar tan. It was also a lot cheaper with better results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self-tan junkie and I have never found any self tanner that has worked better than this. The color is awesome, with no &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell and it looks completely natural! I use it in the winter (when I&#x27;m pasty) and in the summer when I have a tan. A must have for the all the fair people out there!</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale. This product was not for me I applied it 4 nights in a row and never much color. My legs never got much color at all. My arms where already darker and did get the most color. So it may be good for people wanting a boost to there already tan skin. The application was easy and what color I did have looked good, no streaks. Tip : Make sure to apply same amount on each leg, arm etc. I got one leg darker than the other and could not get them to even out. Just not for me. I purchased sunlabs ultra dark. I am going to try it tonight.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, will be ordering more, exactly as described, the color is gorgeous and it lasts  for a good&lt;br /&gt;week.  I spray it on the mitt then rub it onto my skin.  if you leave it on over nite, it does rub off on the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Ive really tried every self tanner, creams, gels, lotions, sprays.  This is the best.  It applies very easily and mess free.  Great instant dark color will rinse off but the self tanner base layer will stay about 5-7 days.  The best part is there is no bad self tanner smell as it develops.</li>
            <li> im in love with this stuff honestly it smells amazing, perfect color, arrived before the estimated date (pinnacle supply) will definetly buy again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve used this product for years</li>
            <li> love this! it doesn&#x27;t streak...not too orange</li>
            <li> Ordered this stuff then realized this stuff is super toxic.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/skindeep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I was over being tan and didn&#x27;t want to rub that toxic crap all over my body.  Embrace the pale!</li>
            <li> Very decent product.  And reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this item and would recommend it to anyone who needed a quick convenient tan!</li>
            <li> The color was good, but it did not go on evenly and it sunk into my pores and made them look weird.  I have never used fake tanner before so maybe I did something wrong but I followed the directions on the box.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner, ever!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It&#x27;s best to apply it after a shower before you go to bed to give it time to tan you, as the instructions say.  I use a loofah to exfoliate, put some lotion on my elbows and knees, and use the handy mitten to apply.  It&#x27;s got a tint to it so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied it, so the bronzer gives you immediate color and it keeps you from making mistakes.  The bronzer will wash off in the shower the next morning, but you still have a great color that looks like a real tan.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some tanners, and I even put this on my face.  Lasts for a few days and you can reapply as needed.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> seems to be an above-average self tanning product.....BUT STINKS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST! I typically put on my older set of sheets (nail polish stains....) when I use this. I like the mit, definitely helps to get it on evenly.  Wish wish wish IT DIDN&#x27;T STINK!</li>
            <li> Application is easy although I am weary of how long the mitt will be useful. The color is NOT dark but is also not orange,  a good light bronze color. Dries pretty quickly and also washes off pretty quickly. I would say this is good to wear if you are in a pinch and need some color for a weekend event, etc. not something to be used as a regular tanning substitute.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was back ordered but customer service was great and in contact with me. I got my product super fast once it was back in stock.i just finished using this for the first time and I have to say it smells nice it&#x27;s a tropic scent. I have had it on for about twenty minutes and there is no self tanner smell. I am not orange or streaky. I am tanner then I was and I am very white but I am not dark. I will apply it again tomorrow night and build the color. When you spray it it does splatter so lean over a towel. Overall I am happy  and love the mitt I just wish it was double sided.</li>
            <li> I used to use tanning beds to achieve my tan until one day I noticed a weird spot on my back and found out it was basal cell carcinoma. So now tanning beds are out and sunscreen is a must, but I missed having my glow. I began just trying any and every self-tanner that I could get my hands on, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with anything until I tried Fake Bake Flawless. It really has everything you hope for in a self-tanner. It really truly smells the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used (my boyfriend approves). The gloves and the mitt ensure that you wont get stained hands or streaks from application. The formula dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to waste time waiting for it dry. It has a tint to show where you&#x27;ve applied it. The color is very flattering and natural looking, I think I almost gave my dermatologist a heart attack when I went in for a check up! He was like, \\&quot;so how&#x27;s the tanning going\\&quot; and I just smiled and said, \\&quot;oh, this is fake\\&quot;, so it even fooled a dermatologist! I also love the way this one fades off very evenly to, which has been a problem with others that I have tried. I haven&#x27;t ever written one of these reviews for a product until now but I&#x27;m just so happy with this and I know how frustrating the hunt for the perfect tanner can be so I hope this helps someone else and saves them a lot of time and money spent!</li>
            <li> goes on evenly but doesnt give u as dark of a color as i would like from how lengthy a process it is to get it on ...but over all ok</li>
            <li> After watching many reviews I decided to buy this product I was skeptical at first since it was my first time tanning but I must say I absolutely love this Tanner it does exactly what it says it gives u that beautiful glowing tan I live it!</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, so most self-tanners turn me freakishly orange. This one does not do that AS BADLY, but it still appears slightly orange. It dries immediately which I love because I can put on my pajamas right after &amp; go straight to bed. Provided that you exfoliate properly before applying, the tan will last 5-7 days. The smell is great, too! The box says that it is safe to use on your face, however it broke me out... so I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face if you have sensitive skin. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self-tanner products and this one is probably the best one yet. Not only is the application easy but it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a cheeto (orange). It dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky nor did it stain my clothes afterwards. The smell at first is like coconut scent instead of that nasty self-tanner smell. However follow the directions and apply this after you shower/exfoliate/shave and at night so you can sleep on it. I applied this immediately after I exfoliated/shaved/showered/dried off and the next morning I barely saw any brown in the water during my shower. Don&#x27;t apply this during the day (or night) if you&#x27;re planning to go out. The smell is no longer like coconuts and it does start to smell SLIGHTLY like the typical self-tanner smell, especially if you sweat. The smell does go away after you wash it off though. After I washed it off the first morning, I actually reapplied it because I had plans to go out that night. But throughout the day it started to smell a little (it was hot too) so I washed it off before I went out that night. It was on my body for 6+ hours but when I washed it off there was a lot more brown in the water. So applying it before you sleep really does help the product seep into your skin and thus last longer! I reapplied this for three nights in a row and now I&#x27;m a nice tan shade. I&#x27;m going to be re-applying this every week (only once) to maintain it. So far so good! I only applied it from neck to toe. I&#x27;m not going to risk it on my face in case it accentuates any large pores. You can always use a darker foundation/bronzer on your face to even it out. Oh and it did not streak/accentuate hair follicles/pores on the rest of my body though so that&#x27;s another plus. I think this product was worth it! Cosmetic Solutions was actually out of stock when I ordered it even though it said it was in stock. So I had to wait a week longer to receive the product. I wasn&#x27;t too upset about it because they replied telling me when they would restock and shipped it immediately so I appreciate their service. Try this product out! It&#x27;s almost $30 in stores. I really like it so far.d telling me when they would restock and shipped it immediately so I appreciate their service. Try this product out! It&#x27;s almost $30 in stores. I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply spray onto your mitt, which is included in your kit, but I applied it directly to my.skin, and just rubbed on a circular motion  I felt I saved more product that way because the mitt soakes up a lot.of product,  it smell nice, tropical, not like most sunless tanners, and never streaked,  I am definately  buying this product again. I exfoliated in the shower, dryed, and applied.  The color looks so natural, but I did apply it 2 days in a row, because I wanted to have a darker color. It drys within minutes, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem finding a good self tanner because all the lotions tend to clog my pores and break me out. This stuff is great. I&#x27;m very pale (see my veins kinda pale) blonde hair. I can barely tan in the sun at all but this stuff (with just one application every couple of days) gives me a good normal looking skin tone. It does not by any means look like i just came home from a tropical vacation, but it gives my skin natural color so I don&#x27;t stand out as much in the summer. I can even put it on my face (and I do). The color guide is great for even coverage, it can be a bit harsh to walk around with though- It&#x27;s a little orange, unlike the final results once it&#x27;s washed off. I also LOVE that you can get the top of your hands which is usually a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell the mitt isn&#x27;t going to last, ill have to try to figure that one out.</li>
            <li> I just used this tonight. I am now a light golden tan. I will continue to build up the color over the next few days. This is the first self tanner that didn&#x27;t turn me into an Oompa Loompa!</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner out on the market!!  It looks natural and goes on evenly!  No streaks and no smell either!!  I would highly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the high-end self tanners out there (afraid to try drug store for fear I&#x27;d turn out orange), and for less than 1/2 the cost this is just as good.  The smell is wonderful - somewhat tropical.  By far the best smelling self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  The color is good for fall/winter.  Not too dark so that the fade isn&#x27;t so noticeable, but plenty dark for this time of year.  They make a darker version of this I will try in the spring.  I cut the straw on the spray attachment to fit the bottle before I inserted it, and I had no problems with any sort of messy application.  This tanner comes with great application gloves and a really nice mit (nicer than one I purchased at Nordstrom!!!).  I used the gloves, sprayed two sprays directly into the glove and rubbed it in.  I had no mess.  I only use the mit after applying to smooth around ankles and elbows, because I feel like mits end up rubbing off 1/2 of your self tanner and you are never as dark when you use them.  The result was streak free and very pretty.  Buy this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is the best!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff is the real deal.  I will absolutely re-order</li>
            <li> I love it I even put it on the mit then on my face it&#x27;s great color first I put on lotion on my face then 3 Sparys of the tanner it gives my body a nice glow and smells like coconuts yummy</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Looks really natural.  It&#x27;s a nice brown tan as opposed to the orange you get from other fake tanners.  Smells good, also.  The downside is that it just doesn&#x27;t last.  Every 2 days you have to reapply.  And you&#x27;ll most certainly need the face tanner for your face.  Overall though, it&#x27;s a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> beautiful colour, blends easily. great smell</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li> Excellent product: quick, natural looking color that doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes! Goes on quickly and easily with the mitt and you can see it immediately. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the color it gives you, but it seems to wash off, so you have to put it on everyday....</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m pretty Irish, and Fake Bake Flawless gives me just the right amount of tan that looks natural and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost. I was hesitant at first since self tanner is a scary thing, but it really did go on flawlessly and looked totally natural. People complimented my tan and had no idea it was fake. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product came with a mitt, also loved that it was in spray form because it dries super fast. There&#x27;s no foul smell when you first put it on but when you wake up the next day you can definitely smell the fake tanner smell. I wanted to like this product, but unfortunately it turned me orange. I&#x27;m continuing my search.</li>
            <li> It works no better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used before.  It still makes you orange.</li>
            <li> The best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. I love the mitt it comes with. The tanning spray smells good but not strong at all which is great. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it isn&#x27;t that dark unless you apply it at least twice within 24 hours  but again the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Luved it. Ordered more</li>
            <li> Tan barely shows up and washes off almost completely the next day. You need to apply it daily to have any sort of tan. It is almost like a bronzer instead of a sunless tanner. The minimal tan it does gives fades within a few days. Not a good product. My least favorite tanner.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product from Amazon, but I felt that since I do buy a lot on this site I would like to warn people. I bought this product last year in the summer, and it worked really well, but you had to be sure diligent on application. I went to use it again yesterday, and the product had turned green. It was kept under my sink, where it is dark and room temp, but it was completely unusable. All other sunless tanning products I have ever purchased have lasted for years. Will never buy this product again!!!!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used. This is my second time buying this product thru Amazon. Very easy application and nice scent. Natural tan instantly!</li>
            <li> I love the mitt and the ease of application. It worked well without leaving me orange. I have only used it once so don&#x27;t know if next time I will be darker but the first application didn&#x27;t leave me very dark. Maybe its more of a gradual tan? No funky lines though so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanners, but Fake Bake is by far the best!  Because it&#x27;s tinted, it was easy to apply evenly, and it dried quickly - no staining clothes or sheets.  The tropical, coconutty scent was pleasant.  The color was very natural looking - just dark enough.  It was great finding a product that lived up to its promises.  The affordable price was also a plus.  I ordered mine with Amazon Prime, so there was no shipping cost.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked at a tanning salon and gotten free mystic sprays for the past 6 months.  Not only does this color look very comparable, but it&#x27;s much easier to control and less likely to get random brown spots on hands and feet.  The mitten is genius, you just buff the color on.  It&#x27;s not super greasy.  The whole process took less time than it would have taken to drive to the tanning salon and get a spray tan, and I did it in the comfort of my own home.  :)  Oh and I like this much more compared to aerosol sprays because you have to be so careful not to spray them all over the walls.  This pump is much easier.  It&#x27;s also significantly easier than lotion to rub into the skin without streaks.  Smells great (DHA always has a distinct smell after it develops, but the smell is tropical until then).  I don&#x27;t know what the people with bad reviews did wrong, but there&#x27;s a reason that almost 2,000 reviews still give this product almost 5 stars.  TIP** I read a review about cutting the pump to fit the bottle before use.  DEFINITELY do this.  It&#x27;s way too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Let me start with details about myself. I am a 34 year old female with fair skin. I used tanning beds unit I learned their dangers. Then I used the spray tan booths at the tanning salon. I moved far out of town and couldn&#x27;t get a salon tan any more. So I ordered Fake Bake after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on Friday and it was delivered that SUNDAY. One day early too. I tried it that night. It&#x27;s easy to apply, there is a brown tint added to the liquid to help see where you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it looks 10 times better than a salon tan. No streaks, orange color or getting naked in a strip mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like a salon tan with tint added, you will need to rinse it off before you go out. I suggest applying it at night and washing the tint off in the morning. Do not apply and go in the rain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how the mit started to leave lint all over and began falling apart. The instructions say to use light circles but I have a habit of using pressure when I apply it.</li>
            <li> This product really can be applied flawlessly. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have always struggled getting a natural looking glow and not turning out looking like a tiger striped Dorito. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it&#x27;s the second time in my life I use a tanner in spray, the first experience wasn&#x27;t good (another brand), I finished with a carrot color that wasn&#x27;t natural at all. With this product the results are incredible well and very easy to use and to spread on the body using the gloves that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Best fake tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! Super natural and subtle, and no streaks whatsoever. And it is so easy to apply. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone. I even use it on my face with no problems with clogged pores or streaks - just use the brown side of the mitt and one or two sprays. It&#x27;s a little unclear what side of the mitt you&#x27;re supposed to use for what, but I just use the dark (soft) side for everything. I also apply a body butter to my wrists, elbows, knees and ankles before applying the tanner. Finally, when I&#x27;m all done, I apply the body butter to my hands, spray the tanner onto the mitt, and rub it into the tops of my hands. A lot of the color will come off in the shower (you will probably be about half as tan after showering), so you might want to apply two coats if you want a darker tan and don&#x27;t be afraid of the color you develop because it will fade a lot in the first shower. However, this is just the color guard and the actual tan does not fade quickly in subsequent showers. I think my tan lasts about a week. I&#x27;ve been reapplying every 1 or 1.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not too much color once you shower but still a pretty glow. It was a perfect way to get some color while pregnant.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! it works terrific! i would recommend it to anyone.. I was pregnant in the winter months so never got any sun, and used this very regularly. very natural looking</li>
            <li> This worked good in the beginning now it makes my face look dirty and when I applied lighter you can&#x27;t see it at all.</li>
            <li> So, I have tried many self tanners over the years. I would think they looked great but after about a week I could see it wearing off it spots leaving an orangey, mottled appearance. Then I observed my hairdresser with a lovely golden glow. I asked her how she got that awesome tan, she told me &amp;#34;Fake Bake Flawless&amp;#34;. She also told me that she picked it up at a professioanal trade show and that it was not available to the general public!!!! Sorry, Lauen. I found it on Amazon. So, I decided to try Fake Bake Flawless - guess what? NO MORE ORANGE LEOPARD SKIN!!!! I now have a gorgeous golden tan, too.</li>
            <li> Works great! Not orange or flakey. Wonderful product. Oh and the mitt is borderline genius.</li>
            <li> I started self tanning after years of laying in the sun. I am only 17 years old and have already had skin cancer scares. My grandma used to make me lay out to get tan which caused a TON of moles to cover my back. I love the way I look when I&#x27;m tan but I realize that tanning beds and laying outside IS NOT WORTH IT! I started using this product a year ago and fell in love! I love the color, the smell, and easy application! I am SUPER pale and it gives me a nice natural tan without all of the damage. I would ddeffiantly recommend this to someone looking for a safer alternative.</li>
            <li> Its ok ,doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not for me.  When I apply fake tan I would like for it to last a few days &amp; I have products that do that for me.  This just sounded easy &amp; good so thought I would give it a try.  It is easy &amp; if you just want a tan until you take a shower it would be great for you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sunless tanning product! Will definitely be purchasing more once mine is all gone! Thank you so much for a great transaction and great quality product.</li>
            <li> I have tried practically every self tanner made and have also had spray-on tanning done in salons.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  This is by far the easiest of them all to apply with the mitt.  The color is the most natural and the mitt helps you get the most even application you can ask for from a self tanner.  Remember, some color will wash down the drain when you next shower, but if you&#x27;re not as dark as you&#x27;d like, reapply the next night.  A couple hours before bed, shower and shave and use a rough exfoliating glove to remove surface dead skin.  I also lightly apply an \\&quot;in shower\\&quot; body lotion or oil such as Alph Keri and gently rinse off.  This keeps the product from collecting on any rough patches, elbows and knees.  Dry off and air dry a couple minutes.  Apply the product using the mitt with circular motions.   I cover up in a light  lose sarong for an hour or two so that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s dry.  I put on silky pj&#x27;s and go to bed.  Next morning, shower, apply body lotion and go to work.  Not perfect, but as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used. Color is awesome and it stays on without rubbing off when wearing shoes.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I tested it out on my stomach and it dried quickly I did everything correctly. Well, I wore a tan shirt, and well...there were blotches of pink on my shirt.</li>
            <li> It works as it says it does. I am just not one for fake tanning products. I did like the way it made my skin look. It is a must that you follow all directions.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply because you can see it when you apply it. It looks natural not orange like all the other self tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like tanning booths, or some of the other self tanning products with that terrible smell that lingers for days.. This one gives you an instant tan, very real looking. Make sure you exfoliate your body to get rid of dry spots, and you&#x27;ll be looking beach ready!</li>
            <li> Have been using FakeBake products for years.  Very happy with the color and ease of use.  Prefer this to the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best, easiest, most real looking tan in a bottle....just fades after a shower but the longer you leave it on, at least 8 hours, the darker it will be. You can apply it two or three days in a row for better results!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great self tanner. The first time you use it, if you&#x27;re pale like me, may not be enough. I&#x27;ve used this product once already and only noticed a slight tan. The smell is amazing at first but changes after a few hours to a smell that it not so great. But if you apply this at night before you go to bed it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I read reviews and cut the tube before putting it in the bottle and no product leaked. One thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this self tanner was some parts of my body were unevenly tanned but then again, I have some tan lines and I was applying it quickly. My suggestions would be to definitely do it a night, exfoliate before applying, and mostly importantly, take your time when applying this. I was rushing and forgot to do the tops of my hands so now there is a line in my wrist area.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this product again and I can&#x27;t wait to use it when I&#x27;m going on my cruise in the winter.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried in a long time! So natural!</li>
            <li> Worked just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Ulta sells this set for 30$ &amp; it comes with a compact face bronzer w. Brush. Best bronzer &amp; i loved the face bronzer as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite fake bake. Follow the direction and works like a charm</li>
            <li> There are not enough good things I could say about this product!!!! Smells amazing. Dries super fast. Leaves no streaks. EVER. My tan always looks like a real tan. My feet and hands look great and I never get that yucky fake tanner line around my wrists. I recommend everyone who likes self tanning try this. I&#x27;d give this 10 stars + if I could.</li>
            <li> I live this product. It gives a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; tan. I advise washing the mug frequently, otherwise you will turn green lol</li>
            <li> when you first start using this product, you need to put it on every time after you shower. A large portion of it does wash off every time you shower but if you keep using it daily you will get the color you are desiring and then you can start using it every other day. Works well if you use it right! Ohh, and the tan does look real! no streaks. I used it during the wintertime (I live in North Idaho) and people were baffled and jealous of my tan :p</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used! I love the mitt that comes with it because it really provides a smooth application, not to mention it really cut down on the amount of time that it took me to apply. My tan was very even and natural. The smell is pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li> I love the color payoff with this product, especially if I use it two days in a row!. Beautiful bronze -y skin and it Maes me feel radiant. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products (I still LOVE million dollar tan) but for the price, you really just can&#x27;t beat this bottle....I use jergens  natural glow to spruce up my tan about mid-week (just on my legs as this part always seems to take less color) and my tan lasts normally five to seven days before I actually b do the whole process again. I use a sigma f80 brush after I have applied moisturizer to spread it on my face/neck/ears area and it eliminates the need completely for a separate face tanner!.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can see from my photo my feet are the color that my legs were. I only do my feet every other time I use this since I can get them to naturally tan faster than my legs. This product is great. It works almost instantly unlike other lotions that take two weeks to build up! I haven&#x27;t seen much sun in a year so I&#x27;ve been very pale when I&#x27;m used to being tan. If you want this to look good you should expect to take your time applying it. I followed another reviewers advice and exfoliated, put some lotion on, let it dry, then apply the product. The first time I did it very lightly since I was new to it. It&#x27;s only been 5 days and it looks like I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while. If certain spots look a little thicker, the residual product washes off in the shower so it looks smooth. Again, take your time applying section by section in a circular motion. Was the glove after every use too.</li>
            <li> Low low price. Love the product. My summer must have. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As long as you moisturize well beforehand, this self tanner will apply so smoothly and it will last for days! The mitt is very nice to have too, as gloves can be hard to work with...especially if you have hairy arms. The best time to use this self tanner is after exfoliating your skin when the pores are open. Don&#x27;t worry about it staining your clothes either, it won&#x27;t because it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a tan without going to the tanning bed.  Didn&#x27;t streak or make me look orange.  Will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the color, does not turn me orange!!! Stays on for about 4 days. Do NOT shower or get water on yourself at all within 24 hours of application. It will start to run and fade if you get caught in the rain. The 4 stars was for the mitt. I think is poor quality and slips off your hand during application. I tried it on my face and it broke me out, I have very sensitive acne prone skin. SHAVE THE DAY BEFORE It sunk into the pores of my legs I guess because I used immediately after shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I think it lasts like two days on me, but I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> This works great and I would highly recommend it. Easy to apply with no streaking, just spray it on and wipe it around as evenly as you can. The result is a nice even bronze color. It gives a great looking tan in no time and the low price is excellent. I can&#x27;t imagine there is a similar product that works any better. I don&#x27;t use the included blue gloves, and really don&#x27;t think they are necessary. I&#x27;ve applied it by spraying it directly on the skin and by spraying it on the glove... either way works great. The bottle lasts awhile too, longer than I expected it would. This is much more convenient and safer than laying in the sun or a tanning bed. After not using it for two days a green ring appeared on the brown mitt and it kind of freaked me out. I read online that it was just part of the color left behind on the mitt as it dried/aired out, it was not an issue. I do not have any issues to report... this is 100% an all around great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it does, considering the price. The glove is kind of a joke, and a hassle having to wear another glove underneath, but the color is pretty good, doesn&#x27;t stink too bad, not too much color, lasts a good amount of time. Only thing is that if you don&#x27;t exfoliate everyday it&#x27;ll build up in some spots and then rub off in the shower or while exercising and stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is just like its name, flawless. It takes me five minutes to apply this to my whole body using the buffing mitt and it is streak free! It gives you some immediate color which is good for seeing where you are working and buffing out any lines not to mention if you are putting it on right before going out you get some immediate color. I usually apply this two days in a row and then I have enough color and just once a week after that. Its the best product Ive found and Ive tried a lot! The others were aerosole and made a complete mess out of my entire bathroom, and the lotions I was more likely to get streaks or my palms and in between fingers all stained. You wont regret this product! And the seller I bought from was such a great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The color this produces is great (very natural).  I likely the mit, although it is a bit small and gets a little gross after multiple uses.  I have purchased a reusable mit from a different company but will cont to purchase this self tanner to use with it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no streaks and the smell is not as unpleasant as most self tanners.  I was not that impressed with the color though, I have a medium skin tone and I thought the color had a tint of orange to it.  Not too bad though.  It also makes a huge mess and I had to scrub my bathroom after.  I&#x27;ll stick to st.tropez.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I found this sooner. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or streaky, and looks very natural. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. It really is so much better than spending so much time in tanning beds and risking skin cancer. I put it on at bedtime and wake up beautifully  bronzed. I only applied 2 nights in a row and I already have good color. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I usually use the non-spray, and use the gloves and rub it on...I thought Id try this one, it was a little more expensive (not by much) and it had a mitt, interesting right? The first time I put it on, it went on great, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;, waited about 5 to 6 days and it was coming off, I started looking like the pale self again, just like the other &amp;#34;fake bake products&amp;#34;, I put it on after that amount of days and this would not go on, like only certain parts on the skin. It was frustrating, and what I figured out, was it would only go on the parts of my skin that the old stuff wasn&#x27;t on at all. I had to totally exfoliate my skin, rub (till my skin was red) all the old fake bake off, until , without a doubt, there was not one stream of the time before application. I know it is a good thing to exfoliate your skin before you put this on, but with the other non-sprays, I only exfoliated every month, and I was good to go with each application. It could be that I did not properly put it on, I don&#x27;t know but if it takes that much direction, Id rather just pay way less and get non-spray fake bake, I&#x27;m a total believer in fake bake, just not the spray unit.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and have recently quit going to the tanning beds to save my skin. Even the high pressure beds with only UV-A rays are still damaging. While testing self-tanning products I discovered this on amazon. So glad I tried it! This truly can compete with the best tanning beds I have found. And I live in the LA area so we have many options!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam mitt makes application a cinch. No staining on my hands or fingers. I also wear latex gloves each time I apply. I have them for other purposes since I tint &amp; highlight my own hair. You can get a box of gloves for under $10 here or at a beauty supply. My husband helps me with my shoulder blades, center of my back plus my lower-middle back. He doesn&#x27;t use any rubber gloves under the mit and doesn&#x27;t ever have a problem with staining. Also his part takes less than 60 seconds. The dark side of the application mit kind of holds the product and it doesn&#x27;t come through onto your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Wash the app. mitt each time you tan to save the life of it, also seems like it could get crusty if you didn&#x27;t wash it&lt;br /&gt;Bend elbows and knees, tan over them quickly and smoothly -careful not to have a full mit of product when you touch these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application takes less than 5 minutes and it dries really fast. Plus it smells great. And I sleep in it. I have red sheets and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bleeding or staining.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments all the time on my skin and my even tan. There is no orange what so ever. Just a natural looking California-tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also recommend &#x60;Fake Bake Face&#x27; as a companion product. It doesn&#x27;t fill your pores with color like some self-tanners do on your face!</li>
            <li> its a little scary trying a tanner the first time but you can&#x27;t mess this up! Follow the instructions and BAM - a pretty tan that lasts ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very pale skin, and for me.... this stuff turned me an odd color. I expected an odd color at first because of the color guide, but after washing it off the next morning, my skin was still an odd color. It wasn&#x27;t that bright orange that some tanners have turned me, but it was still orangey and not a pretty color. To makes matters worse, every hair follicle was clearly darker than the rest of my skin. It looked as if I had some horrible skin disease. The color actually improved a bit as it started washing away 2 and 3 days after application, but I still appeared spotted. The only good note I have about the color is that there were no streaks, and it was even.   Application was certainly much easier than any other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried, so that&#x27;s a plus. I allowed the color to sit for a couple hours before going to bed, but it still stained my bedsheets; it washed out fine, but I&#x27;d suggest putting something over your sheets just in case.   To be fair, I tried this stuff 4-5 times and always got the same, not-so-great results. It may work for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I thought it was tedious to have to spray the mit, then rub the stuff in with the mit, yada yada. I had been using the Fake Bake spray, and it is quick and fast and did a good job, but makes a huge mess in my bathroom, which is why I decided to try the Flawless. So the Flawless takes more effort, but it also works better. With the spray, no matter how I did it, my legs would never really get fully tan looking. They would look streaky or darker in spots. It usually worked out fine, and you couldn&#x27;t really tell and I am sure no one is staring at my legs anyhow. However after using this stuff, I have to say that I think it works better than the spray, and much better than anything I had used before as well. I would recommend it, especially for first time self tanner users, because it is tinted and so you can see where you have already applied it. Just be careful doing your hands- keep your fingers bent, so that you don&#x27;t get lines in your knuckles, and same thing with elbows and knees- keep them bent. And go easy around the feet.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, tan is very natural.  The mitt is great, but I found it works better when I spray the mitt first and then apply.  Less mess and more even tan.</li>
            <li> Luv this product.  Easy to see where it is applied, nice coconut smell, great color that lasts about a week with light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 yrs now, and always get asked if I&#x27;ve taken a vacay somewhere with a beach.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single product out there for creating a fake tan, and this stuff is by far the best.  I have fairly light skin.  I tan, but it takes a long time, and I never get very tan unless I spend a ton of time in the sun (which I refuse to do).  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the mitt that comes with this stuff to make for a smooth application, or if it&#x27;s the product or both, but the color is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t smell chemically after it&#x27;s dried (no smell at all), and it&#x27;s not streaky!  I don&#x27;t have spots that have less color than others (which I had no matter how carefully I applied other stuff).  I got the tan I wanted in 2 applications.  I hope the instructions are accurate because it says I only have to apply once a week to keep this tan.  This bottle will last a long time if that&#x27;s true.  And the best part is you don&#x27;t get any of the stuff on your palms, so there&#x27;s no washing up afterwards (or forgetting to wash up and having tanned palms!).</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. The color looks so real and stays for long. I apply once a week and I&#x27;m set. I also use it on my face. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing! I love the color and ease that it goes on. I do wish the mitten was easier to hang on to with a gloved hand, but still....awesome! Don&#x27;t freak out when you look in the mirror at your face and see how dark it is. Some of the color will rinse/wash off. But, there is still a nice tan on your skin. VERY natural looking!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am naturally pale and it is impossible for my to build a tan! This product works great! It drys super fast! I apply it twice a week to keep a constant color!</li>
            <li> This self tanner is about the same price as the spray-on ones in Walmart, but it works SO much better! It got me way darker, and wasn&#x27;t orange-colored at all! I&#x27;ll definitely be using this product from now on! A piece of advice though, make sure you use the mitt that they provide. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with a very stained hand.</li>
            <li> Loved at first. Started to not look the same. The smell started to annoy me too. Over powered my perfume.</li>
            <li> The salon that I go to sells this and all the girls rave about it. I really wanted to try it, but they were selling it for almost $30. I found it here on Amazon for a lot cheaper. So I figured I&#x27;d might as well try it.     I really like it. It leaves me with a beautiful subtle color.     I was really worried at first because it goes on really dark. But I left it on for 6 hours than took a shower and all of the dark washed off leaving me with a great color.   It has been 3 days and my color still looks great.     The only problems I really had was it came off the tops of my feet a little bit and the mit that comes with it for application kind of sheds a little. But other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Wow, this updated product is even better, and I thought it was GREAT already!  Smells like coconut, not like other tanning cream or sprays which smell odd.  It is easier to use with the pad and covers more area with the use of the pad.  It stays on well and gives super white people like me a natural tan.  Am going to use all the time</li>
            <li> It works okay... wouldnt say that it is an immediate tan, not like actually going and getting a spray tan. I had to use it a couple of times to actually look tan. But its worth the money with the gloves and everything.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s amazing! I am very pale and i applied one coat and instantly looked tan and not orange whatsoever! The elbows and hands are difficult areas to apply tanners and this product is no different... although it did start to look better after a couple of showers. Overall an excellent product for those of us who don&#x27;t like tanning beds and want a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> I just bought this spray Fake Bake. This is such a fantastic tanning product. NO orange, NO streaking, go as dark as you like, doesn&#x27;t wash off for several days, smells great and I consider the price very very reasonable. Talk about an instant flawless tan in seconds. I have very pale skin that only burns in the sun. So my vacations are spent using the highest number sun block every time and no tan. Now I no longer blend in with my white shorts and capri&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Best self tan I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve always has streaks with all the other brands I&#x27;ve used, but not with this fake bake, it&#x27;s amazing, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used several self tanners before but this one is my favorite. I&#x27;m a lazy tanner. I don&#x27;t always exfoliate, lotion up, etc...and this product was pretty forgiving considering my hap hazard application process. Even though I&#x27;m not very precise and was in a big hurry to be done with the process I ended up with a even and natural looking tan. I like that the product doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner smell that other products reek of. I also like that they don&#x27;t load the product with flowery scents. You barely smell anything and I didn&#x27;t notice any color transfer to my clothing. All in all I was very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I&#x27;ve used so far. The only downside is it&#x27;s really intense, and easy to mess up. There is a right &amp; wrong way to do it... I get the best results when I exfoliate for a few days before using it &amp; the day of, then use it after taking a shower in the evening &amp; putting on NO lotions or anything [except for a little argan oil or something like that on my elbows, knees, ankles and face]. I would never go out in public directly after applying it, it gets SUPER dark and SUPER intense brown/orange right away, so I go to bed like 30 minutes after applying it, let it deepen overnight, and then when I wash it off in the shower it looks amazing like a real tan! Just be careful not to rub your face, especially around the mouth area. I gave myself a five o&#x27; clock shadow the first time I used it lol. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty great product &amp; I&#x27;ll be using this for a while.</li>
            <li> Looks natural!! Nice, brown even color!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Goes on very even, dries in seconds with no residue, shows where color has been applied, and looks natural! Color builds gradually, which in my opinion is good, because if you do goof up, it won&#x27;t stand out. Also, did not break out my super sensitive skin!  Awesome, will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love it! As expected!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get away from tanning beds but stay tan and this stuff does the trick. Doesn&#x27;t make me orange and dries really fast. I love it. Got shipped to me quickly and I have NO complaints whatsoever. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak.. I&#x27;ve done it everyday for almost two years now and have tried just about every product there is. This is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve found (that is self aplicable).I have been using it with a great vitamin skin serum .  I have found that combining this mask with [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 25% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid]]and my skin is absolutely amazing!  I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove. Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground. It&#x27;s soooo good though... gets me so dark and lasts FOREVER! Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I usually use St. Tropez self tanner, it&#x27;s a bit pricy and I&#x27;m on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;I was reading reviews and decided to purchase this item on Amazon. I absolutely love it, this is a great back up option and it&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on really dark so it&#x27;s easier to see. At first it will seem unnaturally dark but that&#x27;s the initial color. Once it is washed off you will have a nice natural bronze that doesn&#x27;t look orange! Which was a huge deal for me. Purchase this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Goes on really well and leaves a nice color. Just doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like. However, I&#x27;d buy it again! Much safer than the bed, less annoying than the spray tan at the salon (and cheaper).</li>
            <li> this one is the best smells like coconut. last 7 days</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I want to stop tanning in tanning beds. I already have a base tan might I add. It goes on very easy, blends amazingly well and dries really fast. It smells good too. I don&#x27;t notice the \\&quot;DHA\\&quot; smell or whatever (the chemical smell) other reviewers notice hours after it&#x27;s applied. I don&#x27;t notice any smell a few hours later at all actually. Color does wash off when you shower, which is why I apply it before bed and shower in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t come off too bad for me, of course I have a base tan. I think if you&#x27;re looking at this product to buy, you should do it. Just blend it in very well and DO NOT RUSH THE PROCESS. Totally worth the money and i&#x27;m definitely going to be buying again. I only wish it came in a bigger size! This product will replace the tanning bed for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT****&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have gone through more than one application before writing my review. I just did my second application this morning and I do not think I will actually buy this again. I think I might just actually use the tanning bed :/. It high lights all of your pores, it streaks a little bit, and the worst part for me, on my fore arms/upper arms it doesnt blend at a certain area, nor does it darken the underside of my arm any, no matter how much I put on. I&#x27;ll be spending my in the shower trying to scrub this off.</li>
            <li> I have been through tons of self tanners and none compare to this it gives great color and even after 3 days the tan still looks natural it is not orange at all!  I am a fair to medium skin tone with blue eyes and light brown hair and i looked like i had a natural tan. I have been asked by many of my co workers what i use and they are now going to purchase this product! Anyone who is thinking about buying this, i suggest you do you will be shocked how great the results are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist and know quality products when I use them. This product is better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever have had. It applies better, smells better, drys better and lasts longer at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m thinking people who say it&#x27;s orange are using too much and not spreading it well. This is amazing and I was referred to use this by a pageant girl who models for Modern Vintage Boutique. She is stunning. Check out her skin!</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old female. I have been using fake tanner since high school. I have tried several brands, types, and application types. I really like this product. My fav so far is St Tropez, but it can be expensive. I found this product to be super easy to apply with the mitt. I also found there to be little to no smell as it develops- which is awesome! I love that it is a pump spray. I read other reviews and trimmed the straw part of the pump a little bc it was slightly long. I spray directly onto the mitt and apply. Quickest apply time of any that I have used. In my opinion, perfect for legs. I often just apply to my lower half bc I tend to get more sun on my arms and face. Very happy with this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this stuff and so is my husband! I bought it without telling him and it came a week before the anticipated arrival! So I was caught and had to tell him what it was haha as soon as we got home from running errands he was first to strip down and demand I spray him down! When we were done he immediately told me to order more because we would need it! We planned on going tanning but I worry about the consequences of using tanning beds! We both look great! It is a nice golden brown tan! We will be purchasing again tonight! And the best part for me, they don&#x27;t test on animals!!!</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin has a nice golden glow! The mitt makes it super easy to apply and with no streaks! Great scent as well! I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great !!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, however it does leave me a little bit orange at times. However I am very pale</li>
            <li> It really works! No orange it&#x27;s AWESOME. Easy and fast.</li>
            <li> I will never go to a spray tan place again! Soooooo much better and EVEN!!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy application, great scent!  I will never pay for another spray tan!</li>
            <li> Everything it claims is true EXCEPT it is transferable. Smells nice, good color but my bedding is stained from it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference when I used this product. Applied more than once also just to be sure I was applying correctly and it wasn&#x27;t a gradual process. Will go back to using the body drench brand.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for my pasty skin. It&#x27;s tan rather than orange! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use... I sprayed it onto the mitt, then rubbed it into my skin. Color was great and instant! Definately recommend getting!</li>
            <li> Creates a gorgeous all-over body tan that looks natural and not orange!</li>
            <li> Great color with no streaking.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I am a VERY pale woman who has tried many different self-tanners. This is the best one! No streaking and a very natural brown (not orange!) color. I recommend it to everyone who asks if I just came back from vacation. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Great color w no nasty smell</li>
            <li> This self tanner is the best one I have tried! It smells great, dries quickly and evenly and leaves you with this wonderful, natural tan. I love this product so much and already have two of my friends hooked on it with I&#x27;m sure more to come. Excellent product and I highly recommend it as a must try! Its a win-win with a great price to boot!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! This provided me with an instant golden brown tan, it was easy to apply, very little odor, dries quickly &amp; lasts a few days! I have very light skin &amp; when I put this on, it looked like I had just come back from Hawaii- in fact, my husband even complemented me on how great I looked &amp; that doesn&#x27;t happen often ;) he also said he noticed that I had been losing more weight! (Being tan helps give the appearance of taking pounds off). I bought this for an upcoming trip to Palm Springs &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have found that it is the best self tanner I have ever used! I&#x27;ll be recommending it to all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this tanner. The mitt that&#x27;s included makes the application easy. Natural looking tan too. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love this. Goes on evenly without streaking and a very natural brown vs orange like some others. It is very dark, though. If you are very fair I&#x27;m not sure how it would look. It does look good on my medium skin tone, though. It also lasts several applications.</li>
            <li> I love that you can see the color right away. BUT it last only about 2 days for me. Wish the color lasted longer. Also wished they sold a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I ever used. It dries right away which is great for me because I am a not good a using sunless tanning products, I always rush and want to get dressed right away so it comes out streaky. I have pretty light skin and it does not look orange at all. It is SO EASY to use. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. Put it on in the evening before bed then shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This stuff fades so evenly! No spots at all! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great, and quickly dries. The tan (if it&#x27;s evenly distributed..) looks SO natural.&lt;br /&gt; The mitt&#x27;s gotta go though! That thing is so hard to hold on to, especially while you have the rubber gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it leaves little brown lint balls all stuck to your freshly applied lotion.</li>
            <li> One of the best fake tanners out there and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have very fair skin and i got an actual tan from this. Not orange, not bronze,,,Tan!! :) I will defiently be getting more</li>
            <li> Works great. No streaks. Natural tan look.</li>
            <li> I am on my second night of this. I was very white so color showed up quick this morning.  I actually don&#x27;t want to get much darker than maybe after tonight&#x27;s application. I have to say I am impressed. Everything I have ever used has turned me orange and has streaked. I did put more on my left leg than right, because it was darker. Too afraid to try my face just yet. Are you supposed to wash the MIT every time you use it?</li>
            <li> It looked natural and was easy to apply. It dried quickly. I put it on a couple of days in a row to get the desired deepness of the tan. It stayed on for about a week. Great stuff. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times, and it is the best! It even looks good on my feet, and that to me, is the hardest area to make look natural! I even love the smell, and it is fun putting it on! The plastic gloves are well made as well! I already have somewhat tanned skin, and this deepens it for me. It is so fun waking up in the morning and looking all bronzed and brown! And I have sensitive acne prone skin, and I have not broke out from this! I will def keep this on hamd!</li>
            <li> Im going to a wedding this weekend and i wanted to get a spray tan, but i was scared of turning orange or some odd color, so i saw this product and decided to give it a try.....IT WORKED, I LOVE IT!!!! BUY THIS!...It is literally the BEST self tanning product EVER. I got tan over night!!! Easy application, no orange tan results!  ITS PERFECT. I got 2 more boxes of this tanning product waiting to be bought in my cart right now, thats how much I LOVE IT!!! THANK YOU FAKE BAKE!!! :)</li>
            <li> Better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve used! I love that you can see the product as your putting it on! No uneven lines popping up hours later;)</li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended on youtube by some trusted beauty gurus  and they were right - the color is awesome and the idea of using a mitt and protective rubber gloves really makes self tanning easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color is believable (I&#x27;m medium skin tone with olive undertones).&lt;br /&gt;i liked that unlike the lotions or mousse i have used (st tropez and xen tan) it was much less scented and dried super fast - like, 3 minutes fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the mitt/gloves concept is great BUT there might be better mitts out there and you can buy hospital gloves on the cheap at other stores, im sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my mitt \\&quot;shed\\&quot; a bit. ok, a lot. the first time i used it and that happened i messaged the youtube guru who recommended the product and she suggested washing it. i tried that (by hand, of course) and yet it still shed the second time  - although much less this time (thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if the mitt didn&#x27;t flake/shed (like, little pillings off of the mitt/left on your skin) it would be PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to try this product from all the rave reviews and the inexpensive price. As a novice to self tanner, I was trying to prepare myself by watching tutorials on youtube for this product and the people made it look so effortless but let me just say it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to apply this product. The &#x27;professional&#x27; mitt that it comes with starts flaking/shedding within a couple uses. This is probably because of how hard I&#x27;m pressing this over my skin and you really have to apply pressure because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up streaky because this product dries incredibly fast. Fast, I mean like in 15 seconds fast. I&#x27;ve applied this on my face too by just mixing three squirts of the tanner into a sufficient amount of facial moisturizer to cover my face and it comes out with an even color. The color isn&#x27;t orangey, but it does come out patchy in a lot of places due to the contours of your body and the fast drying time. But it is worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and fair skinned.  Over the years I have use many many different brands of self tanners on the quest not to look orange or have the product sink into my pores after shaving my legs!  I have also found that most self tanners cause me to break out if used on my face.  For the past several years I have been using Clarins Self Tanning Gel which had been my gold standard.  I must say, Fake Bake gave me better color and I was even able to apply it to my feet and still look like a natural tan.  It is true, as others have said, that when you shower after application (I apply before bed and shower in the morning) you do lose some of the color initially, but once you have achieved your desired shade that is no longer a problem because the tan lasts for several days.  It is only after application that you see that initial tinge going down the shower drain but you are still left with beautiful color.  I have even used it on my face with no problems breaking out. In my opinion the key to the even look of the tan is to use the mitt that is included.  Although, I am sure I am losing some of the product to absorbtion into the mitt.  The results make it totally worth it.  I will buy this product again and again this summer!  This is surely my new \\&quot;gold standard!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i buy this again and again.  it is the best self tanning product on the market.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the actual Fake Bake mitt with this kit. It came with a pink applicator that sheaded when I used it. I would probably buy the kit in stores.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results. I can&#x27;t tan in the sun, and I need some color for my wedding and this doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. I put it on at night after a shower and a little rubs off on my sheets, but not anything that can&#x27;t be washed out. More importantly it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes the next day</li>
            <li> Works great for a quick tan! Easy to use and works on any skin tone. Would recommend to anyone needing to add color to themselves.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Will never need to tan at the salon ever again !</li>
            <li> Since I cannot tan naturally, and I also don&#x27;t want the harmful effects of tanning, I am always looking for a great self-tanner.  Honestly, this has some major pros and cons.  Pros - it goes on incredibly easy using the provided glove.  It doesn&#x27;t streak and I also loved how you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  Cons - it doesn&#x27;t last long.  And yes, I know all the things you are to avoid once you&#x27;ve applied it - no skin oil, no lotion that contains lanolin or oil.  After getting out of the shower, don&#x27;t rub dry...etc., etc.  Even so, I feel like the color lasted only 24-48 hours.  Will I keep buying this - yes because I feel like the ease of application and the natural color I get outweighs the short staying power.  I will continue to seek out ways to keep this from fading so quickly.</li>
            <li> not as easy of an application as it states. and it washed off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Its orange just like the rest of the self tanners...I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Works great however doesn&#x27;t last on me more than a day</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Easy to apply, color is really good.  I have fair skin and was concerned about streaking, color quality, and splotches, issues with other self-tanners.  This one got great reviews on another site so I gave it a try.  It is so natural looking.  It has not come off on any of my clothes.  It is easy to see where I have applied it.  The mitt works really well for applying the product so it goes on smoothly.  I used it every day for four days and the color gradually deepened.  It was always very natural looking.  I then traveled over the Memorial Day holiday and didn&#x27;t take it with me.  The color stayed very nice throughout.  I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Has a little bronzer if you need some tan right away.  After that washes away it leaves a very nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use!!  love it</li>
            <li> After trying several brands, this is the best one so far. I&#x27;ve found out that less is more. So I apply a light coat daily until I get the tan I want. Then maintain with once a week application.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use with no smell.  After using several days in a row I did find there to be a slight tanner smell but not overbearing.  It was easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had a missed spot or a random spot else where that I touched by accident.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this! It was easy to apply and made me look like I had a natural tan. I also really liked that it didn&#x27;t stain my clothing. I would put the tanner on before bed and then rinse it the next day and it would rub off on my sheets and clothes but I could wash them and it came right out. Actually it wsn&#x27;t the tanner that was on the stuff but the color guide. Which by the way I love that it has a color guide so you can tell were you have already applied it. I loved this so much I have bought up 3 more bottles and from now on this is the only product I will be using since I am so fair skin and I usually burn instead of tan in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have had vitiligo which is the same skin disorder Michael Jackson had.  I has tons on white spots all over my body and have tried everything possible for years.  Fake Bake applied with a Q Tip has been then only thing that has worked.  I was so tired of using makeup that washed off and got on everything  I have vitiligo on my hand, arm, stomach, and legs.  Nothing has worked as well as this!</li>
            <li> This product is the greatest sunless tanning i&#x27;ve ever used. Fake bake flawless dries really fast so it takes little time. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all! It allows you to see where the color is as you put it on so it&#x27;s goof proof. I have very sensitive skin also so i tested the product on my skin before i used it and i didn&#x27;t break out, which has happened a LOT with other sunless tanners i&#x27;ve used. I have used SO SO SO many sunless tanners and they have always had their cons, either me breaking out, or turning me orange, or streaks being everywhere! but not with this! I am extremely pale so this is perfect! It gives you a perfect glow for starters and if you want it darker you can just apply more! I have no streaks and it just looks perfect and with NO SMELL! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! way cheaper than spray tans! this item comes with gloves and a mit you use to put on the product so you don&#x27;t get spots all over your palms!</li>
            <li> All the reviews were right, and I am so glad I took a chance on this product. I have tried just about every self tanner out there, and this one makes me look as if I just spent a week sunning myself on a tropical island. Absolutely not orange at all, and I could detect no smell other than the slightly fruity, tropical scent. Gosh, am I happy I bought this. I took the advice of previous reviewers and followed all tips, which I am sure is the reason the product went on so flawlessly. After exfoliating with a coarse sugar scrub, I applied lotion lightly to my elbows, ankles, toes, knees (both front and back), and even my neck (I&#x27;m 50 and have a few wrinkles). I&#x27;m going on a cruise with my daughter this week, and now I won&#x27;t have to worry about blinding everyone with my lily white, glow-in-the-dark skin!</li>
            <li> I am a very fair-skinned redhead with some freckling. I have only used this product once so far and am pleased with the color it provided (I really went for it and put it ALL over). It is not, however, fool proof - I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and yet found some streaky places and grubbiness on the knees, but as I applied it in the wee hours in not-the-brightest light, I will chalk that up to user error. The color guide is very helpful in seeing (for the most part) where you have applied it. It was 10ish hours before I showered after application and aside from the color guide washing away, the tan remained on my skin. It was not a shocking color change that would cause second glances, but I can tell it took the glare off my skin. I didn&#x27;t find the smell offensive, but a vague coconut-y if chemical scent remains that lasts into the second day. I am quite pleased and will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Always good. Holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Not Loving it so far-&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to put on for even coverage.  Blotchy appearance on anywhere that it not pre moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried using moisturizer before application which worked well, but very little color was retained after 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Not for face- don&#x27;t even try if you have any oily patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, just my experiences- but I always try to be fair and plain spoken in all my reviews.</li>
            <li> I am buying a case of this stuff. No streaks, no wait time, instant brown with no orange. Only pit fall is that it is MESSY with over spray. Line the counter and sink with a large old towel and you will be fine. Use regular lotion first so you don&#x27;t get any blotches. No need for fancy scrubs, use a cheap one and you will be fine. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have used several types of tanners over the years, from way back when the dinosaurs came out with Q-T tanning, the fastest way to orange ever invented. I have used tanners more recently with systems that were more expensive and looked alright, this looks amazing! I did do a full intense full body exfoliating first and that likely made a big difference, as well as the great mitt that comes with this kit. I did cut the tube for the sprayer as suggested by other reviewers. As soon as I used this I looked like I had been tanning all week. In a  couple of hours I looked like I had been poolside all summer. I happened to be going out bra shopping in the evening and looked great in the mirror. The product dried almost immediately, not pacing around waiting for a cream to dry and it did not rub off at all. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Probably the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used.  Its not streaky and doesn&#x27;t look fake on me.  I like the mitt that comes with it because it makes applying the spray easier and blends it in nicely for a more natural look.  I notice a difference in my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; from just one application.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff can&#x27;t wear shorts without it! Best instant tanning spray ever.  Really messy though.</li>
            <li> A tan so natural, you will look like you visited San Topei!</li>
            <li> Works great! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> By far the BEST self tanner out there! I have tried all of the Fake Bake products and although I think they are all great, the mist is the best, I love the cloth mitten that comes with it to apply the tanner, It makes it so much easier and even than using gloves alone. I had an event to attend on Sunday so before I went to bed on Thurs, Fri and Sat I applied the tanner, took a shower the next day and by Sunday I had a beautiful all-over bronze.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised... I&#x27;ve tried other sunless tanning products on my very fair skin but they end up looking blotchy and orange. I really like the &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; application; it&#x27;s spreads nicely, gives an immediate color that continues to develop through the day/night without looking unnatural. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff works beautifully.  It&#x27;s easy to apply with the spray bottle and velvety application mitt.  You can see if you&#x27;ve left any streaks, due to the slight bronze color as you are applying...so you can take care of those before they become a problem.  And you end up with a lovely bronze tan that looks like you spent a weekend on a beach...not too dark, but definitely a noticeable medium shade tan.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a 20 yr old guy and it has always taken a lot of sun to get my skin tan. I can honestly say that using this stuff gives me a decent tan that by no means looks orange. It just looks like a great summer tan. I spray it on at night and I can tell what spots that need to be sprayed or rubbed into. It dries quickly then I&#x27;m off to bed. When I wake up, I shower it off and am left with a natural looking tan. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I was a bit weary purchasing this with all the reviews about the smell and color. But once i got it and tried it, i loved it. I am one of those girls who loves the smell of suntan lotion. And this smelled like i just walked the beach. Word of caution, make sure you use a scrub. If not, your pores may absorb it and leave tiny black spots. But if you scrub before use and after as suggested, it looks amazing. No orange tint or funny streaks.</li>
            <li> The product is great.  Shipping took a bit too long, though.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The only sunless tanner I ever used before this was Jergen&#x27;s gradual tanning lotion (which doesn&#x27;t smell great and gets streaky easily). I had no idea what to expect with Fake Bake, but here&#x27;s a rundown of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;- Did not streak, despite me having no former experience with a spray tanner&lt;br /&gt;- Did not look orange&lt;br /&gt;- Blended really well (didn&#x27;t look weird between my face and neck)&lt;br /&gt;- Very natural looking&lt;br /&gt;- Mitt fibers started falling out by the end of the first use, so I bought a new one for 10 bucks from another brand and it&#x27;s perfect&lt;br /&gt;- Dried quickly enough to not have to wander around naked but slow enough to make sure it was rubbed in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use a fancy exfoliator beforehand. I simply showered and used my normal loofah with a gritty body wash. Despite the mitt being flimsy, I still give this product five stars for looking so natural and being so easy to use. Scrap the mitt and but a new one for 10 bucks that doesn&#x27;t need a glove underneath and you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner. I have tried lots of them &amp; this one works best, dries fast, smells nice &amp; looks natural.</li>
            <li> This product has really good color but does not last long (3-4 days). I know everybody&#x27;s body is different and what works for some does not work for others. I do shower in the evenings and again in the morning to shave so this could be a reason. This is the reason I only gave 2-stars.</li>
            <li> I have vitilgo and hate wearing shorts in the summer due to that. This is ideal for making an even skin tone, goes on quick , smells good, dries fast and works. My GF who does not like self tanning product had me order some for her daughter after she saw the results.</li>
            <li> I watched an on-line review for this product and it recieve a high score.  It was spot on!  This is an easy application,  it sets flawlessly and dries quickly. The color is exactly as it says, a medium bronze. It is my first time using a self tanner and this has been a good experience. It only  lasted about 3 days so if you use it make sure  you apply it around the 2nd or 3rd day to keep your color. I recommend this product for first time users. Word of advise, cut the stem on the pump sprayer (about an inch) so it does not leak and use a  towel because the spray can fall on the ground or surrounding. I sprayed it directly on the mitt and held the sprayer almost right on it to avoid spraying my  surroundings.</li>
            <li> Good color and coverage.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING AND WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Good Stuff, I bought this because I will be in a wedding on December 15th. I will be wearing a gown exposing my arms, back, shoulder, and chest ( not too much). I wanted to have a slight glow.  I applied it last night to get an idea of how it looks and I wish I had know about this product a long time ago, I would have used it on my legs in the summer. I do not go to the tanning bed, so this product is exactly what I need!! It applies perfect, my tan looks very natural and beautiful. Loving this product, can&#x27;t wait to show my mother. Also to add I am not fair skinned, I tan easily, but I am pale during these cold months. This product was easy to apply and would recommend this for anyone looking the a quick tan look!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self tanning products and they turned me orange.  I do not tan AT ALL!!!  This product was very easy to use and had a nice scent.  I did notice that after a few weeks, it started to have a &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; look.  I like that fact that it had some color so you could see where you had alread applied it. Great price.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping . This is a great self tanner , I will purchase again. looking forward to trying other  Fake Bake products. Thanks again...</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person, but this still gave me a good color without looking overly tan. The kit does it&#x27;s job and makes things streak free. It lasts about four to five days on me before I would need to do it again, but I use a loofah everyday.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply without any mess.  Gives good color and has no unpleasant odor.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> no orange color, I use this everyday! I finally found this and was recommended by my hair stylist!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of it&#x27;s abilities because of all the negative preconceived ideas about &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; sprays.  No streaking! Super easy!  Light fragrance. Long lasting.  Don&#x27;t ignore the exfoliating requirement or you&#x27;ll be sorry! I&#x27;m happy to share this product with anyone looking for a healthy glow in a short amount of time.  Now while I&#x27;m sitting here typing the review I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll give myself a glow this weekend!</li>
            <li> I have VERY fair skin. I was very happy with the natural look this product gives. I was not looking for a very dark tan so not positive that reapplying daily really gets any darker. It seems to be just the initial color. Don&#x27;t trust the cap too keep from leaking.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years. For some reason, this time it has been streaking on my skin more than usual. Not sure if it&#x27;s the product I had bought at Ulta. I still use it, though.....</li>
            <li> Great product! I ordered my second bottle a few weeks back for when I ran out of my first. Works just as great as my first bottle. I always make sure I rinse my mitt with hot water immediately after using and I leave it sit out on top of my bottle to air dry. Best looking non orangey self tanner I&#x27;ve used in a while. Did I mention it smells amazing!!!?? Like coconuts!!! No icky harsh smell. The only time I&#x27;ve ever streaked using this is when I stupidly forgot I applied it and did something outside and got my legs wet, like washing my car or watering the garden. Not smart, duh. My flannel gray sheets did get a brownish red tint on them as I slept with freshly applied tanner on myself, but it completely washed out when I washed them. I now have my red cotton summer sheets and it doesn&#x27;t show up on that at all. Overall a pretty great product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a second bottle if I didn&#x27;t absolutely love a product because I always like trying out different products. This one gets a thumbs up! 👍🏼</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome. It smells like coconut and I love it. It looks amazing the morning after and is easy to blend. It does come off unevenly but I find that happens to almost every self tanner. It&#x27;s different for everyone. I&#x27;ve tried st tropez and I have to say this is so much better! It&#x27;s worth it. I was unsure about buying it but I love it. Just make sure to moisturize dry spots!</li>
            <li> The product works great and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks!!  I cut the spray hose down so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  The only problem I had was that the mitten fell apart first use and left brown residue all over body.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and it gives her a decent tanned look all things considered.  I forbid tanning beds even though she works at a gym and gets free use.  She has purchased this twice and the look is pretty decent.  I personally think that she could do without it, but it makes her happy and doesn&#x27;t look to fake.  Better then the risk of tanning beds or even the sun.</li>
            <li> Tried this product based on reviews.  Like the color, but not the application.  And, it is not streakfree application.  Plus, the pump broke (only a few times after use).  My advice...don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of any kind of tanner including the sun. I was deathly afraid of oompa loompa land but was encouraged by the pics and reviews. This product goes on easy no dry time and is more of a tea stain color than carrot.</li>
            <li> Works great and it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  Easy to apply and I like the mitt.  It doesn&#x27;t streak and looks natural.  I will buy again because its easy and it does the job!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It goes on so well, color is great and subtle. I&#x27;ve even upgraded to the darker color, which is also great. The mitt and glove are a game changer as far as application. Way better than lotions or other sprays. However, the mitt gets a little worn out before the bottle is out. I rinse it out after every use.  I use to be a regular spray tanner, but now I just use this.</li>
            <li> By far the best sunless tanner I have tried thus far in my 20 years of being an avid tanner. I recommend Fake Bake to everyone I know, no matter your skin tone it blends beautifully :)</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but a little difficult to do your back.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! Provides and even tan and I LOVE it!!!! Definitely more than I expected, i cannot believe I have been wasting my time and money paying for airbrush tans this long!! This product is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that recently went on vacation to Miami and Vegas, and didn&#x27;t want to blind all the beautiful people with my winter paleness. So I bought this on recommendation from my girlfriend, and it works really really good. The mit does a great job at applying the solution evenly without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes for those trying this for the first time from my trial and error:&lt;br /&gt;- Take a shower first and exfoliate if you want the tan to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t apply too much at once. Similar to painting, if you get too eager and apply too much at once, you&#x27;ll develop streaks.&lt;br /&gt;- Do several light coats over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;- Do not sweat when after you apply it to your body, or let water touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Put lotion on drier parts like elbows and knees before applying tan.&lt;br /&gt;- After the tan has had several hours to do its magic, take a shower to rinse the residue off. Water will run brownish, and is normal. This is the residue running off. If you don&#x27;t shower, you will ruin your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;- I had to do 3 applications before achieving a beautiful, natural looking radiant tan.</li>
            <li> If you want a beautiful golden glow without sacrificing healthy skin, this is the product for you!!  It has a pleasant smell and is so easy to apply.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t streak, look orange, or smell weird. Looks so natural, and is so much better for your skin than a tanning bed. Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> Way too much trouble to apply.</li>
            <li> By far the best fake tanning solution I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This was lingering under my sink for what seemed like forev. I finally used up my St. Tropez foam self tanner and pulled this baby out. Lets just say, AMAZE. I didn&#x27;t think I would like it as much b/c its a liquid spray, not foam, like the St. Tropez, but it works perfectly well and blends easily. And it smells super tropical which I love. The color is so natural, I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments. Love!</li>
            <li> I love it...best sunless tanner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and have LOVED it.. this one I received? Did NOT AT ALL go on like the one I had used just last week.. not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Did the 3 days as per directions. Did not get as dark as I wanted. And it fades far to quickly. If you use astringent with cotton ball, most of what is on your face comes off on the cotton ball. The mitt is excellent. The product itself is just fair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use Fake Bake, as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it. I never tan in the sun, I&#x27;m too afraid to! I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanners, and normally I use Xen Tan but decided I&#x27;d try this.Here are some pros &amp; cons, unfortunately mostly cons, I just wasn&#x27;t impressed by this at all.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It dried really fast, and was pretty easy to see where I&#x27;d put it already Also, this seller shipped it super fast which is always nice. Also, I applied it at night, it did not stain my clothes or sheets.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The color payoff was disappointing. I applied it at night and in the morning I was a beautiful shade of bronze, not orange, but a gorgeous brownish-pink color. I waited until the next evening to shower, even though it says you only need to wait 4-6 hrs, and after i showered, I was a streaked mess and most of the beautiful color was gone. I did not even scrub my skin, I rinsed it lightly with baby wash. So disappointing. The next day I applied it again at night, and the color once again looked good, but after showering again, I was left once again with blotchy, icky looking color. Also, when you spray onto the mitt, it goes EVERYWHERE! Luckily I sprayed it into my sink and then I had to just clean the sink up.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of trying for a third application I used my Xen Tan and now I look like I just came back from holiday. I will never use this again, giving it to my sister to see if she has better luck!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner on the market, hands down. I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
            <li> By far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. Goes on smoothly, and streak free. I love the coconut smell and how quickly the product absorbs. The built in bronzer leaves a really nice color while the tanner is developing. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have repurchased several times because the tan is really build able and comes out very dark. Once dry, it doesn&#x27;t really rub off or streak either.. Mitts however, only work when you first get them, after one wash they start to develop these balls / pills that make the texture hard and tan doesn&#x27;t apply as effectively.</li>
            <li> Well, to me this was not that great. It soaks into the mitt, so most of the tanner is absorbed into the mitt, not on your skin. Forget about putting it on your face!!! It was the worst, blotchy, uneven color! I have combination skin, and on the dry areas it was super dark, and the oilier areas no color. I even used moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t help. For me, this was not very good at all.</li>
            <li> I like Fake Bake but it is a bit difficult to work with. It will give you a nice, dark color but you have to be careful to blend well since it is a liquid/spray. The mitt is a must. You can easily end up streaky, spotted, etc. It definitely requires some skill to application. I think the scent is pretty good as far as self tanners go. They all have that yucky self tanner smell. I think the fake bake is a bit overpriced. I prefer other self-tanners but I do agree that this one has a good color.</li>
            <li> If you are used to getting spray tans, I&#x27;m not sure this product is for you.  This product is great if you are in a huge hurry and have no time for a spray tan.  Gives immediate color.  Smells good compared to other tans in a bottle.  The downside is the color fades quickly. lasting only a few days.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Super easy to apply and leaves even the palest person(me) with a even golden tan. A coworker who owns her own tanning bed was absolutely gobsmacked to find out I was using a self-tanner and not visiting a tanning salon. No orangey color and it even has a nice smell. Just follow the instruction and you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> I found this self tanner by doing some online research into the best tanners.  This one was recommended often.  I ended up paying quite a bit less than the others mentioned they had paid.  It arrived quicker than I expected.  I tried it on one hand right away using the mitt. Nice smell.  Color is perfect. Natural. Lasts even though I wash my hands a lot!  The best part is that there is no nasty smell after it &amp;#34;develops&amp;#34;.  None!  I do recommend following the directions.  Exfoliate first and moisturize, then apply the product.</li>
            <li> Warning: This self tanner WILL stain your sheets and I&#x27;m still trying to get it out of mine. However, it is an amazing self tanner and might be one of my favorites. I have tried just about every self tanner there is and this is right up there with St. Tropez. It does not leave you streaky or orange and provides just the right about of color so you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve got self tanner on. It also doesn&#x27;t put off that awful self tanner smell. I highly recommend this but don&#x27;t use it with nice sheets!!!</li>
            <li> Stains skin immediately, deepens over next 12 hours or so.  Looks very natural, no orange tinge.  Consistency is very water-like.  Upon using it the 1st time, spilled some on my house dress &amp; bed sheets, didn&#x27;t wash them for over 24 hours &amp; was sure it would stain, it did not stain either item at all.  Really like it!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self tanners, even salon spray tan. Fake Bake is amazing! Pleasant smell,  drys quickly,  and truly no streaking!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of sunless tanners and this is by far my favorite! it is so easy to apply, and you can see where you have applied it so you don&#x27;t miss a spot. I put it on after showering in the morning, and through out the day had gorgeous color. Even after I showered I had a nice tan through the week. I plan on using this two evening before my wedding. I recommend showering before you wear something nice. I wore all day without showering and didn&#x27;t notice any color on my clothes. But I did notice it on the clothes I wore to bed. This stuff also has a great smell. My fiance even complimented me on how good I smelled! All in all this is THE BEST sunless tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I was surprised after the mass of positive reviews how lukewarm I was on this product. The color, while not orangey, was very light and wore off oddly in my joints (which is typical of self-tanners but I have better ones that wear more evenly). I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle cause I paid for it, but, overall, not impressed :(</li>
            <li> as a Midwesterner.. I don&#x27;t tan on my legs and often retain that winter white, which can be odd looking... I have tried many options over the years but I can honestly say that this is the best product I have tried. Follow the instructions and it gives a great result. I listened to other reviewers and slept on a dark sheet and showered in the morning... My husband said this is the best results he has seen from my trial and error.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanner for years. I have tried every UV bed, spray tan, and tanning lotion on the market. I have olive skin when I&#x27;m tan, so I try to go for the natural brown and not orange look. UV beds were addictive until at age 26 I had to have a tumor removed from my skin. Seriously, if you use conventional UV tanning, I guarantee you&#x27;ll care when you get tumors/cancer and your skin will seriously age by 30. I now have a scar on my chest, less than cute! Spare yourself the scarring if all you care about is looks.&lt;br /&gt;I had a membership for sunless tanning that seemed to be the only way to get a regular tan somewhat conveniently. At home tanners never got me as dark and were all streaky when applied.&lt;br /&gt;THIS TANNING SPRAY AND MIT SET IS AMAZING!! This stuff is sooo easy to use and gives me an instant dark tan with the bronzer, and develops to a very natural colored dark tan over a few hours, so that by the time you shower and rinse off the bronzer, you are tan underneath. This DOES NOT rub off on clothes and goes on so easily. I spray the mit about four or five times and rub it onto my skin. The fantastic thing about this spray is that you can add more or continue to blend it into skin and it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and streaky like other sunless tanners. I&#x27;ve never had to leave streaks due to too many layers of tanner or too many attempts to blend it. The combination of the gloves and mit completely prevents my hands from staining. The mit makes application incredibly fast and smooth, streak free. This stuff dries amazingly fast (you can still add more to the dry parts to add more color or even out a streak) and doesn&#x27;t get on clothes. Where I used to have to carefully apply lotion, wash my hands a million times, and stand around naked waiting to dry, now I quickly apply this and immediately go get dressed. My skin always looks tan now. It takes only about five minutes to apply over the whole body. There is literally no inconvenient aspect to this spray. Itis as easy as drying your skin off with a towel, only you&#x27;re applying tan. It lasts for about three days and then when it starts to fade it does so evenly and without patchy spots. You can even add contouring to your body (think extra cleavage and instant abs). I am so excited to find this product. I am canceling my spray tan membership, which will save my hundreds a year, I don&#x27;t have to worry about skin damage AND I can easily look great every day. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is still my favorite tanner months after my original purchase, and after trying several others including mousses and sprays. I just ordered my second Fake Bake kit. My mitt wore out around the time that I ran out of tanner. It was still usable, but had little pills on it that caused streaking. I had also been using it with other tanning products, so if I had used it alone, it would have out-lasted the Fake Bake spray. So you get a new mitt every time you buy this product and the mitt lasts through the use of the entire 6 ounces. I washed it after every tan application with warm water and whatever hand soap I had on hand. I then let it air dry. I did cut the plastic pump bottle tube so that it was not longer than the bottle is tall. I will do that again with my new one. This product smells so good that I actually get complimented on what scent I&#x27;m wearing, as if I&#x27;m wearing perfume. It&#x27;s a tropical coconut smell. The reason this is hands down my favorite tanner, even though I&#x27;ve found one that is darker (St. Moriz Dark Mousse), is that it is so easy to apply and dries so fast that as soon as I set down the bottle and wash the mitt, I can go get dressed. It always looks really even, not splotchy, even when I&#x27;m being lazy and apply it without much attention. Even my most hard-core tanning friends don&#x27;t like tanning every day because their products are a hassle and they have to wait an hour to put on clothes. You could easily use this every day. Takes me 10 minutes tops and always looks better than being pale!</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with Fake Bake self-tanning spray. I used to tan in a tanning bed daily, even though skin cancer runs through my family and it is terribly unhealthy; however, I refused to get a spray tan out of fear that it would turn me orange, look blochy, rub off easily in skin creases &amp; folds, etc. I work at a hotel Front Desk &amp; one day someone brought all the ladies there a bag full of Fake Bake products. That day I tried it at home and I have vowed to never go back into a tanning bed again! It honestly blends in with ALL skin types- from the fairest to the most naturally dark. It is perfect!</li>
            <li> This works great for me, easy to use and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> My favorite fake tan product so far. I&#x27;ve tried a lot , and thos one is my absolute favorite.  I like the fact that to get a tan skin you dont have to apply it over night or for hours before color appears , you can see difference right away!</li>
            <li> MY SEARCH IS OVER!!! Best self-tanner ever! The product goes on evenly, dries super fast, and has a very deep natural color.  It also has tropical scent that is very pleasant and not over powering. I will never buy any other brand again!!!</li>
            <li> Streaks. Make sure you specifically do circular motions or it&#x27;ll make you blotchy</li>
            <li> I fear lots of compliments on &amp;#34; my nice tan&amp;#34; , &amp;#34; where have you been&amp;#34; . I will be back. Product has a nice scent too!!</li>
            <li> This product had amazing reviews, so I figured that many people couldn&#x27;t be wrong. Yes, using this product gives you an all-over immediate tan, but if you wear it to bed as people state, then it doesn&#x27;t even help you look good (while you sleep? not helpful). I woke up in the morning and it was ALL OVER my sheets and pillow. I had to wash everything. Unless you have black sheets, pillowcase, and comforter, I don&#x27;t suggest wearing this to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put it on in the morning, then try to wear it during the day. Well if you sweat or your clothes run against your skin at all, it creates a creepy weird sweat line anywhere that happens. Then I end up with lines everywhere... And I&#x27;m Italian and have deeply colored skin to begin with. This is certainly not a flawless product. It can only be used in certain circumstances since it rubs off everywhere before the tan develops. I&#x27;d like a product better that absorbs into your skin and a tan develops from the inside out, rather than the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this product again, sadly.</li>
            <li> I know a long review is annoying, but I can not stress enough how AWESOME this product is!!!!  I have very pale skin, and this gives beautiful, very natural color to even the palest girl.  It fades naturally, it has a bit of an odor, any tanner that claims it doesn&#x27;t is lying.  Goes on super easy, color shows right away, LOVE LOVE IT!!!!  The only negative, if you get wet; like if you get caught in the rain, or are taking the cover off the pool, it can streak.  GRRR!  but, they all do.  If you use tanners you already know, it is a process.  You need to plan ahead so you can fix mistakes,  and you need to exfoliate, but it dries almost immediately.  Okay, if you need more info ask me!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of self tanners over the years, including the original Fake Bake lotion, but this light spray goes on flawlessy and has no odor at all!  The color is natural and looks like you just got back from a beach trip.  No orangey or bronzy tones, just great tan color!  It dries super quick with no sticky feel.  I use an exfoliating glove and Moroccan  Black Soap prior to applying this tanner.  This ensures even and perfect color!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, quick drying, gradually builds color, looks natural. Love it would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This washes off in the shower.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I came back to this after trying the drugstore (aka cheaper) versions.  Exfoliate first, with a dry brush for example.  Gives you beautiful color.  Smells great.  Can run off a bit in the shower so you need to maintain somewhat, but hands down it&#x27;s far superior to Jergens, et al.</li>
            <li> this product is just absolutely amazing. I reccomend to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY self-tanners and this is hands down, the best! Smells like coconut oil vs chemical --nice! And if applied as directed with the soft mitt, it goes on flawless without streaks. The spray bottle has too long of a \\&quot;straw\\&quot; so you might want to cut a small section of it off before using (so it isn&#x27;t coiled up inside the bottle). You can tell this is a better product right from the start as it has a brown color vs orange right out of the bottle. It looks GREAT compared to all other self-tanners. DO follow the directions though --put a little moisturizing lotion on elbows, knees, hands and feet so they don&#x27;t absorb too much product (these areas usually do and you end up with orange mottled feet!) Not so with this. Buy it, read directions and try it --you will not be disappointed! I live in Florida but do not want to LOOK like I live in Florida --as in, I don&#x27;t want to be wrinkled with alligator skin) so I wear full sunblock and use this instead to look like I have some \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. Love it!</li>
            <li> It went on ok an was easy to use but it washed right off.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it&#x27;ll do! Gives you good color in a hurry</li>
            <li> I love this product! No streaking, no orange color and it smells good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is garbage....  I&#x27;m mixed with yellow toned skin and this stuff made me look like a rust covered s***. It seems as though this product was designed for peach toned and super pale people.    The smell is very delightful at first whiff but after being on the skin for more than an hour it starts to have a very odd and displeasing smell. I applied it and rinsed it off after 8 hours only to find that certain parts washed off more than others (the color was even before showering)    Three days later, I&#x27;m stuck with this crappy tan and it wont wash off ::::::(</li>
            <li> The first few applications seemed to work well since it provided a bit of color to my legs. However, a few weeks later I noticed a strange smell under the sink and soon discovered the applicator mitt was the culprit. Imagine my surprise when I picked it up and noticed a green tint all over the mitt. I washed the mitt in the sink with dish soap and hoped that would be the end of the dark kermit-like green color. Yet, when I applied the FakeBake using the dried mitt, the same green color appeared. I quickly washed it off and sprayed a small patch on a few friends to ensure it wasn&#x27;t just me. Sadly they saw the same green tint appear on their legs as well. Finally, I decided to use the spray without the mitt and was frustrated to see the greenish tint appear once again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I ever tried on. I was able to put it on after exfoliating  and then go out having a nice flawless summer glow. I was amazed to see the results right away! I even put it on my face. The only down side was that a few hours later when I got to bed smelled like any other tanning lotion, which I hate... Even though at first smelled like coconut it changed the smell after a few hours :( ... That&#x27;s the reason why I don&#x27;t give it a 6 star. Definitely worth trying it for when you need a great tan!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is so easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t leave you skin smelling as self tanner which is something I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> I regularly use St. Tropez, but thought I&#x27;d try this since it got such great reviews. I love the color I get from it, the smell is light and pleasant, and it&#x27;s easy to use. However, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. There is a bit of lasting color, I&#x27;m not as ghostly pale as before I use it, but I was hoping it would last more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found if I use it after a shower right before I go out it does give me a nice tan look, I just have to reapply each time I go out.</li>
            <li> After finally outgrowing the need for a damaging real tan, I have tried numerous sunless tanners.  After reading countless excellent reviews for this product, I purchased one box.  I was hooked - now a dozen or so boxes later, I&#x27;m still just as happy.  No more completely pale winter white skin for me!  Great price, easy to use, great transaction and delivery.</li>
            <li> love this product, easy to apply, the color nice and stays</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; flawless, just as it says.  I am very fair completed &amp; have used this 5 out of the past 6 nights but still don&#x27;t have the golden tan on my legs that I expected.  I DO have more color, just not much on my legs. Arms look ok.  Will try the lotion &amp; see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Does not turn you orange. The best self-tanner I have used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast arrival. What you see is what you get which is great!</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews about this product and I just wanted to give it a try. I love this product so much. It&#x27;s the best self tanner out there. No streaks, no weird smell, and dries quickly. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale can&#x27;t tan at all and I&#x27;m whiter than paper I&#x27;ve tried other products and this wins over all .. Gives a nice brown color not orange especially me being fo white exfoliate before applying last for me abt two weeks then reapply</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome! I can&#x27;t tan in the sun, or go in a tanning bed cause they are very bad. This product is a great alternative. If your thinking about buying, try it--You&#x27;ll love it. Just like I love it!!!  [[ASIN:B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews for this product, I decided to purchase this. I&#x27;ve used it about four times now, applying before bed. When I wake up the color is good, then I take a shower and all the color washes off. I tried applying two or three days in a row, but it still does the same thing! I have no idea why it&#x27;s not staying on!?</li>
            <li> This Fate Bake Flawless is wonderful and easy to apply. It really makes like you have a great tan with out the sun.</li>
            <li> ok, so all of the spray tans promise &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; results but seasoned shoppers are always skeptical, because (lets face it) there is nothing natural in a bottle of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;so i was really pleasantly surprised when 5 minutes after applying this, i looked in the mirror and saw beautifully tanned-relaxed-just stepped-of-that-boat-in-st-tropez girl.&lt;br /&gt;i am beyond thrilled. easy application, streak free results, never buying anything else for tanning again. and, frankly, will never bother sun-bathing either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times now and I am very satisfied with it. Like any other fake tan, it DOES have that smell BUT it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as other brands I&#x27;ve tried AT ALL.  The initial smell of the product is pleasing actually. After you shower though, there is that very slight smell like all the others leave but it is very, very faint. It does not make me feel selfconcious all day about smelling weird like the other products have! A little perfume and I&#x27;m good to go. I love how quickly the color shows up! I actually used it one morning and showered in an hour and still had a nice color- and I am naturally very pale! I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and several of my friends are already ordering it because they really liked the look. No orange tone at all. I don&#x27;t have any rusty spots and this just simply fades gradually away. I put it on before bed with the intention of showering the next morning and my beige sheets show no sign of the product at all. Nothing on my clothing! That&#x27;s very important to me! When you shower, the color guard comes off and leaves a nice, clean look. I&#x27;ve applied coconut oil and I&#x27;ve applied lotion over this after showering and it doesn&#x27;t fade it or smear it at all. The color lasts about 5 days, slowly fading away. I applied this Monday and didn&#x27;t really need to reapply tonight (Friday) but did anyway. With 3 uses, the bottle is still pretty full. I will guess that I can get 10-15 uses out of the bottle. As I said, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and I will be placing an order soon for another bottle just to be sure not to run out. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love fake bake!!</li>
            <li> I like this product for events that don&#x27;t require any sweating or getting wet. If I use this item and then go on a run I drip tanning spray but other than that its great for those special events where you don&#x27;t have time to get to the tanning bed for an extended period of time. I&#x27;m not a tanning bed type of person so this gives me quick color.</li>
            <li> performs what it said it would do, still using, but spray pump deal leaked all over the place!. but other then that, does give you a nice glow and it didn&#x27;t look orange LOL best bet is to buy one of those cheap spray bottles from dollar store and pour the stuff in there. for the price you&#x27;d think they have better spray pump on this. oh and if you mess up and wanna get this dye out, use a hand sanitizer it seems to remove from hands good.</li>
            <li> Goes on effortlessly and gives you a great tan after one app. Dries in minutes and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes!  Will be buying more, best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps me looking sexy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanning product I have EVER tried! Super fast shipping and great price. Will definately be re-purchasing! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend  the Fake Bake flawless that I just purchased. I purchase this product from the same person each time and have had great success .It is easy to use and provides a natural looking tan.I apply it at night and shower the next morning to rinse the skin.Results &#x3D;great coverage and great color.</li>
            <li> first time using this type of tanning solution. followed instructions and happy with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  By the reviews I expected this to be better than the drugstore brands.  It is not.  It takes all day to dry, it does streak if you are not extremely careful.  It also partially washes off in the shower the next day.  I will say however, the color is very pretty...just wished it lasted longer.  I am just glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff! I am low key addicted to it because I don&#x27;t need to wear makeup anymore, and it doesnt cause cancer LOL. I really recommend this to anyone and everyone. Make sure you apply in good lighting and I always put two coats on my legs just because I want my legs to be darkest and I have never turned orange or anything. And also the 6 ounce bottle actually last a really long time!</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m not orange! I&#x27;m golden yaaay! Only problem was it came off in the middle of my  chest where my bra wires come together. But I still love it.</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and lasts on my skin longer than most people said it would. Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have ever used. It&#x27;s easy and much faster than having to apply a lotion. The mitt makes it glide on evenly and quickly. I do try to rinse out the mitt after each use to make it last. And you do have to make sure to stay away from water until your tan has set for about 15 minutes to be safe. The tan looks natural and lasts.</li>
            <li> Lotion up before using this to prevent streaks. Works really nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to put it on, dry and go to bed without worry about it coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I shower it off after one nights sleep and it leaves a not-too-drastic color difference.</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone and had a little bit of a farmer&#x27;s tan going on. I was in an early fall wedding and had to get rid of the uneven tan so I wanted to try this instead. It&#x27;s easy to apply but even with using it daily for 10 days there was a barely noticeable change between my upper and forearm. Only after I started using this did I realize Fake Bake makes another product for darker skin! If you have a medium-medium dark skin tone, go with the Fake Bake Flawless Darker.</li>
            <li> i look like a gay fish</li>
            <li> Finally! Bronze, not orange like tanners I have bought at the store. Looks natural and it is easy to apply. Defintely do wash the mitten after every use. It is a pain to do, but otherwise the tanner dries and hardens the mitten and the application isn&#x27;t as easy and smooth. I have been soaking the mitten in hot water, but it&#x27;s probably more effective to actually wash it with soap (but I haven&#x27;t tried, too lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks gorgeous from the minute you apply it, no waiting to see how it came out. Lasts 5-6 days for me, although maybe a week to two weeks for it to com</li>
            <li> Best kind to use if you do it at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sunless tanners before to only be disappointed. I did my homework and tried to read as much about how to apply and which ones claim to do the job without making you orange and stinky. I do believe my search is  over!!! I exfoliated and used the included mitt to apply which was easy to use. So far after one application I have a beautiful tan with no orange in sight! The smell is very light with a very faint hint of coconut. Smells nothing like the sunless tanners I&#x27;m used to. Update: sadly this just washes off. Imagine going into the pool tan and coming out pale skinned. So if you are planning on just wearing it for an afternoon with no water involved this will work for you. It also comes off with sweat as well. I&#x27;m disappointed and really wanted to love this!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered this tanner because I had never used one before but now that I have...I LOVE IT! Make sure you exfoliate before hand and the night before you apply the tanner make sure you put body butter or hydrating lotion to your knees, elbows, and decolletage or else you may have little brown spots in those areas. This tan did not make me orange but a nice brown :) I&#x27;m usually very pale and I was so happy this gave me the color I wanted! The only downside is that after about an hour you apply it, it starts to smell AWFUL! At first it will smell like coconut but be prepared for the harsh self tanner smell to follow. My tan has lasted about four days and there are signs of fading but not too much! It&#x27;ll be good for another two days I assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No excess tanner came off onto my bed sheets but I made sure to lay down a towel before I went to sleep so the smell would not mold itself into my sheets. I recommend doing that because the smell has stayed on my towel and I self-tanned four days ago.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It&#x27;s a bit of a process prepping skin and applying. It really is a 2 person job, especially for your back. The results are great though. I do it at night and then shower the next morning. Looks so natural. I get complements every time I use it. If I were more diligent and used it more, I think the results would last longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything.  From cheap to very expensive.  This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  I felt that the mitt absorbed too much and it was wasting the product.  I started using the plastic disposable latex gloves (box of 100 is so cheap).  I put gloves on both hands  the Spray one part of body at a time (one leg, then the other leg, one arm, etc)  Then I blend in quickly in circular motion.  Get compliments constantly on how \\&quot;nice and tanned I am\\&quot;.  On the face....Spray and then use a small cosmetic sponge (ones used for foundation) and blend in.  I usually do two mists in a circle like motion on face (make sure you close your eyes) and one mist on neck.  (Blend face before you spray neck).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes you tan, not orange like some other products and has no gross smell to it. The mitt is nice, and I recommend shaving and exfoliating before doing this and leavin it on for 12 hours + then rinse off your body, and you will have a nice glow to your skin. Last for 5 days max</li>
            <li> It works great, nice even tan...no streaks! It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries super fast. However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. Have to reapply every couple of day, and I wish it gave me a little more color than it does...but at least I&#x27;m not white!!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this and recommended it to me. I have used many self tanners and never been satisfied with the results like I am with this one.&lt;br /&gt;This tanner is sooooo easy to apply and very natural looking too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a self tanning product that delivers a natural looking tan, is economical, quick and simple to apply!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Super easy and super natural.  I put it into my hands with a makeup sponge, not the mit, and they come out flawless. Thank you Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved being tan but knew that bed tanning was dangerous. I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and products and this one has been one of my favorites! Goes on so smoothly and looks natural! Only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t water proof- don&#x27;t cry with this on your face!!</li>
            <li> I made sure to read all the reviews and they were spot on!&lt;br /&gt;Always exfoliate before you use this, believe me! because it is so instant, it&#x27;ll show you all the spots that missed your razor... the mitt they give you gets a little worn so i make sure to wash it really good after i use it. i also put on a little lotion in those weird areas like the knees, elbows and wrists and ankles, just so it blends better. I&#x27;m loving this product, it just makes a mess in my shower area but other than that, its awesome!</li>
            <li> Great application. Good building tan. Got the exfoliating polish and face lotion in addition bcs I like the product so much!</li>
            <li> Love this...easy to apply looks good and more like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It worked fine and the color is nice.. But it didn&#x27;t last for more than one week !</li>
            <li> The absolute best fake tan spray or cream  I&#x27;ve ever used!!! The color is awesome,not even close to an orange tint. Very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I like the color, I love that it doesn&#x27;t stink like a lot of the tanners do. The only problem is the glove. Not very comfortable on your hand, and after a couple of uses it began erode, pieces were coming off, it was leaving &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; on my body. I washed it, and it stopped with the dirt, but still, the texture is a bit odd now. The glove needs to be replaced often.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, great product!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Easy, flawless application. Only complaint is that the tan is not very long lasting and becomes patchy looking after a couple of days. I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I didn&#x27;t exfoliate sufficiently or if that is just how the product works.</li>
            <li> It definatly doesnt look fake!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves no streaks and is extremely easy to use, it looks natural and is a great value!</li>
            <li> I take fake tanner well and know the process so when I saw this one I was excited so many reviews. It goes on smoothly. However the co,our is a bit orange. Also initially the smell is good but the next day even after a shower I could smell that bad fake tanner smell. Mmph</li>
            <li> I wanted to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; my legs before going on a cruise and this product did the trick. I&#x27;ve used self-tanners before but not like this product. The application glove is what made the difference, in my opinion; it helped me apply the lotion evenly so there were no uneven spots of color. One coat gave me a good non-artificial look (no orange color) and I used very little of the product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless Self Tanner works pretty well for me.  The biggest thing I&#x27;ve found is that you need to order more applying mitts.  It works great the first few times but after that the mitt starts to get crusty and it just doesn&#x27;t apply the same as the first times, doesn&#x27;t apply well at all actually.  So if you&#x27;re interested in this product also invest in some extra mitts if you want to continue to use.  I love it, I&#x27;m really white and it&#x27;s the only self-tanner that hasn&#x27;t made me look horribly orange like everything else.  The scent is nice at first, but after a while smells a little.  It lasts pretty long, and if you keep reapplying, obviously, lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay. It smells good at first, but you have to leave it on for several hours, and as time goes on, it smells worse and worse. It&#x27;s very difficult to apply the product, if not impossible on your back if you&#x27;re doing it yourself. They also don&#x27;t tell you until you read the directions, that you&#x27;re supposed to purchase their exfoliant and their oil prior to using the product. I used my own products instead and they worked fine. One thing that is definitely positive though is that you get color immediately and it lasts for a couple days, if you don&#x27;t reapply. I guess for a self-tanner it&#x27;s okay and it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than getting a spray tan at the salon, but it&#x27;s no miracle product.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with Fake Bake Flawless self-tanner. I go tanning in tanning beds but I&#x27;m trying to cut down on that so I&#x27;ve been trying different self-tanners for the last few months. Some of them turn me orange, some are streaky, and some have barely any color payoff. This product however, is amazing. The box comes with everything you need. Included in the box is: instructions, the application mitt, plastic gloves (to put on your hands under the mitt), the self-tanner, and the sprayer. Make sure you exfoliate before using this product, because your tan will be a lot more even and look nicer. You spray the self-tanning solution on the mitt, and blend it by rubbing the mitt in circular motions on the area you want to tan. I use this everywhere, my whole body, hands, feet, and my face as well. The solution is very dark when you put it on, so you can see what areas you have already done. Don&#x27;t worry, most of it will come off in the shower. I like to use this at night so it has plenty of time to set in before I shower in the morning. It dries almost instantly, and doesn&#x27;t have that disgusting self-tanner smell that most similar products have. It has great color payoff, but if you want to be darker you can use it a few days in a row until you achieve the color you want. In my opinion, Fake Bake Flawless gives me better color than a spray tan in a salon. I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone that wants a nice, even looking tan without using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.  Everyone comments on my \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  It does not look like a \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot;.  One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works well ~ great product!!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake goes on easily and personally I will only use self-tanners that contain bronzers so that you are clearly able to see exactly where you are applying it. You can easily see this product when applying which makes for an easy and even application. I feel that this product gives a nice, natural color tan. The only reasons that I would not give it 5 stars is because it rubs off very easily on clothing, sheets and towels long after it has dried. The other reason is that I don&#x27;t feel that the color lasts very long. In order to maintain a decent level of tan, I find myself applying this product daily.</li>
            <li> The only tanning product I have found that looks natural, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and fades evenly. Whether you  are new or experienced with fake tanning, I would highly recommend this product. One of my favorite things about this product is how fast that it dries on your skin. They recommend that you don&#x27;t sleep on white sheets without your body being covered so that it doesn&#x27;t transfer, however I have done this quite a few times and there has never been much transfer onto my sheets. I get when I use this tanner I get compliments on how healthy and glowy I look. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product through a beauty guru on YouTube and immediately bought it off Amazon. Ultimately, I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve just noticed I&#x27;m running low and came back here to repurchase. This stuff is awesome, DOESN&#x27;T SMELL, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, dries quickly, and most important the tan is very long lasting and looks REAL. I&#x27;m quite pale and this didn&#x27;t turn me orange in the slightest bit. Be wary of using it around elbows, knuckles, and knees though. Make sure to use a good moisturizer before tanning those areas. I&#x27;m also really pleased with how quickly I can apply this product. After showering, it takes 10 minutes max to apply. I would recommend spraying directly on your skin and rubbing in with the mitt, as I&#x27;ve found spraying it on the mitt wastes a lot of product. All around, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Absolutly Amazing product. Very easy to apply...wonderful smell...oh my god the smell..it DOES NOT have that self tanner smell at all. The mitt that is included is soft and makes this fake bake fool proof. The color is not orange what so-ever. I have a olive skin tone. I am in LOVE with this product. Couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about this self-tanner enough! It gives me a bronzed flawless glow. I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve been complimented on my complexion. I&#x27;m pregnant, so people have been telling me that \\&quot;I&#x27;m glowing\\&quot;, but really its because of this product lol. I&#x27;ve read some other negative reviewers, who say this product made them orange. The only way you&#x27;ll get an orange result is if you have on SPF or deodorant. The spray bottle hasn&#x27;t given me any issue with leaking. I&#x27;ve traveled with the spray container everywhere, and no problems yet. I think the mitt is the real clincher here though. It&#x27;s really what gives you the flawless result. However, I don&#x27;t like that the mitt isn&#x27;t machine washable or waterproof (hence the included gloves). BUT, it is very easy to buy a tanning mitt elsewhere with these qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives you even, tanned skin... it really does make you look flawless. Try it out!</li>
            <li> Hey you! Yes you, the pale person who has tried all the lotions and wipes but only gets a streaky orange tan. This is the ONLY stuff that works. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again. Put is this way. I live with my girlfriend, and she doesn&#x27;t even know my tan is fake. It goes on easy with the mitt, works instantly, doesn&#x27;t streak, looks 100% real, gives impressive results with one application, and smells like a freaking island paradise. You&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ve landed in Hawaii. If you are trying to decide which self tanner is the best, I&#x27;ve done the research for you. Get this now, and I promise you&#x27;ll be blown away.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning products and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used .  I would definitely recommend this product you&#x27;ll love it. I am about to order more</li>
            <li> Wow, I was surprised at how natural this tan looks, and i&#x27;m a pale blonde. I bought another brand to try but haven&#x27;t even given it a shot yet because i&#x27;m in love with this one!</li>
            <li> Wow this is my favorite tanner.  I have Irish skin, very fair with freckles and I don&#x27;t tan well. Tend to be either as white as rice or as red as a lobster. Recently my dermatologist told me to stay out of the sun and honestly I don&#x27;t like sitting out anyway but I don&#x27;t want to blend into the sand either.  I have tried so many fake tanners from cheap to expensive for years and years and years from Este Lauder to Jergens.  Fake Bake is revolutionary! It smells wonderful, goes on very easily and you get an instant bronzing effect while your tan sets in.  Honestly it&#x27;s probably the darkest tan I have ever had in my life.  I keep looking at my tan bod because I am amazed at how real it looks. Just wondering if holds up in the pool and ocean.  Some tanners come right off and defeats the purpose of trying to look tan in a bikini. Honestly the best tanner I have ever tried. I am a fake baker for life!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have ever used. I am super super fair skinned, and this spray turns me into a light brown tan person! The mitt is amazingly helpful in applying it. It dries immediately and you could hop right into bed or go about your day - a small amount will rub off on your clothes but it won&#x27;t cause the tan to be streaky. And, the color-guide, which is what is getting on your clothes, totally washes out in the wash 100%. It is an amazing product and a steal at this price! I would recommend it to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner! It has a great color and it&#x27;s so easy to use. There are never any streaks and I always get a nice, even color. NO ORANGE! :)</li>
            <li> NO ORANGE, NO STREAKS, GOES ON VERY EASY WITH THE MITTEN!! I CAN PUT IT ON ALL BY MYSELF. AND YOU GET AN INSTANT GOLDEN/ BROWN COLOR IMMEDIATELY!!! WILL BUY AGAIN AFTER I&#x27;M DONE WITH THIS ONE. OH, AND IT DOESN&#x27;T STAIN YOUR CLOTHES AT ALL....</li>
            <li> Unlike most self tanners, this tanner gives you a nice realistic tan.  Not an orangish hue like most.  The foam glove makes it very easy to apply in an even streak free manor. Really like this product since I can no longer be in the sun!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for over a year now and have nothing bad to say about it.  As long as you exfoliate and don&#x27;t leave it on too long you&#x27;ll be good to go! Without proper removal it&#x27;ll become blotchy on your skin from the fading.  But If you cleanse properly you&#x27;ll be good to go! I 100% recommend it to anyone that wants a quick long lasting tan.  And it&#x27;s cheaper than in the stores :)!</li>
            <li> By far the most convincing tanning product I&#x27;ve used. Also, it doesn&#x27;t streak when you wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner!! Will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> LOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE IT!</li>
            <li> I liked this product as a base coat. I was hoping it would make me more &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; but it gives me a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I like the smell and the application, while slightly time consuming, isn&#x27;t too bad. I hop of the shower, put lotion all over, wait for that to dry, then apply this all over with the mitt. If you follow basic self tanner 101 rules (exfoliate, bend elbows, etc), you should really like this too. I would recommend it to people that are pale because it does not make you orange. Also, I did not notice a building of tan either, which I was disappointed about. I was hoping that if I applied it every day I would gradually get darker, but it only maintained my color. Overall, good for winter if you are pale, but any other time I feel it would not be enough.</li>
            <li> this is great if you are looking for a subtle amount of color that can be applied easily without a huge time commitment.  Some suggestions: wash your mit after every use.  Just run it under water and the tanner comes right out very easily.  It takes just a few seconds and really helps maintain your mit.  Also I like to apply a body lotion before I apply the tanner.  This helps me ensure I won&#x27;t get any streaking.  Also, make sure you wear the latex gloves under the mit.  I made the mistake of trying to apply once without the latex glove and discovered that the tanner just seeps right through the mit onto your hand.  The best feature is it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other tanners.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of tanners and even the ones touting their formulas don&#x27;t smell usually smell.  This one doesn&#x27;t which is a huge bonus for me.  I&#x27;ve been using the fake bake darker flawless tanner and I really like that formula for those looking for a bit more color.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Super easy application and instant color so you can actually see where it&#x27;s at.  I apply at night before bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my white sheets at all. I ordered 2 bottles and sold one to a coworker and she&#x27;s ordering too. I&#x27;ve already placed a second order. I really can&#x27;t tell how long the color lasts as I am outside every afternoon but even if I have to use it twice weekly it&#x27;s still well worth the money!! Two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I have ever used. I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> WOW! Great color! I&#x27;m a pale girl and this gave me instant, brown, color. Dries very fast, once it&#x27;s dry I feel safe sitting on my white desk chair without leaving a mark. Mitt that comes with it is very good quality, especially for the price. Smells very tropical when I apply it, but 6 hours later when I wake up, I smell the self tan smell. (Which doesn&#x27;t bother me because I kind of like it... lol.) but by that time I&#x27;m already taking a shower to get the leftover residue and such off. This tanner is buildable and not streaky when applied with circular motions using the mitt! New favorite.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned person and highly recommend this product. Had no streaking and it smells great! I can now feel much more confident knowing I&#x27;m not aging my skin in trying to get a real tan. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> at first it smelled very nice like cocoanut but after 20 minutes it started to smell very bad I couldn&#x27;t sleep and had to wash it</li>
            <li> It gave a really great color, but the spray got all over my floor and cabinets, it was horrible, I went back to the orignial and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Top 5 best products I&#x27;ve ever bought! It was sketchy getting it off Amazon, but it really is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried. I have olive skin but avoid sun exposure &amp; this product gave me the perfect shade without the streaks or orange-ness. I will buy it as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have tried other sunless tanning products in the past and there is no comparison. I was so hesitant and skeptical that it took me two months of starring at the box to actually give it a try. I wish I would have had the guts to dive right in because its awesome! I am white and I mean I can&#x27;t hold color on a trip to Hawaii for more than two weeks white. My husband kids me when I wear dresses about my legs providing light for a dark room. Those days are gone! I shaved and exfoliated my legs last night. I waited about an hour after I got out of the shower, donned the gloves and mitten and tanned my legs. I love the built in bronzer that lets you see where you&#x27;ve applied the product, very helpful for application. This morning I was curious to see how much color would come off so I washed my legs with a poof and body wash. The bronzer came right off and the amount was minimal. The color is incredible. I&#x27;m not orange at all. I&#x27;m the perfect golden tan that I have always wanted and never been able to achieve with a sunless tanner. My legs look slimmer and more defined. Please please try this product, its the last one I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have any odor.  The only negative is the overspray so you have to pay attention where you are when you apply</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about self tanner products.  I never have any luck and always end up turning some form of umpa lumpa.  My legs are very very pale, so I was just looking for a little something to help get me some color, so that when I go to the beach I didn&#x27;t char.  Well, after being persuaded by several friends, I decided to purchase this Fake Bake product.  I AM SOOOOO HAPPY I DID!!!! I absolutely love this product.  It has a lovely smell, its easy to apply and IT WORKS!!! I can&#x27;t stress enough how beautifully naturally tan it made my ghostly florescent legs!! My only issue, if you could even call it that, since it&#x27;s not an issue with the product, but myself, is to take your time applying.  I have zero patience and after the first application I noticed I have to take my time and be a little more thorough in coverage, as I did get a little streaky.  If you are looking for an easy to apply, good smelling, natural looking self tanner, I would recommend Fake Bake.  5 all day son!!</li>
            <li> Best fake tanner!! Looks just like real tan from the sun! ! Like I&#x27;ve been laying in the sun :)</li>
            <li> Best fake tan I have ever used. I wish the guide color wasn&#x27;t so dark and obvious, but worth it anyway.  Smell is not bad compared to other fake tan brands. Tan lasts about a week with just one application.</li>
            <li> This made me turn into a carrot!</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions (and there are plenty of how-to videos on Youtube) you will get a golden, natural looking tan. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Rubs off...was embarrassed when I t started to rub off due to humid conditions</li>
            <li> I use to go tanning almost every week and decided that I no longer wanted to damage my skin nor pay the $70 a month so I started reading reviews and purchasing self tanners. I have tried L&#x27;Oreal gel, L&#x27;Oreal wipes, St. Tropez spray, St. Tropez lotion - you name the product and I have tried it. I liked the St. Tropez lotion but found after one application I would take a shower and most of the color would wash down the drain. My friend recommended this product so I thought I would try it and I absolutely LOVE it!!! It doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry to be honest it&#x27;s the fastest drying tanner I have used. It&#x27;s easy to apply since you can see the color immediately, and best of all the color stays! To develop color it does take a few applications - I did it three nights in a row and the color stayed for a few days. I bought mine from Amazon for $13 - definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Very easy</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I was literally a SUN ADDICT - tanning all the time whether outside or inside of tanning  beds. I had to stop when I became more aware of the consequences of sun overexposure. I was super skeptical to try this, as all my &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; tanning experiences have been a major FAIL with gross streaking and peeling... So I tried this Fake Bake and WOW. Definitely idiot-proof and easy to use. I love the beautiful almost instant beach glow I get! And this stuff actually lasts and fades naturally, no chunky peeling or scaling. It&#x27;s great. The only con would be to make sure you are prepared to change your bedsheets the next day as it does transfer (not necessarily taking your applied color off). Other than that, this is now my must have beauty product!</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product. No streaking and  great color. Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This is the only tanning product I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair, so in the spring and summer if I want to wear spring clothes this product is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Tips:&lt;br /&gt;You must cut the plastic tube to fit properly in the bottle, measure before cutting. It is always better to have it too long than too short.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever using a self tanning product (or before a spray tan) it is best to exfoliate your skin (and shave the areas you want shaved) BEFORE you put on the product. I shower and use a scrub and pat dry with the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next put on the gloves and shake the bottle very well.&lt;br /&gt;Put on the mitt provided in the box (whichever hand you prefer) then spray the mist directly onto your SKIN, then rub it in gently with the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to rub it too hard because it may irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt is very soft, I think that the brown side works best for rubbing in the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Fake Bake formula does blend very nicely, it does not appear &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; (isn&#x27;t orange, at least on my skin) and it is even (not splotchy).&lt;br /&gt;You can see where you have sprayed the product on your body but it does darken after 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;With any tanning product you want to do it before bed.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT SHOWER OR PUT ON LOTION AFTER PUTTING IT ON (don&#x27;t put lotion before putting it on either) This is wash the tan right off and you will have to do the whole process all over again! (that may seem obvious but I read stuff all the time about people complaining that it doesn&#x27;t work, but they were at fault not the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow the product to dry, I normally just hang out, clean up the news paper, and put everything away.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to wash the mitt as well, the tanning product may cause it to dry weird (with the fibers standing up) and it isn&#x27;t a smooth application, plus a lot of the product remains in the mitt. Remember while rinsing the mitt you are not supposed to get yourself wet!&lt;br /&gt;Right after that just go to bed, wake up happy and tan then go shower! You will see some of the color wash off of you, this is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: the spray is used to tan/stain your skin so it will also stain what it comes into contact with! I cover the floor with newspaper so that the mist does not stain anything.&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a nice smell in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance tips: Refrain from exfoliating your skin where the tanner is applied, it may become splotchy since you are tearing up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When drying with a towel you must pat yourself dry, rubbing excessively will make the tan fade (this goes for all unnatural tanning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoyed this particular seller, the processing of the order/shipment was VERY fast, and the woman that I spoke to was very kind. Good customer service, I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Best self tanning solution I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves an even, long-lasting tan that is a natural looking color, at least on my skin tone. My only complaint is that the &amp;#34;color guide&amp;#34; is too domineering and runny. I have to give it overnight to take action, then wash off the color guide before I want to be seen.</li>
            <li> Incredibly easy to apply and it gives you a natural color within minutes. You can see where you&#x27;re applying it, it sinks in really quickly and while it does have an obvious smell, it&#x27;s lighter, much less offensive and less self-tan-er-y than all the other products I&#x27;ve tried. Very little trouble with streaking even though I don&#x27;t exfoliate or use lotion before I apply it. It also doesn&#x27;t rub off everywhere and stain things. Builds up nicely and doesn&#x27;t collect on dry areas like elbows or ankles like some products do. Hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used - I have no desire to try anything else after this. The only issue is that it does collect on scabs so if you scratch mosquito bits while you sleep (as I might...) they&#x27;ll end up darker, as they do with every self-tanning product. I&#x27;ve tried multiple self-tanners over the years and have never used one regularly because they smell, wear off too quickly, streak and look fake. I use this regularly and probably will for years to come. Bonus: the bottle also lasts FOREVER. I&#x27;m on at least my 5th application, the last two times I&#x27;ve gone over everything twice and I still have half a bottle left. If you&#x27;re pale and you hate self-tanning products, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!! Never paying for a spray tan again!!</li>
            <li> Omg I LOVE this product. I love everything from the ease of application to the smell and the color it gives. NO ORANGE!!! I do have to do it twice to get the color I like, but just once gives a nice glow that is super wearable. I recommend this product to anyone that wants a tan without the damage!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you do not use this when you have any lotion, creams or oils on, it will not work on those areas.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  After exfoliating, I used a few squirts of this (I kept it light for the first application) and I was surprised by how lightly it went on and how well the enclosed glove worked to apply the product evenly.  The next day, after the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; set in, I was blown away by how natural and brown it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned girl of Norwegian descent and I&#x27;ve never had a tan look this good in my life - real OR fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. Love it!  It works best if you exfoliate in the shower and use lotion when you get out- especially on areas like knees and elbows.  It produces a really nice golden color, dries instantly. Plus the quantity of product for the price is great!  I have no doubt the bottle will last me all summer and probably longer.  The label also mentions to keep it longer to refrigerate it- nice and refreshing after shower on a hot day! The smell is nice too, not like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have used. I&#x27;m a fairly pale person, and I have gotten a lot of compliments on how tan I look. When I tell someone it&#x27;s a self tanner they don&#x27;t believe me because it looks so natural. I like the spray as opposed to lotion because of the quick drying time. I usually put it on a few minutes before bed and it&#x27;s dry after a few minutes. I have a white bedspread and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it transferring.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product I love it and will always use it&#x27;n looks so natural no orange or streaking just a natural looking tan</li>
            <li> Im a pale irish girl and this is BY FAR THE BEST SELF TANNER I have ever used. Nothing can compare to fake bake. NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is wonderful.  My skin imperfections still show through but would with a real tan too.  It was so easy to put on and dried so fast and gives a beautiful tan.  NO STREAKING!! Looks like I laid in the sun all day. Not orangy at all. It only takes a little of the product so this bottle will go a long way. The price is very reasonable too.  Get yours now because I am going to tell all my friends and family and the seller will be out of stock as soon as every one sees my tan.</li>
            <li> I am one who tans in a tanning salon. I have always been scared to ever even try spray tanner, but now I am pregnant so I can&#x27;t tan anymore. This stuff is AMAZING!!! It will easily work on any color type it DOES NOT look orange and doesn&#x27;t look splotchy at all. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but was glad I gave it a try. Mostly all self-tanners leave either a smelly, streaky &amp; orange tint on your skin, but this didn&#x27;t at all. The application was easy &amp; end result was great.</li>
            <li> Best Ever! I found that application goes on the best when my glove is damp before application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and the smell always nauseated me. I can tolerate this one, but other people can smell it on me. The only other product I use is Sally Hansen, but it has a shimmer to it I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Love this Fake Bake the best.&lt;br /&gt;The color absorbs well into the skin, not too dark. I have fairly light skin and it gave me a good glow.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really fond of this product mine was very liquidy and messy..</li>
            <li> Rubs off on your clothes hours after applying. Washed off quickly too.</li>
            <li> Good product but I like the can spray on Fake Bake better.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanning products for about 2 years and this product, is truly the best product EVER. What sets it apart from the rest is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it applies light brown so you can see if you&#x27;ve missed any spots. It looks natural and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only tanner I use now!! I&#x27;m a red head so I have very light skin....I&#x27;ve tried every sunless tanner out there and this is by far my favorite. You can get an instant tan or layer it on for a darker tan.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY self-tanner I have found that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange.  It also comes with a handy applicator pad.  I would definitely recommend this over real tanning.  Tanning is dangerous!!  Use fake bake and avoid the skin cancer.  If you&#x27;re going to use it regularly, I would recommend exfoliated at least every other day.  You&#x27;ll be patchy if you don&#x27;t.  I always exfoliate in the shower, then put this stuff on, let myself dry for about 30 minutes, and then put lotion over it to moisturize.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is what the directions recommend, but it works for me.  Remember, exfoliate.  This stuff is great for both guys and girls.  Careful putting it on your face, though.  It will turn your face very dark very fast.  Also be sure to bend your elbows and knees when you apply it there.  Otherwise, it will get in the cracks and look tacky.  Don&#x27;t get any on the soles of your feet or calluses on your hands.  It&#x27;ll turn them orange.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Perfect bronze color and easy to apply.  I have olive skin and have friends that are more fair skinned. Somehow this shade looks great on them as well.  Giving it 4 stars because it does come off on my sheets if I apply at night (which is the desired time indicated in the packaging).</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to self tanners and have tried them all including spray tans at the tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is applied with a mitt which provides even coverage. (You spray the product into the mitt and then apply to your skin.)  I love the color and it&#x27;s easy to apply the product to achieve a uniform tan. I used the Baiden Mitten to exfoliate before applying it. I&#x27;m so happy with the results. I won&#x27;t go back to the other self tanners or the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how great this looks, especially considering the price!  I have tried several self-tanners before and they were all orangey and/or streaky.  This goes on evenly, using the provided mitt, and turns a beautiful tan color, not orange at all.  Smells great and fades evenly.</li>
            <li> Great product- Easy to use, no smell-love it!</li>
            <li> Absolute best self tanner out there. I have used many different products throughout the years, and this is the best! Best color, dries instantly, hardly ever rubs off onto clothing.</li>
            <li> Love it..great golden brown color and 0 streaking!!! Highly recommend!! Have used many self tanners but this product is the best!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better. It was a perfect transaction and it arrived just as expected. I can&#x27;t believe I have been paying full price for this when I could have gotten it here all along.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and very natural looking... BUT this is not waterproof AT ALL. Still have yet to find a waterproof sunless tanner. This is great if you want fast results and arent planning on being splashed or swimming.</li>
            <li> I love fake-bake flawless! It is the only self-tanner I use after trying several brands (both cheap and expensive). It&#x27;s so quick to apply with the mitt, it only takes me about 3 minutes to do my whole body! The mitt makes the application very even and prevents my palms form staining. It also comes with gloves for extra hand-protection if you wish but I find just the mitt is enough for me. The tanner dries quick so I can put on my pajamas right after and go to bed. In the morning I have a nice even tan after my shower. It has a mild tropical scent that I like. I&#x27;ve never used a self-tanner that doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;self tanner smell\\&quot; after it&#x27;s been on my skin for a little while, but fake-bake has the most minimal \\&quot;self-tanner smell\\&quot; of any I&#x27;ve tried. Easy, fast, nice color that lasts about a week for me. And I think it&#x27;s a great price considering the quality and efficiency of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I used it all summer while I was preganacy and it was wonderful.  I would advise to order an extra mit thought, mine started balling up and leaving fuzzies on me after a couple of months.  OH and I used it about once or twice a week for 3 months ( and I did not use sparingly) and I still have lots left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for a few years now. I&#x27;ve tried Loreal, Jergens, Banana Boat, and other various brands at Sally&#x27;s, etc. I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this self tanner so I decided to give it a try. The day it arrived, I showered &amp; exfoliated my whole body. On certain spots I had left over Loreal self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t come off. When I applied this product I noticed it had a very nice smell, unlike many other self tanners and it applies very easily. It gives a fantastic color. Not orangey at all. The places where I already had self tanner were a bit splotchy so make sure you don&#x27;t have any other self tanners on when applying this. I will definitely continue to use this product. The price is not bad at all either since it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless: I wanted to try self tanners so I could have a nice tan for a wedding I am in, instead of using tanning beds. This is my first time having this self tanner and I was excited to try it out. Turned out great and it&#x27;s so easy to put on! Not even orange looking at all, no streaking because of the wonderful mitten worn during application process. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. So far so good! It also has a great tropical type scent!</li>
            <li> The spray and mitt are good but for me it came across streaky and it is very time consuming without good payoff.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> What a great alternative to the tanning bed! Fake Bake is quick and easy--and looks natural! It also smells a lot better and is less messy than other tanning sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Easy and not messy to use.  It says to use once a week but I find I have to use it a couple of times.  It is great though, it absolutely does not rub off on clothing etc.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> junk, washed off after first shower, left it on overnight, adn waited a full 24hours b4 showering, just junk, threw it out and bought Tan Towels, from Ulta, way better no smell adn no residue to wash off, dont use this junk of you plan on going out and possible getting th lease bit wet, OR sweating, omg, can you imagine the mess on your clothes not to mention the jokes.....</li>
            <li> I would not have believed it but I seen it with my own two eyes this stuff really works!!! It can be somewhat drying to your skin so make sure you moisturize, it seems to work even better.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user/lover of this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, easy, non-streaky affordable self-tanner.  It applies easily, effortlessly and smells FANTASTIC!  Its def a lot cheaper here on Amazon, which is why I will continue to purchase it here rather than in stores!  This seller was rather- impressively FAST!  Ordered it on a Friday and rec&#x27;d it that Monday! WOW!  I mean, for standard shipping (FREE) I couldn&#x27;t believe how well packaged and quickly I rec&#x27;d my stuff! I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE IT IN STOCK!  Looking for a great self-tanner, well, Fake Bake is the way to go... not to mention great seller! -Leslie</li>
            <li> I ordered the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning spray after watching countless review videos on YouTube. Overall, most raved about this product, however for someone who is naturally pale like me ( meaning I have no base tan whatsoever) this did not look natural. I looked very orange just like every other self tanner I have tried in the past. I also found it was not buildable in the least and I had to be completely dry before applying it for the color to even show up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, this was far and away the easiest self tanner to apply. The mitt and spray combination work wonders. It came out very even and I was done my whole body in 15 minutes. If you have a slight base tan already this might work for you. For me it was a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this can be of some help.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very skeptical; boy was I wrong. The stuff gives you a great looking tan which last for days.  Not difficult to apply as the mitt enclosed works very good.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Fake tan without looking fake or streaky and it doesn&#x27;t stink!!  Stays on for several days and dries in minutes.  Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> Is a good product however doesn&#x27;t last more than a day and isn&#x27;t very dark.</li>
            <li> Works great!! No streaking and dries fast. Typical self tanner smell ... Not too bad though.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what you want in a self tanner... It applies (when used as directed) easily, evenly and just perfect!  I made sure to exfoliate the day before and I used almond oil and a heavy moisturizer on my knees feet and ankles minutes before applying the product. I only used it on my legs and it looks great. For reference I have an odd combination of skin traits I am very fair because I spend most days inside but I have a very yellowy-green olive complexion... This (both with 1 then 2 applications ) looks fairly natural and golden not orange. The smell I find quite pleasant and is just tropical not sickly sweet. The mitt makes for easy application and washes out easily with a little baby shampoo. I followed many tips from previous reviewers and would agree that with proper application and a little common sense this stuff is wonderful..... The only thing I have trouble with is keeping my legs dry for hours as it cures....  Doing it at night is deffintly the way to go... And I have very very light sheets that show every toddler finger print but this did NOT run off on to my sheets... Which totally shocked me. :) I will deffintly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this self tanner! For best results shower and exfoliate and apply. I usually keep it on for 12 hours before I shower. I use 2x a week and I love my color! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fergie Ferg Glamorous</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best self tanner available hands down! Due to turning 39 and the effects of tanning becoming more noticeable on my face and chest at an ever increasing speed, every year I spend a few hundred dollars buying all the number one, two and three top brands on the review lists. It seems like I have tried this brand before but it wasn&#x27;t a spray, maybe a lotion? I always just end up with a cabinet full of useless, smelly lotions, mousse and sprays and end up back in the tanning bed. That will not be the case this year. This product gave me a better looking, darker color than tanning everyday. I have my own tanning bed at home and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll just be using it to flat dry my sweaters from now on. After reading some more reviews I find out I can even make it better with blending balm I ordered it right away. I didn&#x27;t buy anything extra (ie...blending balm, shimmer something, body polish for exfoliating) just what comes with the kit. I put regular Gold Bond Ultimate lotion on my hands, feet, elbows and knees and I wasn&#x27;t stingy with it. I just used regular soap in the shower with a loofa. For sure use the gloves under the mitt because it dries fast and you won&#x27;t be able to wash it off in time. It was easy to put on thanks to the guide color. It does not smell bad like every other one I&#x27;ve tried. I put 3 or 4 sprays on the mitt at first and then of course thought if 3-4 looks that good then 4-5 will be great. Nope....I have one tiny area that is a little darker where I first pit the mitt down but it is totally my fault. Everything else looks 100 times better. It is a nice golden brown, even coverage and super easy and fast. I did not think about the spot on my back that I can&#x27;t reach before hand so I had to improvize a little and even with the delay of trying to rig something up it came out even. Without a tan my skin is pretty fair, kinda blotchy red for the most part and now I look like I have tanned for at least a month and I only used this one time. I can&#x27;t wait to get a second application on and see how it looks. I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better than it is right now. If anything changes with the wear and tear of day to day living I will be back with an update. Sorry this is so long I just want everyone to be as happy and relieved to finally find something worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> A waste of $20 and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. It went on so well and looked so good, then I took a shower the next morning and I was just as pale as before. I&#x27;ve done it 4 days in a row and the color just washes off with each shower so it&#x27;s a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanning products and the Fakebake is the best.  It looks like a real tan and I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned.  It has a pleasant smell.  I found it worked better if I exfoliated with the Baiden mitt.  I would highly recommend this tanner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a natural looking fade or last more than 3-4 days</li>
            <li> Simply put....Amazing!! I have very light olive skin (due to my lack of desire for skin cancer) with several large colored tattoos. this product allowed my natural olive color to glow through along with not really muddying my tattoos. I would definitely say that if you have dry skin to do your exfoliation routine and very shortly after tour skin is dry to apply the 0roduct...otherwise it is no going to go on flawlessly. My only serious complaint is about the applicator thing...it sucks...a lot.......</li>
            <li> Waste of money, buy the fake bake 6 hour tanner instead. This one (even after putting on several coats) just washes away all the color. Doesn&#x27;t even look like I got a tan! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite as natural as I thought but it&#x27;s a nice even color with no streaking and stays in well!</li>
            <li> I like my skin to not be blinding white, but I&#x27;m worried about skin cancer so self tanners are the way I go.&lt;br /&gt;This one is pretty good. To use it I have to shave the day before I plan to use it (if I shave the same night my legs don&#x27;t get as dark) and then the night of I exfoliate my whole body, put on in-the-shower lotion and spray my knees and elbows with body oil. I then pat dry with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t go on as dark as I thought it would based on reviews, but you can see where it&#x27;s going. To make it darker I just spray a lot on the mitt. I can get everywhere on my own except for my back so I make my husband help. I use this one on my face too, I spray a light amount on a foundation spounge and rub it on in circular motions making sure I get my hair line and under my chin evenly. I do have to wash my face a couple times a day because I have oily skin and so the face only lasts a day. I also have to use a good face wash or my face will break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the tanner is dry on my whole body I get dressed in my pjs and go to sleep. It doesn&#x27;t transfer to my sheets or clothes and I find it to be a pleasent smell. In the morning I rise off the extra, but I don&#x27;t scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pale and I don&#x27;t think the color is that dark, to get the color I really want I have to do two applications. The color starts fading after a couple of days and in some places I do feel like it fades blotchy and makes me look dirty so I have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product, but I haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s the answer for me yet. I just bought the instant wash off tanner to use on my face daily. I&#x27;ll update my review once I try it.</li>
            <li> I know the box says you&#x27;ll get darker with more applications, but I only see subtle changes each time.  The color also starts to fade much more quick than the fake bake lotion.  It also is blothy after a day or two without reapplying and is lighter in dry areas.  Exfoliation is definitely needed. I really prefer the lotion because it gets me a darker color.  This color is very natural looking though.  I dont find that this product will get someone \\&quot;beach-ready\\&quot;.  The color I get is a mere sunkissed look.  I&#x27;m going to try fake bake Xtreme and see how that goes.  This is a great product to use in the winter time, but not enough color for the summer.  I dont mind the smell, it doesnt streak, doesnt come off on clothes.  Overall good, just not quite for me</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have ever used, and boy I&#x27;ve used my fair share! It was so easy to use, fool proof! And the color was just perfect- not orange, not streaky, not a weird unnatural bronze- it was absolutely natural looking. I&#x27;m so so so happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how easily it applies and it does look natural and nice color.  It in my opinion is well worth the money especially when compared to what it costs to get a spray tan.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Tried it for the first time today &amp; it worked perfectly! It shows up instantly as a faint bronzy tan but then as the hours pass it starts to slowly darken! &amp; i also use tanning face cloths by another brand for my face, i don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on face even though it says its okay. No streaks, blotches, or orange color. My skin time is medium beige, i&#x27;m not pale but i&#x27;m not tan either, i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s super fair skinned only because i am not sure how it&#x27;d react.</li>
            <li> I purchased a fake bake product on groupon one time and fell in love. I went without face tanners for awhile until I thought - I need to start tanning my face a little in these winter months. So I did some research and came right back to fake bake! Bought the spray and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I spray on the glove (soft side) and scrub lightly (but quickly). It tries FAST and will leave some streaks if you don&#x27;t rub in right away! But I like how it dries so fast, I don&#x27;t want to wait around before dressing ! Love it!</li>
            <li> Friend ordered this product and it looked very good on her.  So my wife decided to try it and it has turn out very well for her.</li>
            <li> So I absolutely love this product only issue is my lil put on mine way too dark n much and I had to let sit than rinse off don&#x27;t scrub just Luke warm water and all wet and out. It does bleed off on sheet but all around I love this product already purchased 2 more bottles!!!</li>
            <li> Its just okay would not buy again</li>
            <li> I just received today and tried it almost immediately, I have been so excited to see my results with all the awesome reviews I have read, and I can say WOW!!!!! I LOVE the sun and love being tan, but as we all know, it&#x27;s not great for the skin. This product was so easy to use almost foolproof really. It&#x27;s fast too, took less than 15min to apply all over, and I seen the results instantly. It smells so good, like tropical tanning lotion, not some weird chemical smell. I had spray tanned at a salon, but it never compared to the real thing, so I would always go back to tanning beds and sun bathing. Spray tanning at a salon was always a hassle with the long wait, the high cost, and it rubbing off on everything. This product dries very fast and so far it stays put on my skin and not on my clothes. I&#x27;m already completely hooked! Will defiantly be buying again and again. No need to bake in the sun when you can get the same color in less time and less wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> loveee this self tanner. i have used a million self tanners and this one is by far my favorite. It is completely streak free, doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes because it dries fast, and you don&#x27;t smell weird after its settled in. Plus this one bottle will probably last me through the whole summer</li>
            <li> this product is okay, not really what I expected. Kind of hard to get on even</li>
            <li> Omg this is the best self tanner I have ever used the color is not orange and easy to apply</li>
            <li> When I first put this product on, I looked way tan (because of the color guide) and could tell everywhere that I applied the product to make sure I applied it evenly.  At this point, I had very high hopes for this product.  I seriously looked really tan.  But, the next day when I showered, the tan washed off.  There was a VERY faint color remaining--not enough to really notice or to get me to buy this product again.  I used this several times just to see if I got tanner with each application, but nope.  I have used the Coppertone Sunless Tanning Lotion which leaves a much more noticeable tan.  I gave it 3 stars because if you want an immediate deep tan look you can wear this, just don&#x27;t shower.  However, it will rub off on your clothes and everything you touch--especially if you get wet or sweat.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothes or sheets.  But, I was very disappointed that the tan doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> ok so let me say, i am very fair and freckle easily. I&#x27;ve tried almost every self tanner from drugstore to  really high dollar stuff, I&#x27;ve even done spray tans from the tanning salon, They all have looked like crap on me. its always orange, patchy and makes me look dirty . but this stuff freaking rocks. its the perfect shade of brown plus the best part is its buildable so one application will give you a glow, two or three and you&#x27;re nice and dark. i love that its a liquid and comes with a applicator mitt. It dries instantly so its not messy at all, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, and it smells nice like coconut sunblock not gross like most self tanners. I cannot tell you how much i love this.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best self tanner available. I frequently travel and I simply refuse to hit the beach/pool without some color. I have used tanning booths, every self tanner on the market, and expensive salon sprays, and this offers amazing results. I expected something very different. Some reviews said it was a mess, not true. I sprayed the mit over the sink and no mess! It truely dries instantly on your skin, with NO horrible odor usually associated with self tanners. I was not a fan of putting it on before bed but it does make sense. It does rub off a bit on your clothes but it completely washes out. Which is odd, it pigments your skin but not your bedding or clothes. Great product, my search for the perfect tan is over!</li>
            <li> This fake and bake is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used... And I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands in all price ranges.  The color is perfect, not at all orange.  Looks so natural!!!!! Another super plus is the smell!!!! It doesn&#x27;t have that rank self tanner smell, it&#x27;s the best.  One thing I will say is that one needs to stand on a towel when applying because the spraying of the product does get it everywhere.  I ended up getting red stuff all over my bath mat.  Other then that, Amaze-balls!!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well, very easy to get an even real looking tan!</li>
            <li> I have fair hair and very fair skin - and this product is amazing! I don&#x27;t look orange or streaky - or unnatural. I have to be careful on my feet/hands/knees/elbows, but that comes with the territory when you&#x27;re talking about a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle (purchased in January 2015) and the mitt is really beginning to pill and leave little chunks of the material on my skin. Next time I&#x27;ll order another mitt to go with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it will instantly give you some color and show the coverage and any spots you&#x27;ve missed. Then it will sink in overnight. It never rubbed off on sheets, bedding or pajamas. Some did wash off in the shower the next morning. The smell is pleasant, but I grew tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;For me it took several days to see a significant tan and to work out any spots where I was heavier or lighter handed. I went on vacation and it lasted several days while sunbathing and swimming in a chlorinated pool.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and I saw results instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that any changes in skin texture such as stretch marks or surgical scars take the pigment differently and also fade at a different rate. Not good or bad - but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend this product and will continue to use it. I have never seen results like this from any self tanner I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner out there!</li>
            <li> best self tanner ever, i&#x27;ve been using it for a year now</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat Fake Bake, works much better than spray on mess I was using.  The applicator mitt is great for applying right where you need product.  Price is amazing ...couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> love this fake tanner, works better than any I have tried and I even quit using my airbrush tanner machine because this is so much better and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my face and I can tell the next morning I have a &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Great for fair complexions&lt;br /&gt;Looks and fades completely natural if taken proper care&lt;br /&gt;Mitt prevents streaking and encourages even application&lt;br /&gt;Is NOT orange!&lt;br /&gt;Overall beautiful, glowing color that creates the appearance of healthy, sun-kissed skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Can fade somewhat quickly, especially if exfoliating (though usually lasts 4-5 days for me). The guide color is darker than the actual fake tan after development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS&lt;br /&gt;Wash your mitt after each use so it will last longer. Rinsing thoroughly has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I spray the tan from a few inches away directly on my skin and quickly blend in circular motions. This technique seems to decrease the amount of product absorbed my the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone desiring a more natural, bronze glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a week now. If you have any dry skin on knees &amp; elbows it will show up as looking dirty. I feel like the tan washes off right away. Looks better on my arms than on my legs.</li>
            <li> Washed off after one day.</li>
            <li> Most of it comes off when I shower the next day. Have to put it on everyday</li>
            <li> My wife talked me into using fake bake. I was very reluctant and skeptical of turning some funky orange color. Hey this stuff works great and unlike some I have seen leaving white and dark streaks it went on fast 15 minuits and two hours later I was actually looking like I had a natural tan. Wore my shorts the next day and felt and looked great.</li>
            <li> This is by far waaaaay better than the more expensive stuff I&#x27;ve used. Goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t turn me orange. I love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s applies easily, looks natual. love the product!</li>
            <li> This is the best spray on tan that I have found.  It has not foul odor and is easy to apply.  The color develops almost immediately and is a natural color, not orangy.  However, if you apply it too often, the color does become less believable.  Overall, a good product for those that prefer to have that sun kissed look without damaging their skin.</li>
            <li> Best product for sunless tanning I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love it and have bought 3 bottles so far. Great color and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> OMG I will NEVER purchase another sunless tanner again!! This was the easiest application and BEST smelling!  I have used many self tanners before--creams, towels, sprays--and this blew my mind.  I was able to do it myself and it really is streak free.  The price is making my wallet happy and now I won&#x27;t be translucent for the summer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great for nightshirt works that sleep most of the sunshine days!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is a liquid that I can add to my facial moisturizer before applying.  So I don&#x27;t use the mitt and I can&#x27;t rate it for all-over-body use (I use ALBA or some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand for body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned (choose not to tan) with some freckles, I have more of a pink complexion and regularly have a few blemishes.  So I wanted something that doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen (I will mix in a sunscreen if needed), is non-comedogenic, and rather than using it instead of my special acne controlling moisturizer, I can mix it in.  So far so good.  I mix about one squirt with my moisturizer and apply it to my face, neck, and chest.  I was worried about the fragrance, but it is very light and isn&#x27;t too floral or obnoxious.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I have used it a couple of days in a row, I notice that the color builds, even when I clean my face with a gentle scrub.  So if you are pale, or use more than one squirt you may get dark quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 years now. No one realizes that my glow is from a bottle. Well..there are a few girls in my office who have asked me where my complexion comes from ( thinking it was heritage) I told them about fake bake and now they all use it to. Looks great and goes on easy, no streaks!   Edit: Also smells good! Every time I put it on around my boyfriend, he tells me how good I smell. Which, if you&#x27;re a spray tanner you know how much spray tan usually stinks. Not fake bake though. Smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply and it sprays on with no mess! It is a nice brown color on my skin and best of all no sunburn!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how fabulous this product went on. No streaks, great color, dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Self tanners never smell good !! But fake bake does ,,did not get on my hands at all which is a +..my husband said it made my skin look even and smooth! The price is good !! It will probably last me a month,  the other that I use would last about 2 weeks which I had to keep applying every day, which did not smell good !!</li>
            <li> best self tanner out there</li>
            <li> Love Fake Bake it&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this before based on Amazon reviews and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good color, although spray application tends to be drippy/messy</li>
            <li> Great color, but still has a destinctive smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake for about 2 years and I love it! The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other tanners I have used and it will blotch or streak of you don&#x27;t shower before going out in the rain or going swimming, etc.</li>
            <li> My first try at self tanning and this stuff is great--just what I wanted.  I&#x27;m very fair and this gave me a nice all over warmth that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve naturally. Very glad I took a chance to try this.  Finally, no more ghost legs all summer!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply and looked dirty</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! First self tanner I found that has a pleasant smell!! The color is great! It&#x27;s buildable so it doesn&#x27;t show up too strong the first time and you can reapply until you reach your desired bronze! The Mitt makes it so easy to evenly apply! This stuff is great!! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Works great! For someone who burns and doesn&#x27;t tan, this product is a must-have!</li>
            <li> Actually works and you dont look orange.</li>
            <li> I just called the customer service number on the back of the bottle and I gave them the number printed on the bottom of the bottle - the product I received is an expired product. I had suspicions when the product wasn&#x27;t performing as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks more natural than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Warning... This will stain clothing but if you need a quick tan this does the job. It smells better than most other self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the color washes off as soon as you shower which is a big negative, maybe this is why it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other self tanners??? Also, I suggest buying an extra mitt or two, after a few applications the mitt starts to become rough and causes streaks in the tanner. The color is very natural looking. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Applied streaky, bottle leaks and sprays uneven. As far as the glove goes, its very cheap feeling. It was a bronze mess!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. the only thing i can think of that is bad is that you have to apply it often to keep the tan,&lt;br /&gt; but hay, if i tan in a bed and i don&#x27;t keep going i lose that tan any ways so&lt;br /&gt; its a no brainier, this stuff is so much staffer, looks way nice, and last, plus cost soo much less. very easy to use. will keeping buying!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have found. I buy it every year instead of tanning and always get the best deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works very well, great natural color and even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key with this product is to make sure you read the directions and WASH THE MIT AFTER EACH USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, wash your mit.</li>
            <li> I happen to purchase this after seeing a bunch of reviews on the product!!!! I love this product!!!!! It really is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t streak (which is amazing) and it last for a couple of days. You can manage how dark you want to go and it doesn&#x27;t give you a orange tint. Totally would recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Just started using it this week. Easy to apply, fast drying and love the color! Wish the color would last a little longer though. Looks like I need to apply it almost every day to keep up the tanned, darker color. I usually have this funky odor from the other self tanners, but this one is not as strong though, so by far my favorite one. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just as dark as the fake bake darker version. I love this stuff. Smells great and goes on streak free!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!! No streaks.</li>
            <li> Smells better than any fake tanner I&#x27;ve used, but the color isnt that dark after one application. The mitt isnt the best for applying either as the fluff of the mitt comes off on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had a friend recommend the original fake bake lotion and it was not available at the time.  I personally did not like it because it runs when using the spray.  Recently purchased the FB original lotion and love it.  Goes on without streaking, looks natural, smells somewhat tropical.  You  can use it as often as you like, depending on the darkness of the tan you want.  Mine lasted about one week with only 2 applications.  Use sparingly when squirting it out on the mit, it comes out in an amount which was way too much to use at once.  Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Actually shows color immediately, so there is no guessing or missed spots. Has a natural tan color, no orange color at all. Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> I am a self tan novice and this stuff is great! It is very easy to apply evenly. I have had no issues with streaking. It rinses right off the tub.</li>
            <li> It worked better for me than any other kind.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tan in a bottle on the market ...&lt;br /&gt;I posted a review but it went under the face tanner ..  Oops !&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this fake bake spray is Awesome . It&#x27;s easy to apply, has no scent and it looks like a tan from the sun ... Not a tan from a bottle 😎</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if your on a budget and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot. And once you get down towards the bottom of the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t apply well, turns into little balls when you try and apply it so you only get to use a little over half the bottle and then you have to chunk it. And I didn&#x27;t like the way it faded on me, left little brown spots</li>
            <li> Great color, esy application with the sponge thing it comes with, but I feel as though I am loosing alot of the product to the sponge.  The color last about a day or two, even with showering. Each day lightening a little bit more. The more you put on the darker it will be.  It is instant tan.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  I used to purchase at a local store but now order online as I can get two for the price of one at the local cosmetic store!</li>
            <li> Ok first the negative it does have a tanning smell about 4 hours into it and once rinsed off its light but I still smell it !&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mostly due to it saying no smell and when I first applied it I was shocked no smell none it goes on easy and instant color perfect for a night out or quick tan the people who say it washes off the next day are not used to self tanners the only thing that washed off was the initial color block that is temporary just like when bronzer washes off from tour tsnning lotions .I applied at night went to bed and woke up nice and dark ! I showered and still was dark I worked out today and scrubbed the bathroom with cleaners and showered again still dark super easy awsome color ! I exfoliated with a brush prior to using this product and then stood in the shower sprayed it on and wiped rubbed in I also cut the bottom of the lid so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak like some reviews suggested ! Use the soft side of the MIT to rub in not the white side also anyone stating they don&#x27;t get color or it washes off is applying wrong I look like I&#x27;ve tanned for a month in the tanning bed nice brown good color ! love it 4 stars though since it states floral smell and is supposed to have no smell the smell is not bad compared to many other products I just am waiting for a zero smell product !</li>
            <li> It worked really well. I was happy with the results</li>
            <li> Not being able to go in the sun, I consider my self a connoisseur of self tanners. This is by far the best one I have ever used. There is no classic-self-tanner smell, it dries almost instantly, it is so easily to apply, and the color is SO even and does not look fake or orange at all. I just ordered a 6 oz bottle and I&#x27;m not kidding when I say I&#x27;m about to order 2 to keep in my stock. Not to mention that the price is amazing for the quality and amount you get. I&#x27;m so happy I found such an amazing self tanner!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who does not want to lay in the sun for the natural tan.  It goes on nice with the glove and gives you a natural glow.  The smell could be better (smells like suntan lotion), but not as strong as some others I have used.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used! I&#x27;ve done the salon spray tans and used the Neutrogena and Jergens lotions. Posting some photos so you can read and see more about this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried another brand, here via Amazon, [[ASIN:B000RUD6EK GlowFusion Micro-Nutrient Face and Body Natural Protein Tan, Light Formula, 5.0 Fluid Ounces (147.85ml)]] This one worked well although it didn&#x27;t come with an applicator and was a bit more orange/ yellowy. My main issue with it though was that it stunk- badly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, [[ASIN:B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]] has been by far the best of the bunch I&#x27;ve tried! It provides a more natural looking color and goes on easily, following the instructions, which are clear. I get compliments on my tan, not asked if I used a tanner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;m of Southeastern descent with naturally light medium beige skin. I have a bit of an olive undertone when I get sun and this tanner mimicks my natural color after some sun. It is not fake looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely buildable; this can be used daily to build color. Even just one use gave me nice results! Just enough to cover light flaws. If you have any veins that are visible and just want to wear less foundation or concealer, this is helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic! No more stinky faces from my husband, lol (asking me not to use the prior product)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not streaky! Following the instructions by using long circling strokes, it applies evenly and does not look like it is something that has been applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fades nicely! If you don&#x27;t use it for a week or two, it doesn&#x27;t blotch or look like its cracking or flaking away in areas where you bend... Like your crelbows or neck, as spray tan often does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more funky palms! I&#x27;ve used dishwasher gloves to apply other products but still somehow ended up with the dreaded orangey hands. This goes on with included gloves and a mitt. Works great and no complaints!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a blend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows. (The product info does recommend another product the manufacturer makes for this but my oils work fine.) I do not use any lotions beforehand or find that this product is drying to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me more than the ten minutes (other reviewers stated) but I&#x27;m pretty thorough about blending it well to avoid any streakiness. (Maybe more than needed.) Dries quickly and I get dressed as soon as I&#x27;m done applying it, with no issues of clothes wiping it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying the version made for face next, although so far I&#x27;m happy with this product overall. It is recommended because it is said to not show pores like this one does. (Having years of experience in the beauty field, I know facial products work best for the face because our pores are smaller on the face than the body, so this makes sense to me.) It should absorb better on the face. I will update this review after trying that one out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long ways! I&#x27;ve used this product several times over about two months and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in what I received. Excellent value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Smile. Buy with confidence. Hope this helps.lend of my own essential oils, before applying this to my feet, hands, knees, and elbows.

            <li> Fake bake is easy to apply, lasts a number of days and looks natural enuf for people to comment on my tan. Stopped sitting in sun&lt;br /&gt;for health reasons and Fake Bake lets me look tanned without harmful rays.</li>
            <li> For the money, safety and appearance this is a great product.  I do recommend watching the youtube on application prior to using just for maximizing your satisfaction.  This product also go farther than you would think for such a small bottle.  I do think that alternating it with a lotion would be help .</li>
            <li> This is by the far the best and most natural-looking tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. Spreads evenly, absorbs instantly, dries quickly, DOESN&#x27;T stink. Best results are achieved by following the directions and applying before bed and letting it work overnight--personally, I apply it 1 to 1.5 hours before bed to give it time to &amp;#34;settle in&amp;#34; to my skin before crawling in bed. In a pinch, I have also been able to apply this in the morning before heading out and while I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that, I didn&#x27;t look orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least ten different sunless tanners and this is my favorite by far. It really doesn&#x27;t leave streaks at long as you cover everything...which easy enough since you can see where it is going on. I don&#x27;t want to reiterate all of the good comments and tanning tips. I will stay that it still smells, but not as bad as some. I still think it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re comparing this to the Fake Bake 60 minute, get this! I just recently tried the 60 minute version and it gave me hardly any color. I&#x27;ll stick with the Fake Bake Flawless!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products this makes me feel and look great. You do need to apply more than once for desired shade. Keep in mind the color you are seeing will wash off and is not your color, it&#x27;s a color guide. Wash hands after using. I wash my hand mitt with soap and water and let air dry in the shade. If left too long in sun, mitt will start to get Styrofoam dust (over 2 days). Best price here and I always buy a few for later. This is my 6th box of this. I Recommend to anyone, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face and legs. I use it sometimes. I expected to use it more but it&#x27;s good on the legs.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff is wonderful for a light natural looking tan.  I Guess you can do two applications for it to be darker, but I might order the fakebake darker and give that a shot too. But color regardless, this stuff looks SO natural, I am now a huge fan. Will be ordering darker and let ya&#x27;ll know how it goes!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes two people to use</li>
            <li> the glove kind of sucks which was disappointing because the reviews i watched said it was the best part of this particular kit but just during the first application the glove got all nasty and like, matted? in a way? and stuck together? AND they forgot to add the spray bottle top. so I just got a cap and a bottle to pour out the liquid. which ... makes application nearly impossible. i&#x27;m going to have to buy a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the stuff smells amazing and seems to do the job. i wish there was more green tone tho, so that it would cancel out any redness and orange</li>
            <li> Usually I use the spray tan from cvs (the one with the legs on the can), so this was a little bit different. I like the color it gave me, but it would like go in my pores of my skin especially on my chest/stomach areas. It looked like tiny black spots. Compared to my usual spray tan, this one washes off very easily. I took a dip in the water at a pool party and it washed all my tanner off :/. Pretty easy to apply though you just have to blend it fast so you don&#x27;t come out looking blotchy. You can see my results from my before/after photos below</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, was just as described, and it&#x27;s a great product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gives a beautiful natural glow. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell so it&#x27;s hard to find a sunless tanner that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches but this one is perfect, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all!</li>
            <li> Gives a great, natural looking tan. My husband has to get my back for me since I can&#x27;t reach but I don&#x27;t hear him complaining.  Needs to be reapplied a couple of times a week and be careful of staining your clothing and bedsheets.  Don&#x27;t wear white until after you shower next and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> This self tanner works pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, and the color is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many fake bake products and this one just turns me yellow. I have followed all product recommendations, too bad :(</li>
            <li> I have been self-tanning for a long time, and have used just about every product out there.  This one is not very dark.  It looks good when you apply it, but when you shower, the majority of it washes off.  Also, even though I thoroughly exfolitated, it made my knees orange.  I do like the mitt.  I will probably use it with TanWise products.</li>
            <li> Amazing! No other product has EVER worked for me. I&#x27;m very pale skinned and usually look like a freak with other products leaving me orange and spotty. Used this and its easy, even, and smells wonderful. And it looks natural and sexy! Will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking. It develops very nicely over a few hours. Mitt and &amp;#34;guide color&amp;#34; make it very easy to apply. Smells nice when you apply it but still has that self tanner smell the next day which I don&#x27;t love. However the tan is superior to any other product I have used (which is TONS) in terms of color, evenness,etc. No streaking, and doesn&#x27;t turn your &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; areas into orange weird looking spots (knees, elbows, etc).</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time, mitt is great, color is great. Color does not last very long though. I have to use it after ever shower to maintain the look.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it weekly now. Just make sure you put it on at night! I am planning on buying more in the future and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best self tan ever! It looks very natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If you use the glove that comes with this product and rub in consistent circles, it looks natural. I apply every 3 days to keep it maintained. Best product I&#x27;ve found for tans. :)</li>
            <li> Leaves a pretty good tan.</li>
            <li> its ok, I have used some that are way better and some that are way worse.</li>
            <li> love it, make skin soft and give it nice shade of tan. It was very easy to apply, the coat was even, just follow the instruction, shave, scrub and apply some cream or body butter on ankles, knees, elbows...Stays on for about a week before I had to reapply it. Great for fair skin!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It gives you a brown color rather than orange like other sunless tanners. I recommend to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been wary of using sunless tanners. I&#x27;ve only ever used them on my legs because every single one I&#x27;ve used has made me orange and put me off from trying them on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not the case with Fake Bake Flawless. My tan came out looking so natural - I looked like I had just stepped off a plane from Hawaii! Plus, it&#x27;s such an easy product to use! It&#x27;s never streaked on me and I don&#x27;t have to rush to apply it or worry that some parts will end up darker than others. Also, I love the gloves and the mitt concept because I never have to wash my hands and worry about my hands being orange afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend looking up videos on youtube on how to apply this if you&#x27;re unsure because that&#x27;s what I did and never had any problems with it appearing streaky, orange or any of the other issues people tend to run into with self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> love this stuff! i  was a little erie about trying it (afraid it would be splotchy) but it didnt. stays on for about a week. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I spray it at night, I take a shower the next day to make sure my tan has developed and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used Fake Bake before but it&#x27;s been at least five years.  This set is better because it comes with a mitt!  My skin has yellow undertones and the color is very natural looking, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply especially with this mitt!  Just make sure the follow the instructions about doing the knees last as not apply it on your feet!  Since the feet have too many curves it won&#x27;t apply evenly and will turn out blotchy.  Take it from someone who has tried it, lol!  It usually takes about 3-5 minutes to dry completely, I then apply another coat for a darker &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t seen any stains on my bedding or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this one!</li>
            <li> So I feel like this item was advertised with the mitt, but I only received the spray.  Did everyone else get the applicator mitt?</li>
            <li> I know I am one of the many 5 star reviewers of this product, but I give it 5 stars for a reason many of the other reviewers may not know about. This product is amazing for many reasons: it goes on incredibly even; especially if you use the mitt, it has a pleasant smell- sort of cocunuty or tropical like a nice sunscreen, and it gives an AMAZING instant tan. It looks as if I have been on vacation for a week after having applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback to this product is that you feel bronze and gorgeous right away, but some of it rinses off in the shower because most of the color you get instantly is from the color guide. HOWEVER, and this is THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix this solution with a lotion that you use regularly as a moisturizer. This mixture can be applied daily to maintain the initial dark tan you apply. The benefit to this is you can make it as dark or as light as you want, you can mix it with any fragrance lotion and it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you are wearing self-tanner, it is good for those times where you just need a quick instant glow, and your product will last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note, that this is a professional product and you cannot beat the price. I am a licensed Esthetician and Cosmetologist, and this product sells on Amazon for the same price I can get it at a professional beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!! Love the smell, color and the way it fades! Very inexpensive and you get many uses out of one bottle</li>
            <li> I am new to the fake tan world, but after using Million Dollar tan, there is nothing else as good! This product looks great when first applying, but after a day or two begins to spot. It does smell great and has a nice brown color though!</li>
            <li> Love it! This is our second year of using it, the color isn&#x27;t orange at all &amp; the mitt makes application easy with no streaking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly fair so I mixed the spray with lotion, worked GREAT, nice even coverage.  I wore the rubber gloves, did not use the mit, put a good amount of lotion on the glove, 4 sprays of the colorant, mixed it up in my hands and then applied to my legs.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have ordered it numerous times. It always arrives quickly. The product is excellent. It provids a color that many people compliment. I am very fair and so many self tanning products just make me look orange. This product provides a very natural brown look that surpasses any self tanner I have ever tried (and I have tried a LOT). I will continue to order from them. Helpful hints include applying one coat letting it dry and then applying a second coat for a darker color. Also it is important to shave and exfoliate before use. I like to apply an oil on my skin after it drys. The moisture in the oil helps the product to last longer. And finally, waiting Atleast 24 hours to wet the areas where the product is applied helps to keep color longer. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Super easy to use.  Leaves a nice tan without looking fake.  The mitt makes application very quick.  I know lots of people put this on at night but I don&#x27;t generally remember at night so I tend to put it on after I shower.  I spray it right on my skin and blend in with mitt.  On my face I apply to the mitt first.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with how many times a week to use this.  I am thinking on my face every other day and maybe a couple times a week on my body.  For me no self tanner lasts all week.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good tanner if you like sprays. The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s pretty good. It did get me pretty dark. You do need to wear gloves and rub it in, even if it is a spray. I didn&#x27;t mind as long as it got me tan. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a spray. You need to apply it in the shower so the spray doesn&#x27;t get on your floor. I guess I prefer a lotion, but I would get this again if the price was right.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the store was out of the Fake Bake dark lotion.  I figured it would be better since it has a mitt included in the box.  I have to say I am not a big fan of the spray and buff method.  The spray gets on nearby surfaces (hello, white bathroom) and it&#x27;s hard to judge how much you should spray onto the mitt.  The mitt itself is poor quality and has a soft side which you spray the tanning formula onto and a rough side which does not feel good against your skin.  It tends to slide around on your hand so I have to wonder why they didn&#x27;t just make both sides of the soft surface.  Also little pieces of the mitt rub off as you use the product.  I also feel like my color is a little streaky in certain areas, something I never had a problem with using the lotion.  I will use up the product, because it does give a nice color (and it&#x27;s too expensive to waste).  I may need to figure out a better way to apply it though.  Next time I will go back to the lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have 2 daughters and they have very different skin types; one is dark skinned and tans easily, but the other is very pale and only burns. I don&#x27;t allow the use of tanning beds, so this is their go-to self tanner. It looks SO natural on them both and never looks orange. We won&#x27;t use anything else! They use it especially before formal dances and whenever they want to have a little extra color!  This is even better than having a spray tan done because you get to choose how dark to go!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! The moment I applied the tanner to my skin I was amazed, the color is so real and not orange at all, I am brown! I have tried soooo many self tanners in the past and I will never use another one after finding this. I used the tanning beds ALOT but I decided a while back that it wasn&#x27;t the best thing for me and I was worried that I would never find a self tanner that could make me look as good as the beds do..... I WAS WRONG! Fake Bake Flawless makes me look just as good and natural! The scent is also very very good, it reminds me of vanilla mixed with coconut and it isn&#x27;t too strong to where you can&#x27;t stand it. Thank you Fake Bake for this product and I will definitely be stocking up on these!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;ll never use a different brand! I have already olive skin and fake bake gives me an even deeper beautiful tan, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on my skin</li>
            <li> There are some things about this product that are great, so I&#x27;m giving it two stars. Unfortunately, the most important thing we&#x27;re looking for in a self tanner (the color) is not so great. When I got this in the mail I was so excited to try it. It seemed like it was being praised all over the internet. When I began to apply it that night, the first thing I noticed was the awesome coconut smell that it has that just smells like summer. The guide color is very dark, which was great because you really can&#x27;t mess up. You can see very clearly where you are applying, and while this is a liquid, it spread and blended incredibly well, dried amazingly fast, and actually left my skin soft. I did not expect that. When morning came, there were no stains on my clothes or bedding, surprising because of the dark color guide. The pleasant coconut smell had been replaced by that signature I&#x27;ve been using self tanner smell, but not the strongest I&#x27;ve smelled compared to others I&#x27;ve used. Plus, no big deal because I was headed for the shower to wash the guide color off. Once that color was all rinsed down the drain and left as a yucky brown ring around my tub, all of the color was gone. It literally hadn&#x27;t done a thing. So the next night, because it dries so quickly, I applied it twice before bed. Again, post shower the following morning, I&#x27;m left with no color. I applied it three times the next night, still pale. Come on. By that point something should have happened. I am a very pale natural redhead and I have had the problem of getting no color or very little from self tanning products before, but not this bad and some do work. I also took someones advice of leaving the guide color on, but while running errands it began to sprinkle and I ended up in the grocery store with weird looking splotches where the color began to run. Not a good look. I don&#x27;t know if the people who posted pictures are wearing the guide color or it doesn&#x27;t work well on very pale skin or if the bottle I boughtwas old (bought on another site), but it just did nothing for me besides leaving me with a dirty bathtub.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - works and smooths on beautifully for a healthy glow, not orange or 80&#x27;s look.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of self tanners but i never thought in a million years i would find something i love so much NO MORE TANNING beds for this girl i love love this stuff will never use anything else</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great, looks fantastic and really lasts a while when you follow the directions. Very happy with this product. Cant wait for summer so I can show off my beautiful natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> Fourth time purchasing and I will continue to use.  It gives you a beautiful glow withouth the UV rays.  Definitely keep your buff clean though and rinse after each use to prevent it from staining or from getting green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned, and this product did not make me look overly tan or orange! It gave me a natural looking, but not overwhelmingly noticeable, glow! I feel as though it worked with my skin tone and blended really well.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the color, texture, application and smell of this product that I think it&#x27;s safe to say this is the best self tanner out there. After finally giving up on St. Tropez I decided it was time to try another brand. This one nailed it for me! I have a medium olive complexion and this gives much more of a natural tanned glow to my skin compared to the St Tropez. This is a red based tanner which mimics a real tan, even for olive tones. And it blends so easily into the skin it&#x27;s almost foolproof! The one and only con for me is the amount of product you get for $30 and how much is needed to evenly distribute onto my whole body. I am a regular self tanning kinda gal and this bottle is going quickly. As for the actual product though, no complaints. It also fades evenly which is a big deal when talking self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, by far my most favorite self tanner. the buffing glove corrects any mistakes or uneven spots the next day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Gives a nice brown tan. Not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not expect to like this product. I am someone who is very new to self tanning, I have only tried a couple of other brands, and I just couldn&#x27;t quite get the hang of a nice, even tan. And I have to say that after this product, I am a convert to fake tanning. I will probably only buy this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the spray bottle. It is super easy to use. The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged or anything. And I just poked a small hole in the seal to stick the tube of the spray nozzle into and it&#x27;s perfect. No spilling. I put this in my suitcase and it managed to get through two direct flights with no accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy the color. I am someone who is super pale. Probably MAC NC5. My skin never sees the light of day without sunscreen. And this looks natural on me. It gets me to maybe a MAC 15-20. Nothing super crazy, but noticeable. The guide makes it easy to get the tan even, and it dries so quickly. I can put on my pajamas right after and there is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I wash it off in the shower and voila, I look like a different person. It lasts for about 4-5 days on me. But it also fades very evenly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two downsides are that the mitt is not very good, and that is does stain. But both of these are easily solved. I just wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt to bed. Plus if it does stain, it also washes out super easily. And I just bought a separate mitt. The best rated on on here, thats like $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very solid product.</li>
            <li> Love love love and oh so natural!</li>
            <li> Perfect plenty to do whole body several times</li>
            <li> OK so I love fake Bake. I worked at a large chain tanning salon and I used to spray tan about once a week. This product is very similar to a booth spray tan. The color Is brown, not orange. It&#x27;s best to spray before bed and let your color process while you sleep, then shower in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t transfer to bedding either.  I like to go back and forth between &amp;#34;fake bake flawless&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fake bake airbrush.&amp;#34; I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product it looked like I had been at the beach for a week and didn&#x27;t leave the orange look like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> Bought this last year and just now opened it. I really doubted it would work, I&#x27;d forgotten about it, found it the other day and OMGOSH. I cannot believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on this. I mean, I exfoliated in the shower the first time, dried off completely, and really worked the spray in well. I sprayed the mitt and just kept going from bottom to top. You really need to make sure you rub it in nice and even but holy cow. I had a beautiful bronze glow the very first time. After 3-4 applications in a row (only exfoliating the first time) I had what I will call my new, permanent color! This stuff is amazing! I will say that I shower for the second time about 4-5pm and I put it on them and it stays on until the next morning. I think that&#x27;s key, to leave it on for as long as possible. Doesn&#x27;t stink and it is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is truly FLAWLESS!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now, all seasons, and my tan doesn&#x27;t look orange or yellow. So easy to apply. I wear sunscreen everyday so my natural color is WHITE!!! But I want to look tan and I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years and this one is by far the best. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this product.  The color is very natural, even for a pale-skinned redhead such as myself.  No funky odor like other self-tanners.  Easy to apply and dries super fast. I can get dressed within 10 minutes of applying.  It gives you an instant natural-looking tan with the built-in bronzer so you don&#x27;t have to wait hours for color to develop.  The only negative I can say is that most of the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; washes off during your next shower so I have to reapply several times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been self tanning for years and tried them all. Self tanning.com rated Fake Bake Flawless in it&#x27;s top ten and I couldn&#x27;t agree more. This is the best tan I&#x27;ve ever had ! The price of the product per ounce is Great and the Results are Even Better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Applies evenly and does not stain clothing!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love fake bake Flawless! I am buying my second bottle now. I know some other users commented on how it leaks out of bottle. I tried this trick and it seemed to work-&lt;br /&gt;I kept the silver seal on and poked the plastic spay pipe through it, so the only fluid that was coming out came out as you sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;You must exfoliate. I have put on in the morning and at night. I prefer nighttime, but the color guard looks nice too and I&#x27;ve worn that to work.When you rinse off, the color guard washes off- but a beautiful golden tan stays behind. I try to reapply every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> this is the best tanning lotion I have tried&lt;br /&gt;its streak free, and covers well, with natural&lt;br /&gt;cover and color, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The best self tanner out there with the most real looking color.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but seems to go pretty easy.  Did leave some minor streaks.  when applying it is not that dark so as you rub it in you can&#x27;t tell where you have missed or applied too much to one particular area</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and this is my fav</li>
            <li> I have been catching up on writing reviews all night, hopefully this will help!  EXCELLENT product, one of the best I&#x27;ve used and I have used self tanners since they came out.  Perfect color every time, lasts all week for me, easy to apply and unbelievably natural looking.  No one can ever tell I use self tanners, they are always shocked when I tell them.  The key is in prepping your skin and using a make-up sponge for your feet/ankles/hands.  The mitt is great for the rest of the body and mashine washable.  I even throw mine in the dryer. Oh, I do cut the applicator on the sprayer like another user mentioned, it does leak. They  need to work on the bottle/sprayer, but I have ordered this 3x and will order again.  I would also recommend Body Drench, but I think I like this even better.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well ,but washes off quick</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Make sure you exfoliate! If you don&#x27;t it will not go on smoothly! I have to put this on several nights in a row to achieve the color I want. However the color you get from this product is wonderful...will continue to buy from now on. Very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Strong smell that&#x27;s not good for sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend scrunching the mitt before you start scrubbing your skin with it. Will blot spot.&lt;br /&gt;Worked really well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fair skinned Asian and wanted just a little bit of tanning. One session of it worked and lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> Awesome, wonderful, and great!  Used to use fake bake mousse and loved it, but this is even better because the tan really lasts --  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, even, natural color.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, just don&#x27;t own white sheets</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Best tanning product out there. Most natural. I&#x27;ve tried many many tanning products.</li>
            <li> great product! nice color but stains way to easily</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake! As a pasty white gal, I get a great NATURAL looking tan that doesn&#x27;t make me look rusty or streaky. I&#x27;ve used both the Fake Bake and the Fake Bake Darker in the grey bottle. Both give a beautiful tan, but on my light skin, I found that the original works better. The darker sank into the pores on my legs whereas I didn&#x27;t notice this problem with the original Fake Bake. I apply twice per week and maintain with L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze Daily Moisturizer. Great Combination!!! I always gets tons of compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated user of St. Tropez mousse self tanner since I was able to buy it through a retailer - but it becomes a bit expensive once compared to other self tanners, so I decided to give this a shot.  I was very skeptical, since Alcohol SD is the second ingredient, and it advises against any lotion.  I was seriously concerned that my skin might feel so tight by the time morning rolled around that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it for me...however!  Once I exfoliated (since i live in Utah where it&#x27;s extremely dry AND have very dry skin, this step is always frustrating, since i cannot ever seem to get every piece of dry skin off of my legs, but I digress.  Point being: I scrubbed as much as I possibly could), I rubbed lotion into my elbows, knees, feet and hands, then sprayed this onto the mitt and applied it onto my legs, working upwards.  I was a bit worried first because the tanner really stuck to any pieces of dry skin still stuck on my body, so my legs looked weirdly blotchy where I wasn&#x27;t able to get the dry skin off completely (and believe me, I really tried - again, i have crazy dry skin).  I got dressed in a long sleeved black shirt and darker colored leggings and went to bed.  The next day, I didn&#x27;t have time to shower off but I wasn&#x27;t bothered whatsoever, since NONE of it had transferred to my sheets during the night OR the clothes I had slept in.  Also, once I woke up, my skin did not hurt like it usually does if i don&#x27;t use mass amounts of lotion; i still put lotion on, which seemed to even the bronzer out that would&#x27;ve been washed off if i had chosen to shower, and the blotchy pieces of dry skin blended in more.  During the day I was in 100+ temperature, so of course a lot of the tanner transferred to my clothes (I choose a black dress, so i wasn&#x27;t too concerned) but that night I threw everyting in the washer and it ALL washed off - no problem.  Once I showered, my legs became totally even and I was still left with a nicely tanned naked bod.  After a few days it did start to rub off - but it was more when my skin was dry and got flaky, or if I exfoliated.  No big deal, I just repeated the process, and was beautifully tan again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend washing the mitt after every application - I throw mine in the washer and dryer, and no problems yet!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about staining clothes, it washes out of any clothes you may get this on if you aren&#x27;t able to shower (or choose not to if you want to keep the bronzer on for a stronger tanned look, which I recommend as long as it&#x27;s within controlled temperatures).&lt;br /&gt;Unlike St. Tropez, this stuff doesn&#x27;t rub onto your sheets - I sleep in white sheets and there was never a problem, although the next night you definitely can smell the self-tanner where you slept (although it&#x27;s much less than other self tanners, like St. Tropez, leave you with).&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when you apply the color onto your wrists, since you want to blend it into your hands...it can get a little tricky to create that blended effect.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the color this gives my skin, although i prefer the results of St. Tropez more (note: I do not prefer the smell, annoying transfer to all clothes and anything you touch, etc, of St. Tropez - the color was the only thing I liked a bit more).&lt;br /&gt;Obviously if you have dry skin, expect to look a bit blotchy after showering or exfoliating, but I&#x27;ve been able to remedy that by popping a bit tanner into my lotion that I use post-shower when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind - this is self tanner!  Not magic!  There will always be drawbacks, but so far, Fake Bake has been a surprisingly great product and I am even more happy that it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply.  The only problem I have is the hard to reach areas on my back.  I like it much better than a spray tan... looks more natural and wears better!!  I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Does not leave you looking orange like the ones in the store does. This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trying every item in the store I could get my hands on, a couple of friends told me about this product. After having a couple of Basel carsonoma&#x27;s cut out of me from sun/tanning bed damage from 30 years ago, I thought I would try it. I have been out of the tanning bed for about 8 months now. I wish I had bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and I do not tan, I burn, so I was excited to try this and all I can say is WOW! this stuff is amazing, it does NOT look orange at all, it looks very natural and it smells great!!! I will definitely be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> Can get streaky if you don&#x27;t apply with care.  It washes off pretty fast too.  I would purchase the tanner especially made for faces if you plan on putting tanner on your face.</li>
            <li> Hands down best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m whitewhitewhite and this gave me a wonderfully natural, non-streaky color.  It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t smell bad either.  Like all fake tanners, it will fade after a few showers, but it&#x27;s easy enough to apply that it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few months and I&#x27;m addicted! I have been laying in tanning beds since I was 15, but with skin cancer rates on the rise, I decided to try sunless tanners. I&#x27;ve used almost every other fake bake product, the airbrush, mousse, gel, body butter. I found things I hated about all of them. But Flawless is perfect! I get an even tan, it&#x27;s easy to apply and it has a great, subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Ok after a month I FINALLY received this product. I almost canceled my order but now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. I used a scub on my legs. (was afraid to do my arms until I seen if it was gonna streak.) All I can say is WOW. I used 2 pumps and for each section of my legs. 2 for the front shin area 2 for the calf area 2 for the front of the thighs 2 for the back. 1 for the foot, ankle, knee and back of knee lightly. It was perfect NO STREAKING !!!! It wasn&#x27;t very dark after it dried. I used it on my daughter and applied it twice she had a very nice light brown (base) tan. It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. I will be using this all summer long. I have had skin cancer so no more tanning beds for me. I will try to find a local store to get it from. I don&#x27;t wanna wait another month to get a another order it is summer time gotta have that tan !!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been using self-tanners since I was in the 6th grade, which is um 10 years ago. Needless to say I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. From high end like Clarins to Neutrogena and random overseas ones like Sienna Sol. And my god. Never ever have I gotten such amazing brown natural color! Never! I think it even looks more brown and natural than when I use tanning beds, (I think that means I&#x27;m a naturally orange-tan person?). The product is sooo easy to apply, virtually impossible to get streaks. Of course I&#x27;ve noticed the more you put on the easier it is to spread around and blend like as in spraying your whole arm, not just your forearm. There is definitely a smell, not immediately but afterwards. But its not as strong as other tanners and comes off once you shower, and honestly for the color I don&#x27;t care how bad it smells. It dries super fast and doesn&#x27;t stain anything. And I don&#x27;t know what I like most, the color or the fact that it doesn&#x27;t sit in your pores on your legs like so many other tanners do, or the other fact that it doesn&#x27;t fade like if you have some sort of disease. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, gently exfoliating twice a week and putting more product on, and it looks just as good as the first time. The color fades like a natural tan would, no scales or patches. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that putting lotion on your knees and elbows beforehand so they don&#x27;t become darker doesn&#x27;t let the color sink in at all, so it&#x27;s better to not put anything and just lightly pass the mitt over these areas. I also haven&#x27;t tried it on my face -.- I have very sensitive skin that results in breakouts with any slight change to my facial routine, so I&#x27;m scared to put it on. It&#x27;s not oily at all so I don&#x27;t think it should be a problem but still I&#x27;ve yet to try it. But trust me, give this tanner a chance. I do believe that people&#x27;s skin PH has to do with tanning results, but honestly it is soo worth the try. I will never ever go to another tanning bed or use another tanning brand again.</li>
            <li> The colour is fantastic and the product dries easily.  This claims to not have the typical smell of sunless tanners.  This is true at the beginning as it has a nice tropical smell.  But after appliying the product (especially if applied before bed) the sunless tanner smell will eventually appear.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I want results fast. This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I am so obsessed with it! It comes out super dark but looks so natural if you apply correctly. Great smell and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is my all time favorite self tanner! I&#x27;ve tried Sun Labs,St. Tropez etc. And this is by far my favorite! This came super fast and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered this self-tanner based on the excellent reviews others wrote and tried it for the first time today.  All I can say is WOW!  Not only did it give me a gorgeous golden brown tan, but it is also extremely easy to use, very lightweight, and smells great!  I love that it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and dried almost instantly.  I&#x27;ve already called several people and recommended this tanner.</li>
            <li> So I got this product pretty quickly and I read a lot of reviews on this before purchasing... so I had my lovely husband help me apply this on and I must say, I look like I just stepped out of a tanning bed or had a long day in the sun without burning. Wow. So far it looks really good and natural. I don&#x27;t look orange at all! I applied it to my face as well and so far it looks good. I guess I&#x27;ll find out later or tomorrow morning if it has made me blotchy or broken me out but if so I will definitely write another review which I plan on doing anyway. But so far I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to use tanning beds or a crappy self tanner that turns you orange. 5-  stars!!</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T TAN OR LAY OUT UNDER THE SUN. THIS IS THE BEST SELF TANNER FOR ANYONE WHO SELF TANS. NICE COLOR. NOT ORANGE LOOKING. LOOKS VERY NATURAL. WILL ORDER SOME MORE AS SOON AS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Best self tanning solution on the market!</li>
            <li> works well. but not sure yet if i would buy again because of some of the other reviews and youtube posts.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible experiences with self-tanners in the past, this one is amazing. The mitten helps you see where you have put it on so you know you won&#x27;t have any streaks. I am very light skinned and this works great for me. The price is pretty great as well! I actually just ordered the &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; version by FakeBake because I love this so much. The original gives a nice tan, I am going to be in a wedding which is the only reason I want to be darker. The tan is natural and not yellow. I did have an issue with it staining my sheets, not sure if it will come off in the wash or not because i just noticed that my sheets are covered in spray tan. But the color is great and I would highly recommend. I had no orange streaks, only a nice even tan--it even worked great on my face!</li>
            <li> I liked the product. I am not a huge spray tan person and have been a regular tanning bed user but thought maybe I would go this route as it is safer. So it does go on really well, love the mitt it help tremendously. Make sure you use some kind of lotion on your feet,ankles elbows so you don&#x27;t streak. It lasts well also. I didn&#x27;t get really dark so may go with the dark version next time?  Now here is where I think this is funny. I used this and like it but thought I would try a spray tan from a local salon. HATED it  lol I was streaky and blotchy and will definitely go this Fake Bake route again.</li>
            <li> First of all I think a review only works if you know a little background history of the person that used it. That being said, I&#x27;m a guy. Now I know what you&#x27;re thinking, &amp;#34;What the heck is a dude using this for?!&amp;#34;  And yes this is a reasonable conclusion to think, but first let me tell you, I have a medical skin condition. First, I am a very fair skinned person. The sun always burns me no matter how much sunscreen I lather on myself. I&#x27;m just destined to be a red person. But that isn&#x27;t my medical condition at all, I have Ichthyosis. If you&#x27;ve ever had this condition you know first hand how embarrassing it is to walk around looking like a scaly red dragon all the time. So, intro my history of fake tanners. I have tried light spray tans, tanning lotions, pills you name it. I&#x27;m not a vain person, but all I want is to hide the cracks and scales; not look like a walking sweet potato. The Fake Bake product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t streak like the lotions do. It doesn&#x27;t turn you into and orangish color like spray tans do. And most importantly you can control the amount of tan you want. It stays in your skin like a deep oil. The spreading mitt was also a great idea and keeps the tan looking even and smooth. So far I have had no problems and my cracks and scale are hidden. I plan on sticking with this until I outgrow the Ichthyosis or find a cure! I hope this product works for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> I am so white I glow and after just one use of this i am golden , glowing and not orange ! I love this product so much . I put the mit in my bathroom sink and let it soak and wrang it out and it didnt stain my sink. It didnt stain my towels either. I will be purchasing another bottel to have on hand at all times. This is perfect to use for the instant looking tan and it really dose dry fast . Within 4 min it was dry. I know this bc i was listening to a song that was 4 min long and it was dry by the end. I STRONGLY recommend this product. And i never write reviews.</li>
            <li> Finally! A product that lives up to the marketing messages on the package. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it! Color looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last summer and never had the chance to use it. This spring, I thought to myself, instead of looking so pasty for the all of spring and most of summer, maybe I should give this a go. First off, you want to make sure you exfoliate with a product that does not leave an oily residue because if you use this after that, it dries in an odd mottled coloring, almost like you have a rash or something. I know Fake Bake makes their own exfoliant, but I have never tried it. I normally just use those scrubbing gloves and it all works pretty well. You definitely want to do this at night. Even though it was fast drying (which means you need to work relatively fast) a lot of the color comes off in the shower. Not so much that you get no color, but enough that I need to use it three days in a row before I get the color I like.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply, especially with the mit that comes with it. To get an even coverage, I put some Vaseline on my knees, ankles, a little bit of my hands and feet and my elbows. I also use this on my face, but I just use the leftover on the mit from doing my body and dab it on my face for a little bit of color. Overall Fake Bake Flawless has even coverage, is easy to use and has decent color payoff.</li>
            <li> When I received this, it had leaked. They exchanged it no problem (thanks amazon) however, I went a head and bought the fake bake cream I normally buy. I could not tell you if this product is better but I was scared it would leak again.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Big and soaks up the pee without much odor</li>
            <li> Excellent! ! Love this product!  Almost done with my first bottle and going to buy another!!&lt;br /&gt;The MIT helps so much.&lt;br /&gt;The color guard makes sure you don&#x27;t mess up.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great for the first few hours. I put it on before bed and it smells delicious.  By morning it smells like fake tanner but that smell goes away instantly after you shower.&lt;br /&gt;It has never made me orange.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product but biggest tips are exfoliate, do right after you take a shower, and apply in the shower! You don&#x27;t want the color guard on your floor or rugs!!</li>
            <li> Where were you all my pale life!!! I look better with this tan than i ever looked. Love this stuff, its wonderful, recommend it to everyone! easy to apply and the results are simply amazing. So natural!</li>
            <li> If you put this product on, it lasts until I take a shower the next day.  It looks great and natural when it is applied but does not last.</li>
            <li> Have used many self tanners, cheap to expensive. I actually wasn&#x27;t impressed with first application, did second application the very next day and it all evened out to a yes....REAL looking tan! I use it about twice a week to maintain. Exfoliating first then applying to dry clean skin is key. I love the mitt it keeps my hands clean and allows you to really rub it in and even it out. I do wash the mitt so I don&#x27;t get those fuzzies off it. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Its a little messy getting on, but I have had a lot of complements and it looks great. It last 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;m pale as can be, like when in the sun I&#x27;m blue and purple. It prevents me from wearing shorts because im so self conscious about how Pale I am. I burn and turn right back to pale never tan. I can&#x27;t tan either, I&#x27;ve spent and wasted a lot of money on tanning packages... Also have wasted money on other self tanners. Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that isn&#x27;t streaky or orange. THIS STUFF has been a life saver for me, you can see it as you apply it so you know right away if you have missed spots. It&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nice and even and doesn&#x27;t look fake, it looks like a nice natural tan. I&#x27;m in love! Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> Use it a couple time a week.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Not orange, natural looking tan! Easy to apply, and love the mit that comes with it! No streaking!</li>
            <li> As a female in my late 20s, I am really looking at all options to provide me with great skin as I age. Over all I do have young looking skin and I would like to maintain it! Recently I gave up tanning beds, for obvious reasons, but I have very, very pale skin. Although, I do love my fair skin, I personally think I look best with a bronze glow. One of my friends, an esthetician, referred me to Fake Bake Flawless! She swore by it and said it is nearly error free every time. Now, the idea of sunless tanner scared me. I remembered in high school the awful sunless tanners that I tried that left me looking like a walking orange. Fake Bake Flawless really is error proof. Here are some perks I found with using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Color guard: The color guard in this product is pretty good. I saw exactly where it was being applied. The color guard is dark but it does not look fake.&lt;br /&gt;2. Mitt: Easy, easy, easy application! I really liked this mitt! It&#x27;s very soft. In the picture Amazon shows, it is a brown mitt. The mitt I received was a pink, velvet-like material, on one side, and a spongy side (that I never used) on the other. Fake Bake provides the gloves as a protective barrier because they recommend spraying directly onto the mitt to apply (I used this technique), but I found the gloves to be unnecessary. The solution, no mater how many times I sprayed onto the mitt for each limb, never soaked through the mitt onto my hands. It really works well. Also, it is very easy to wash! Warm water and some liquid body wash is what I used and it cleaned up perfectly every time I cleaned it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Scent: The scent was nice! It wasn&#x27;t over powering and it didn&#x27;t smell like tanning solution for me. On the other hand, I feel that at the end of my bottle, the scent was a little more condensed, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it still wasn&#x27;t awful.&lt;br /&gt;4. RESULTS! I love the results I got from this. Golden glow, never orange, and it faded really well! Just make sure you do the commonsense prep work before applying it (shower, dry off really well, lotion elbows, sides of feet, palms, and exfoliate).</li>
            <li> Tans look very natural. Wear offs easily about after 3 days it also stains light colored clothes which can be annoying but it&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Works SOOO good, you have to have time to do this. this is something that you cant put on fast, you need to evenly put it on. it last a few days. unless you scrub really hard when you shower, wont last as long</li>
            <li> Best self tanning product that you apply yourself -I&#x27;ve tried them all! It helps to apply a thin layer of the lotion/barrier cream first if you have really dry skin. Also, to keep your mitt like new every time you use it,  rinse it thoroughly every time you use it,  then throw it in the dryer! Comes out like new and allows you to continually apply the smoothest streak/splotch free tan every time, even with an old mitt!</li>
            <li> Excellent self tanner. Great, natural color. No stinky smell. Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, make sure to wash the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works really good! It says to spray it on the mitten and then rub it on your skin but it works better if you just spray it on your skin :)</li>
            <li> Best self tanner. One application give u just a little glow and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Doesn&#x27;t run off on anything either</li>
            <li> This product is defiantly the easiest to apply! Great color that look very natural and pretty! The only con is that since it is a spray it can be messy because some spray may get on the wall or floor.</li>
            <li> This was amazing! The most natural self tanner ever! I used it the night before my wedding and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Love it.Whenever I feel white and in need of some glow, this is perfect and puts on really fast and easy. Gives that natural tan glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from a pasty white family line, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good fake tan that won&#x27;t make me look like an oompa-loompa.  You know that time of year (Spring) when everyone is transitioning from their parkas to dresses, and we&#x27;re all in the pasty white moon-tan phase together?  Yeah...I love that season...and then everyone browns up.  But I stay in that translucent phase all summer.  ALL summer.  It isn&#x27;t a phase for me, it&#x27;s genetics, so when I saw the results my friend had from this stuff, I had to try it out.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  Now I blend in with all the people around me with normal levels of melanin in their skin.  I can wear skirts without fear of people being temporarily blinded by my lack of color in my legs!  It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to overdo it around hands, ankles, knees, or elbows, just get a damp cloth and put a large pinch of baking soda on it and rub the bad tan away.  Comes right off.  That works for any fake tanning product, not just this one.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried a few self-tanners before and never really found one that worked as well as I had hoped. This one far exceeded my expectations! Has a great natural color, buildable, doesn&#x27;t fade weird (hardly actually), and so quick and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Easy to apply and no drying time. Great color!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried a million different sprays, lotions, airbrush and this stuff is the best. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all! No other enhancements needed.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have used yet!</li>
            <li> Works great even on fair skin. Only reason I gave four stars is because you have to really make sure to moisturize and exfoliate or it can leave dry patches and look splotchy in areas like elbows, ankles and wrists. But overall its great for the price!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it and looks great. Very natural looking tan. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this tanner. Looks very natural. The mitt is great and makes it very easy to apply. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally a fake tan that looks real!  Easy to apply.  Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate and use blending balm or lotion wherever your skin is really dry. I can maintain the tan using it only a few times a week. A little product goes a long way. I can see that I will be saving lots of money because I won&#x27;t be going to the tanning bed anymore!  I live in a not so sunny part of the country so if I want to tan naturally it takes an hour to get to the sunshine, not really a convenient option for me.</li>
            <li> I love this,but after my first apply,  found out Im allergic to it. Would love to use this again but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, the tan lasts a really long time! I&#x27;ve had a light tan left on my arms and legs and haven&#x27;t used it in over a week. I just can&#x27;t get a very dark tan even with several layers, that&#x27;s my issue :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used this product before, I&#x27;ve been using body drench quick tan before this and am going back to that product after this. I just can&#x27;t get a very dark tan! And it easily rubs off on the glove when you blend it in, so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting so much product. I let it dry then apply another layer, but that still just smudges it. It smells great and never smells bad, and I&#x27;ve barely had streaks because I&#x27;ve used the glove and blended in circles carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite thing is that whenever I use it there&#x27;s very noticeable pore marks which never happened with my other fake tanners. I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so liquidy and watery, whereas my other tanners were thicker lotions or a light spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product so I shouldn&#x27;t diss it too much. Other than leaving pore marks its great! I just was hoping for a darker tan, so it would be great for fairer skinned people probably.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles!!! Give you a nice BROWN tan instead of orange.  my one MAJOR complaint is the application mit that it came with. After two to three uses, the mit became so pilly and crunchy and it would not properly apply the tanner anymore. I had to order a new mit.  My advice is to very GENTLY apply the tanner, otherwise your mit will become pilly and crunchy (and won&#x27;t absorb the tanner liquid the way it&#x27;s supposed to).</li>
            <li> I put a little coconut oil on my hair line, eye brows, knees, feet, elbows, etc. then applied as instructed. The color is nice, not orangey or fake looking. Now remind you, I&#x27;m fair skinned...not pasty white but more sickly and transparent in the winter....I get a good tan using 50spf lol. But this color is very natural and works immediately...no waiting. Don&#x27;t be intimidated like I was over using a spray, it really is easy!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the sunless tanners out there. This is by far the best, and least smelly. And you get results immediately. No waiting 8 hours for color that may or may not show up. Something I&#x27;ll always keep for quick summer color</li>
            <li> As others I have tried many a self tanning product. I watched the gal on the u-tube put it on Fake Bake...demonstrating the How. I liked how easy it appeared to be ...and it was.  I am very happy...Followed her tips and the mitt is a MUST which came with it.  I liked the color and I love the way it gradually just gets lighter before you are ready to do again. Rather than that patchy look I got from others. Also how easy touch up is. The blending is great. The way it works on the ankles and feet is great. Thought the spray would be a mess, but no biggy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with a yellowish/greenish skin tone so this product makes my skin look golden. It&#x27;s so easy to apply as long as you shave and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I am finally dark. 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self tanner junkie! I love having a nice tan but am so against frying and damaging my skin to achieve it! I&#x27;ve heard numerous people rave about this product and figured I&#x27;d put down the Walmart crap and give this a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The tanner comes out brown so you can easily see where it&#x27;s been applied it smells great and has an unbelievably realistic brown glow unlike other self tanners that turn your skin a funky orange oompa loompa color! Although the nozzle is a little tricky and has a slight hiccup in the manufacturing ..nothing scissors can&#x27;t fix! I recommend cutting the straw just a little bit so the product can flow more easily. Exfoliate prior to applying and wash your mitten out in the sink after every use and your golden! Literally.</li>
            <li> this self tanner gives a very natural brown tan not orange at all and my natural skin color is pretty white ..also lasts a couple days and doesn&#x27;t look streaky</li>
            <li> Sucked. Made me look blotchy and washed off within 2 days. Ran, made me look dry &amp; orange. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> It works miracles! Definitely gives you that summer time glow! It&#x27;s defienelt worth the buy !! If you don&#x27;t buy it then idk what to tell you</li>
            <li> You would think that since it has a bronzer to guide you upon application it wouldnt leave streaks. It does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanners because I don&#x27;t like to bake in the sun - however, most of the ones I&#x27;ve used have a weird smell or streak easily. The color of this tanner is fantastic, and the mitt that comes with it gives flawless application. It&#x27;s easy to see where you need to apply more as there is a darker guide color that gradually sinks in for a natural looking tan. I was able to put this on in the morning and wear it all day and wasn&#x27;t bothered at all by the fragrance which is a HUGE deal for me. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not great. Its goes on fairly easily without streaks BUT it looks horrible on parts of the body with creases, such as elbows, ankles, neck, wrist, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that frustrates me the most is that when it is on my legs and I shave.... it comes off wherever you shave. So my legs become a different color than the rest of me.&lt;br /&gt;And ladies with larger breast, it rubs off in the cleavage and under boob area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanning products and this one definitely wins first prize. It&#x27;s easy to apply evenly, the color is natural looking and the smell is pleasant, unlike most sunless tanning products. I love that it bronzes your skin as you apply, so you can see where its going and quickly even out the color to avoid streaks and blotches. You get an instant tan! Most products take a few hours to develop. The mitt included to apply the product works great. It&#x27;s soft and glides over the skin easily, distributing the product evenly. I applied the product by myself and was able to reach most areas, but you may want to have a friend or loved one help you do your back if you plan on wearing something that exposes it. I love this stuff! I got a very nice tan and healthy glow after one use. It looks great and I don&#x27;t have to endure baking in the sun or a tanning bed. This is a much healthier option. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless about 1 year ago and have been using it as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; and ordering it ever since. I am a self tanner junkie, so after I saw a lot of positive reviews of the Fake Bake on YouTube I decided to give it a try. First of all, how can you ask for a better price on a self tanner!? This is the most affordable self tanner (glove included) that I have ever used! Secondly, the application goes on very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t dry before I am done applying it yet it doesn&#x27;t smudge all over my bedsheets or clothes once I&#x27;m finished. The smell is amazing, it reminds me of a tropical tanning lotion I used years ago. Before applying this, be sure to rub some lotion on any dry areas..the most common are your elbows, toes/ankles, wrists, fingers, etc. This will allow your dry skin to soak up some of the lotion before it has a chance to soak up too much self tanner (which would have resulted in an uneven tan). I also spray directly on my skin instead of on the mitt and I will usually apply this after I have taken a shower and right before bed..then I&#x27;ll wake up and BAM I am now a bronze beauty! Or something like that. But, seriously, this is a very good self tanner. It will usually stay on my skin for about 4-5 days maybe a week depending on if I exfoliated beforehand. I have tried some of the popular: St.Tropez, St.Moriz, as well as almost all drug store brands and a few other more expensive brands and none of them 1. last this long 2. smell amazing 3. are this cheap and 4. aren&#x27;t a huge mess. Well worth every little penny that this bottle costs!</li>
            <li> Smells good, beautiful color, easy to apply, natural look, good price, all around great product and best i ever tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how the fake bake looks on my skin, and when i tried the flawless finish i was happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;My complaint was the bottle!! It leaks, even when NOT in use all over the box, i had to put toilet paper on the top so that it doesnt bleed out when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;I believed it was a one time thing, so when i ran out of the flawless finish, i purchased it again (thinking this time a better bottle will arrive)&lt;br /&gt;Same thing with the second bottle....i opened it, used it for one application, closed everything off and by the morning the bottom of the box, and the top of the cap was soaked through, leaking down the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a cool shelf away from heat and light, where i keep all my other liquid products and lotions without a problem for years.&lt;br /&gt;Im sticking to fake bake but im done with the flawless finish spray!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Easy to apply and it does not look fake. The smell is not as bad as the others either. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I spent my late teens and early 20&#x27;s managing a tanning salon and tanning daily. I gave that up years ago but I missed that beautiful brown glow but hated the idea of damaging my skin any further. I spent way too much money on airbrush tanning and spray tan booths which yeilded mediocre results. I tried all different kinds of \\&quot;self\\&quot; tanners out there. This is by far the best. I will never ever use any other product. What drew me to this in the first place was the mitt and the fact that it was a liquid and not a lotion. The application (for me) is flawless every single time. It is dry within seconds of applying. The smell is fantastic and it stays fantastic as the hours go by. Ive used other products that develop a horrible smell after a while. This does not. I get a lot of compliments on my tan and I love telling other women \\&quot;it&#x27;s fake!!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve recommended this product to every one of my girlfriends and even family.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite application tip I picked up from a girlfriend is this: Apply the product to your entire body (even the face!) avoiding the hands and feet. Without applying any new product to the mitt go ahead and do the tops and sides of your feet and toes, backs of hands, fingers and wrists avoiding the cuticles. After about 10 minutes rub some lotion on to your feet and hands. This will soften the dry areas and dilute the tanner enough that it will develop a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;It really works!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to see why this product has such rave reviews. It smells heavenly! It had been years since I have tried a sunless tanner because I hated the smell they would leave on my skin. However, this tanner smells like the Hawaiian tropic tanning oil we all know and love, well at least the smell of it any way. I will say this product was very different from the creams I used in the past because it is a liquid brown spray you buff into your skin using the mitt provided and best of all, you see immediate results. The coverage is nice and the color is natural looking on my light skin. This spray absorbs into the skin nicely, even areas I may have \\&quot;over sprayed\\&quot; in my quest for the perfect color didn&#x27;t start to cake. That&#x27;s impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, my sister was at my house the first time I used this and although she hadn&#x27;t exfoliated her legs she begged me to do hers too. She was really excited about the results but since I did both of our legs I could tell my freshly shaven and exfoliated legs absorbed the product better. So don&#x27;t skip this step if you can help it. Your tan will last longer.</li>
            <li> I do like this fake bake flawless, I do! :)&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this is it goes on effortlessly and it does not streak or leave uneven patches especially around my chest area. It has a nice vanilla beach scent and you can tell that the mitt that comes along with this product is made of  higher quality than most. What I do like very much about it is how easy and fast I can get a tan with fake bake flawless. I just exfoliate well, moisturize and just put this stuff on and in about 8 hours or so you will get a nice bronze look.&lt;br /&gt;I just want to mention again how well this fake bake tans my chest area. It&#x27;s the area that gave me the biggest problem when I spray tan, I always end up in uneven patches and streaks! Not with this product though - I like how smooth and even my chests looks.&lt;br /&gt;The tan lasts me about 5 to 6 days and even when it starts to fade, it fades &#x27;cleanly&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> Fake bake is a good product but ive found that it can get streaky and it doesnt have the best smell after the first 4 or so hours of having the product on your skin, regardless of that though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> Watch out for dry skin spots. Do apply lotion all over before the tan. Or tan will darken the dry spots 3 times! Tough to keep my face and hands as tan because I wash my face and hands daily. Will buy again in the spring.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and easiest to apply self tanner I have ever used. I have a small child and don&#x27;t have time to wait for a self tanner to dry or have loads of time to apply it. I have to say it was easy to apply and extremely fast drying. The color is very realistic as well. Definetly recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!! Used according to directions along with other reviews/instructions and turns out beautifully.  A little lighter than I had expected, but ordered one for my daughter who is whiter than white and ordered a darker shade for myself..You MUST exfoliate/you MUST use the blending balm and the body cream is the cream that simply doesn&#x27;t feel like a cream...light and beautifully scented...Also, the coconut scent of the flawless tan is just right, not too strong.  After using two days back to back, i have a sun-kissed tan including my face, without the harmful sun rays.  I would buy this product over and over, and over again!!...oh, I was so excited to use, forgot to do a before and after...will do on my daughter this weekend!!</li>
            <li> My first self tanner ever and I am so please as well as being a bronzed goddes!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, love the results! Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product! Lasts forever and does not streak. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome!! I was pale, German and Irish pale. I do not tan, not in the least. I ordered this stuff based off reviews and let me tell you, I am so glad I did! it&#x27;s so easy and it looks amazing! as several have said before me, I recommend cutting the tube to the sprayer about an inch or a little more so it&#x27;s the same length as the bottle. second, put a dab of baby oil on your hands, elbows, knees, and feet. that way they are not as dry. it keeps them from looking rusty. third, wash your mitt! I apply the tan all over, take my gloves off and rub what&#x27;s left over on my hands, let it dry a minute, put the gloves back on, and rinse the mitt out. I don&#x27;t use soap, just water.</li>
            <li> I really like how this is applied with a glove instead of just spraying directly onto the skin, or a lotion that you rub with your bare hands. This goes on really nicely, and you can see where you are applying the color. It does darken after a few hours but it is a very even color. My only complaint is that I am allergic to the main ingredient in all of these self tanners. This one does not cause my skin to itch quite as bad as the others I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Man. I really was hopeful about this product after reading all the great reviews. I mean... I thought for ONCE I had found the holy grail of sunless tanners--- the ONE product that didn&#x27;t have the DHA smell. I read so many reviews that said IT HAS NO SMELL.... Wrong. It has the dha smell like any other sunless tanner. With that being said.... It does go on very very nicely with the mit, dries very fast, and produces a very nice color. I just am dying for someone to create a sunless tanner that does not have the dha smell. Great product but I probably won&#x27;t reorder - simply because I loathe this smell.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice golden brown, which is the only star this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - Tanner color is only good when it&#x27;s even, and this my friend, is the catch with Fake Bake. The texture is VERY liquid and VERY difficult to apply. I live in New England (which, if you&#x27;re not familiar with Snowpocalipse 2015, has technically turned into Alaska). I&#x27;m white as a ghost by this April and have to fly down to Miami for a bachelorette weekend. Needless to say, a self tanner is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other self tanning products in the past, Kheils is still my favorite but this one looked like a nice option because of the price, 2k glowing reviews, and the fact that it came with a mit. I&#x27;ve used the mit from Ulta in the past and it&#x27;s a game changer! This mit is TERRIBLE quality in comparison to the very affordable mit at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying the tanner I exfoliated one time earlier in the week, and then again right before the application. I did and extra sudsing in the shower to make sure that there were no oils on my skin. I applied a little moisturizer to feet, hands, knees, and elbows to avoid any dark spots. I put the mit on and noticed right away that it was not the same quality--the foam felt less dense than the Ulta mit. I have never used a liquid self tanner before, only a cream. The liquid is a beast..you spray it on the mit and then rub it in but it&#x27;s totally streaky right off the bat. It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t really absorb, but that the liquid stays on the surface of your skin. The mit leaves sponge prints and nasty streaks--places where the liquid is a little thicker and therefor dries darker by morning. I was meticulous and worked in small sections, from the bottom up. I contorted myself and stood still in the oddest positions to keep any creases from drying funky--all to no avail. I woke up this am and have streaks on my arms and feet...god knows where else. I&#x27;m running to pick up some Kate Somerville self tan towelettes to  try and blend out the lines. I guess I only have myself to blame--I got what I paid for!</li>
            <li> this is not what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;i put this on every night after i take shower and when i take shower the next day, it washes off the tan.&lt;br /&gt;when i take shower, i can see the water color brown.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried for two weeks and it doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;i tried other lotion(non spray) and at least that did not wash off the tan.&lt;br /&gt;i probably would not buy this one again.&lt;br /&gt;disappointed. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> As a recovered serial tanner, then serial spray tanner, I have to say I really like this stuff. You&#x27;ve got to figure out the method of applying that works for you,  but from there on its smooth sailing. I was shocked at how fast it absorbs. Looks incredibly natural. They more you apply, the darker you go. Very sunkissed. I&#x27;m naturally a med/fair tone. Lots of gold in my skin. Light eyes and light hair...and this went beautifully with my complexion. So much cheaper than a spray, and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house and get sticky and stinky for a while evening.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful. I WISH it moisturized as well, but that would be too perfect. Always make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the Flawless, because it simply is a flawless application.  I started with the Original Fake Bake Lotion and just recently bought my first bottle of Flawless. There are differences between the two.&lt;br /&gt;Frequency:&lt;br /&gt;-The Original seems to be more of a once-a-week application as it is darker and thicker. I&#x27;d worry about getting too dark if I used Original any more frequently than this.&lt;br /&gt;-Flawless, on the other hand, takes a couple consecutive nights to get it to a darker color, then probably a touch-up every 4 days or so? Probably depends on where you live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;-Original provides the rubber gloves, but you do have to watch to make sure you don&#x27;t leave any streaks.  I used it as a newbie to the self-tanning world and never had any issues.  That being said, I would ALWAYS wait at least an hour before going to bed to avoid the color rubbing off on my elbows/knees/feet/hands/face.&lt;br /&gt;-The Flawless mitt helps for a smooth application, although I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much of it is wasted by soaking into the mitt itself.  Places like my shoulder I&#x27;ve sprayed directly onto the skin then smoothed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;-I never trusted Original on my face due to the thickness and deep color it had. I thought it&#x27;d be to drastic of a change.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve also used the Flawless on my face twice with success.  Spraying on the mitt is key and focusing on forehead, nose, and cheekbones to define these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps those of you deciding which to go with!</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction and I love the product! I have recommended it to all of my friends. For someone with very light skin, Fake Bake gives a nice glow that easily develops into a more bronzed color.</li>
            <li> I have used a few self tanning products but none compare to this one, no more sun for me - this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing fake bake flawless, as every self tanning product has failed me in the past. But I am so glad I did! First off, I am a very pale person. Im blonde and pasty and I never tan! I burn so easily that it isn&#x27;t worth it to try to get a natural tan. And I hate being so....well...white! I have tried so many products to get that awesome bronze goddess glow that every woman wants but to no avail. I almost alway end up looking like an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;  Well no more! Fake bake flawless really looks like the real thing. Im in love with this product! And if you follow the instructions you won&#x27;t have a problem. It was very easy to apply. No mess, it dries very quickly, it has a pleasant smell, and best of all my husband loves my new glow! All around a great product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because all these self tanners turn me orange and they streak. This stuff is awesome! The bronzer guide helps you know where it is and the mitt applies it evenly. I bought the dry oil smoothie as well and apply to knees and elbows first. If you exfoliate first as the instructions say-it really looks good. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It does show on the sheets if they are light when you apply at bedtime but it washes right out.</li>
            <li> Love this product-the low price is just a bonus. The spray bottle makes applying this so much easier. The mitt helps to keep my hands clean. It has a pleasant smell (with little to no self-tanner smell that usually lingers hours after applying the product). The only downside is that my bottle had a leaky top (making it difficult to store in a drawer). Also, the color does not have much lasting power as I&#x27;d like. Since I can apply this easily and often, I think the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> super dark woman, thanks</li>
            <li> favorite tanner  love it</li>
            <li> Love this product just purchased my second bottle. It gives you a really natural dark color and streak free! This is better then spray tans I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. It lasts about a week and I find the bottle last a while too. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great color lasts for a good week on your skin and doesn&#x27;t get all patchy like most!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely is one of my top three favorites of self Tanners now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. Unfortunately, none really keep that great bronze post the first shower (but then nor did the $50 salon spray tan either).  All that being said - I really love this Fake Bake product best of all.  Just resign yourself to reapplying often (but remember the prep - exfoliating and moisturizing dry areas before).  I&#x27;ve found this product to be the best to quickly apply and get the tanned look I&#x27;m after. I also recommend Xen-Tan Blending Balm.  I use this (post Fake Bake application) to smooth out those dry areas - (for me) feet and elbows. This combination works really well for me.  Just remember - patience grasshopper.</li>
            <li> So I bought it but have not used it. There are just way too many of these products to decide what is best. This seems to be one of the affordable higher end workable ones.</li>
            <li> I love this sunless tanner. It&#x27;s the best I have yet to use and it lasts me a very long time</li>
            <li> Easy peasy , best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried. No nasty smell or sticky feeling. Goes on smoothly with the mitt and dries in seconds. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased in a year.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use self tanners too often, but since I had staff pictures coming up I decided to give it a try. It wasn&#x27;t too hard to apply, but I noticed the mitt started balling up and coming apart after my first use. I applied it a few times for a week and was not too impressed. I personally felt like my skin had a tint of orange to it afterwards. May give it one more try.</li>
            <li> Product works great! Easy to blend and isn&#x27;t orange. The smell is the lightest of all the sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried. As the tan develops the smell will come through, but I don&#x27;t really notice it unless I sniff my arm. My only real complaint is the spray application is messy. It&#x27;s hard to get it solely on the mitt.</li>
            <li> I have tried every self tanner, and every tanning method for that matter (ie, tanning beds, airbrush tan, spray tan, etc) and there is not a product that you can receive as great results so quickly as Fake Bake.  I will never use anything else again.  Best part from having a quick, streakfree tan, is that when it wears off, it doesn&#x27;t leave you blotchy like other spray tan methods do.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless saves me nearly $60 a month!  I used to get Versa Spa spray tans but I definitely like Fake Bake products better.  They are easy to use and very realistic looking.  I actually look tan, not just overdone.</li>
            <li> Honestly did not expect to like this tanner as much as I do...being that I am quite fair skinned, my experience with tanners in the pass have not been great but, this product is awesome...highly recommend!  Easy to apply with the mitt included and looks natural...love it!</li>
            <li> Received a defective bottle that leaked all over when trying to spray it! There&#x27;s no way to spray it, the stuff leaks out and spills everywhere! It&#x27;s a ridiculous splattering mess. Yes, the consistency is thin and is that of water but the malfunctioning bottle made it worse.  It got all over the sink, the wall, and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time ordering it. Ive decided to quit the tanning bed after 15 years! and as skeptical as I am of using any sunless tanners after reading these reviews I tried it and im sticking to this one. people say that it looks natural. Ive got my 3rd bottle still loving it!</li>
            <li> Not orange, no streaks , no weird smell, and love the applying mit. Definately good but Tanwise from Sally is just as good and cheaper</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product! I don&#x27;t know how in the world they did it, but this stuff does not have that offensive fake tanner smell that every other product I&#x27;ve tried has had. YESSS! :) Normally I don&#x27;t go for bronzers, but in this case it is a beautiful, light brown, somewhat translucent and natural looking shade that&#x27;s super easy to blend and it helps SO much in preventing streaks! You can clearly see a noticeable, yet subtle, layer of shading go over your skin that guides you to where you need to blend or apply more. Another plus is that using this on your face is a breeze and thus far it hasn&#x27;t made my acne-prone skin break out at all. Immediately after applying it just looks like you put on a dusting of bronzing powder, not too dramatic or too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply this product it has a delightful coconut sent to it, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering (IMO) and fades as it dries. After that I can barely notice any sent at all, which is perfect! The mitt makes it very easy to apply all over your body more evenly than hands alone. However, my only complaint is that it tends to slide off your hand easily if you don&#x27;t keep your fingers spread inside the mitt to hold it in place, but no big deal there. As another reviewer mentioned, I would also highly recommend 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash the mitt gently with soap and water after each application. It only takes a minute and it will make each time you use it a more pleasant experience. And...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The bottle does leak just a bit when you spray it, so simply trim the extra unnecessary length off of the spray tube so that the end just touches the bottom of the bottle. This should take care of that minor leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone who used to frequent tanning beds in my 20&#x27;s and gave it up to avoid skin damage, I can attest to what looks like a natural golden UV tan vs. an orange monster from the tan-lagoon. This product is the most natural look I&#x27;ve ever come across from any gel, cream, liquid or wipe (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes. It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way. It should last you awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try! You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not. It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out. The bronzer gives you an immediate healthy glow. For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately. Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly great stuff... my pale skin thanks you!!ross from any gel, cream, liquid or wipe (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). It also looks great on my naturally very light skin tone, which can be hard to achieve sometimes. It might seem just a tad pricy for only 6 oz, but being that it&#x27;s a liquid you spray on the mitt and then lightly apply, a little goes quite a long way. It should last you awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try! You&#x27;ll know right away if it&#x27;s for you or not. It&#x27;s also great for those last minute moments when you want some instant color right before going out. The bronzer gives you an immediate healthy glow. For an even darker instant look, you can let the first application dry a bit and then apply a second coat for a deeper result immediately. Then after several hours the more lasting color will have developed under the surface when the bronzer eventually washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly great stuff... my pale skin thanks you!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Easy to apply evenly. Isn&#x27;t sticky after application, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes. Also easy to quickly build a gradual tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried million different self tanners, and this is perfect.  I really like the spray.  It goes on really even, and the mitt smoothes nicely to avoid any harsh, discolored areas.  The tan is buildable, which unlike some of the other reviews, I like.  I didn&#x27;t want to look crazy dark during the winter.  I&#x27;ve used this on my entire body, and it is easy to apply.  It is a MUST that you exfoliate like crazy for this product to go on evenly.  And with any self tanner, use carefully on ankles, knees, and elbows.  It took me a couple times to master it, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;I have an orange under tone to my skin, and I don&#x27;t think this makes me look orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Hands down best self tanner I have ever used!  And, Im a Jersey girl, I should know!  There is no orange tint at all. Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Great way to get nice even color.  It does wear off on clothing after application, but after showering the next morning the problem goes away.  Love this stuff!!  Not much into the tanning bed and tried lots of other products...  Flawless is the way to go!  I have recommended this to everyone I know looking for a nice tan without the sun!</li>
            <li> I used this after exfoliating and took my time to apply it with the mit that comes along with it.  It goes on smooth, smells great, and the color isnt too orange. I tried to use it again a second time a few weeks later and wasn&#x27;t too happy with the mit. Little pieces of the mit came off while i was applying it and it washes off pretty quick. It does a good job if you are wanting a quick nice tan but I have not tried using it again. I will need to find another mit the next time I decide to use it. I honestly don&#x27;t think ill even try it again.</li>
            <li> I like this the most out of any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used, but I still get an occasional streak.  I love that you can see where you put it on and the effects are immediate.  If I can think far enough ahead, I like to apply it the day prior to the day where I&#x27;ll be exposing my legs - it gives the color a day to even out.  Nice smell, like the applicator mitt!  I have recommended this to a few friends and they have done well with it as well!</li>
            <li> I am blown away by this product.  The tan is as good as the custom spray tans I have gotten at the salon for $50 per session. I just can&#x27;t go in the sun anymore, just can&#x27;t risk getting sun on my face. Now I can have a tan year round and not worry about damaging UV Rays! This is an unbelievable product and at such an affordable price. THANK YOU FAKE BAKE!</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner that I have ever used! Application is easy and foolproof. Very realistic and buildable color. And one of the biggest perks is the scent! No nasty self-tanner smell; the product smells like coconut! Will purchase this again and again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Just as good as a spray tan actually much much better, looks more natural, cheaper, lasts just as long&amp; my favorite -that one ingredient that all tanning products have that make u smell SOOO bad.... in this product isn&#x27;t that bad at all. As long as I decide to tan this would b the only product I ever use :-)</li>
            <li> I love the color this puts on my skin. Not orange at all. As long as you exfoliate good and put it on evenly then it will look great. When I shower for the few days after I use the product I don&#x27;t use a rag and scrub because then it will come off in certain areas. I just use soap and wash off with my hands instead of a rag. It stays even that way.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and turned out really well. I washed my face after I applied it and woke up with a line that wasn&#x27;t tanned so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and had such high hopes for it based off all the reviews! It has a great color at first, much better color then others that I&#x27;ve tried, but once I showered the next day all the color was gone. I would be open to trying other products by this company based off of the non orangey color but I&#x27;m very disappointed in this one in particular. :-(</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, works great and so easy to apply and leaves no streaks!! Best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Perfect self tanner. easy, fast, and perfect golden color. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this self tanner. I have some color in my skin naturally but I tend to get really pasty during the winter and this product totally solves my problem! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad (to me it kind of smells like chocolate) and I like that it goes on easily and is in liquid form. I prefer the spray over a gel, liquid or mousse because the spray really soaks in to your skin. Gives good color payoff and the guide color is a really nice feature as well. I won&#x27;t be purchasing another brand like EVER!</li>
            <li> Nice but you have to be careful appling. Can really make some mistakes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Easy to apply. Color is good, however, not as dark as expected. But I am pretty pale</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get past the awful smell. I got a bad headache and it made me sick.If your sensitive to smells don&#x27;t but it! Sending it back.</li>
            <li> I came on to do a return and missed it by 2 days. I hadn&#x27;t used it until last week and then tried it again today.&lt;br /&gt;It puts such a light color on you that it&#x27;s not even noticeable. I tried a 2nd application that didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I tan easily but stay out of it now at my age. Oh well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONDY</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this self tanner!! I have tried many products, both expensive and cheap, but this has by far been the best yet. I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues. The mitt that it comes with makes it so easy to apply and you can see the color as you apply it so you don&#x27;t miss any spots. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad for the price.  I do like the glove that they send with it.  I think it helps the lotion go on alot smoother</li>
            <li> What a strange product. I am kind of scared of it!! LOL I made the horrible mistake of spraying it on my FACE and let me tell you, if you have ANY dry skin or healing marks on your face it will grab that color and make you look like you&#x27;ve been in the mud!!!! Don&#x27;t do that!!! This is very dark stuff and when sprayed it was quite surprised that it more splattered from the bottle than sprayed in a fine mist! I&#x27;d NOT spray it on your skin if I were you. Now I&#x27;m afraid to use it and I bought two bottles....this is pricey stuff folks!!! I suppose I will have to experiment a bit. Ugh! I think I regret this purchase immensely. Scandinavian White</li>
            <li> This was a purchase over a year ago so I really do not know what to post on here due to my forgetting, sorry.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and it gave me a nice tan the next day but after the first day there were brown circles around the roots of my hair on my skin so you could realize it but if you don&#x27;t have any hair on your skin I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). Great price too.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as enclosed and it just did not work for me after 5 days. The color was  very faded and spotty</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned naturally, and I am cautious about how much sun exposure I get because there is a history of melanoma in my family. However, I certainly think I look healthier and more vibrant with some color on my skin! I have tried several different spray tans, with moderate success. However, the process of getting sprayed, and having to dry afterwards, and having to be super cautious not to sweat or rub on anything is just exhausting (and expensive!), not to mention having to maintain it so you don&#x27;t look like a dirty, stripy freakazoid. I have tried just about every tan-in-a-bottle as well, from the gradual tanning lotions in every brand, to the $45 St. Tro-you-know-what, and there was always at least one major flaw, whether it be difficult application, unnatural coloring, stinky scent, or expensive pricetag-- nothing was perfect. Until I tried THIS product. It really has everything I have been looking for: the color is by far the most natural and long-lasting and easy to build on; the scent is very nice, and the DHA does net ever smell super strong as your color develops--and the DHA smell is completely gone once you take your shower;  the product is super easy to apply and very forgiving (I&#x27;m a clutz) and this kit comes with 2 latex gloves to protect your hands and an application mitt that completely and easily gets rid of all streaks; and 2 units of this size bottle lasts me the entire bikini season (which is LONG in Georgia- at least 5 months!); it also works extremely well on my face without causing any breakouts (Just use it more sparingly on your face. I have noticed that too much on my face looks a bit ruddy or dirty instead of golden. Just go easy at first til you figure out the ideal amount! I do one light spray on to the mitt, and apply it where the sun would darken my face. Like a bronzer!). I apply it to dry skin after a good exfoliation in the shower, give it about 2-3 minutes to completely dry (it really is that fast!), and sleep on a towelovernight. In the morning I shower, rubbing my skin with just my hand, and do any light touch ups I might need. That&#x27;s it! Couldn&#x27;t be easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, best self-tanner there is. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. This is my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; tanner!!!</li>
            <li> Fake bake was recommended by a friend. I was tired of the scent of the self tanner I was using so I gave fake bake a try. It was a reasonable price and the results are natural and leaves you looking like you&#x27;ve spent a few days at the beach.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product after reading all of the reviews. After the first time using this, I followed the instruction, exfoliated really well, applied evenly, and not only did it streak, but it left really dark spots in my pores. I tried it a couple more times and still had the same problem, My best friend was trying it at the same time as well and had the same complaints. Both of us went back to Banana Boat and Jergens products.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color!!! But comes off patchy, especially in the crease of your inner arm. (No matter how much exfoliation, it comes off patchy in these areas). But best color of an instant tanning product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner doesnt streak but does get on light colored clothes if its hot out and your sweating or getting wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear from the over 1,000 reviews that this product is awesome so I don&#x27;t really need to &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; it. However I will say that I am naturally very very pale and:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;The color is BEAUTIFUL&lt;br /&gt;The mitt is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another tanning lotion again....and I have bought MANY over the last ten years&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so mad I never knew about this sooner&lt;br /&gt;The color guard gives you an instant tan&lt;br /&gt;Drys very quickly&lt;br /&gt;I have fun putting it on so I don&#x27;t mind doing it often&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to have a second mitt so I can have one just for my face&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfection!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Does not smear or come off your clothes. Prompt delivery and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! If your looking for a natural looking tan, this will be your new go to! It takes only a few minutes to do your whole body ( or at least the parts you can reach) dries almost instantly and does not rub off on clothing or beddings . Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve been on a beach vacation ( I wish) since my life does not allow me enough sun time this new bottle of magic gives me that sun kissed look without the sun! Also, applying it to your whole body or most of it uses be very little of the bottle so I think it will last a while. I do it about 2-3 days then stop for a week. After a week do another application and that should bring you the next week. Although I love the sun I feel as though using this is also a healthier option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skin ginger with lots of freckles and this product just adds the perfect touch! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> It was the first time I used artificial tan, but it turned out flawless. Looks totally natural and no tan lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: it is recommended that you sleep with the product applied to your skin, so the bed linens will get dirty. However, I have brown bedsheets, so the stains (if they stayed after washing) are totally invisible. I wash it away in the morning, and I didn&#x27;t see any stains on my clothes, even on white undies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it seems that it dries my skin (though I am not sure if it is the product itself or the requirement to forego your moisturizer the night you apply the tan). So If I had dry skin, I would not apply it on my face.</li>
            <li> All I can say wow what a good color tan not Oregon at all just a good tan color,  and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It did make me tanner  but it only holds for like 3 days</li>
            <li> this is a GREAT sunless bronzer. I have tried 5 star products on Amazon. This product comes with pump spray top and the application mit (with st tropez the mit is an additional $10). No smell that I can detect. You spray directly where you want the product then use the mit to apply in a streakless fashion. Dries instantly. Be careful of over-spray in your bathroom. If you do just wipe up immediately with Clorox bathroom cleaner. Really like this product will probably purchase again</li>
            <li> This stuff does work really well for what it is. Definitely USE GLOVES when applying though because it will stain your hands terribly. Also MUST exfoliate well beforehand, otherwise it looks very splotchy. But what is nice about this is that you can see it right as you apply it &amp; it isn&#x27;t any kind of funky orange looking. It will come off on your clothes if not completely dry &amp; if you get sweaty with it on, it will come off on your clothes for certain. But it holds up well if you&#x27;re doing it for special weekend. It will stay on after showering for the most part as long as you don&#x27;t scrub yourself too vigorously. Really it stays on best if you just wash with soap only &amp; no cloth or scrubber.  I would buy it again. Also I&#x27;ve used my one bottle many times &amp; still have plenty left. It goes a long ways (you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to get desired effect.</li>
            <li> I have used every self tanner under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best I have ever used. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and this product worked great.  That nifty applicator seems to help a lot on wrists &amp; ankles.  Even better, when it fades it doesn&#x27;t leave me splotchy.  I even think the color is better than any spray-tan I&#x27;ve had in past, more natural. Definitely will use again.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this YEARS ago instead of dangerously using a tanning booth. There is nothing fake looking about the color fake bake gives you. It doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange. I can get out of the shower, apply oil to my elbows, then put this on and get ready for the day. I don&#x27;t have to wait. I haven&#x27;t tried using this product before bed, but really, there&#x27;s no reason to. It works right away and throughout the day. It gives you a nice brown color. I have used it on my face. Anyone who is scared to try it, just GET IT! I was too, but with such a low price it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I like it but it dries VERY quickly!  Be prepared to blend it in with your lotion and apply it that way or apply lotion first so it won&#x27;t instantly dry and streak.</li>
            <li> Great.  No problems with this transaction.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, coconutty. I recommend to wash the mit before initial use as it left a dark fuzz all over me. I couldn&#x27;t tell if tanner was distributed unevenly or if it was just fuzz so I was constantly going over &amp; over areas.  It left me sticky for about 1 naked hour. Then clothes on &amp; of to work. No stain on clothes but it dsnt smell nice anymore (7 hours later). It very faintly resembles the scent of other self tanners however, the color is a rich golden, leaps &amp; bounds better looking than other tanners! Very easy use with the mit &amp; putting on was so much faster than others. For the color my tan is, I will buy it again and I&#x27;m buying one now for my sister.</li>
            <li> Great product. Natural glow</li>
            <li> This product if for sure the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used... and I&#x27;ve used quite a few. The only issue is you need to really buff it in good for a solid all over color. I couldn&#x27;t do my backside by myself,  guess that&#x27;s what husbands are for :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several faux tan products, not being happy with any of them.  I tried this as it was recommended to me by my step daughter who wanted to quit the tanning salons and was using this product with great results.  Most other products I won&#x27;t use on my face just because they don&#x27;t go on smoothly and the color is always off.  No problem with this one.  First time I&#x27;ve had &#x27;color&#x27; on my face this early in the season.  Use as directed, apply at night and shower off in the morning or you do have a slightly sweaty smell during the day if used after your shower in the morning, just saying. If you&#x27;re wondering if this works, it does and it gives you a natural brown tan we all want to achieve. It says to use two nights in a row then refresh the tan once a week thereafter.  Easy Peasy.</li>
            <li> great instant tan. but tan runs if u get wet. i used in the summer and got water on my legs and had white areas where water dripped down. it will get on white clothing. when u shower some comes off but you still have a lil tan left over.&lt;br /&gt;this summer im using sublime bronze mouse by  l&#x27;oreal and i think its the best one ive found. also the new jergens self tan (smells like perfume when applying) both have been great products.</li>
            <li> To be honest I usually hate self-tanners, but this one exceeded my expectations. It goes on evenly, dries quickly, and one bottle lasts me quite awhile. Just make sure you rinse the mitt in the sink between uses. It&#x27;ll help keep the product from looking streaky when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no streaks, great color! Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> This self tanner deserves its cult following. Literally everyone I&#x27;ve seen who has had a gorgeous tan admitted to using Fake Bake Flawless. Sometimes this came as a surprise because their tan looked genuine. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products but none gave the brown legs I&#x27;ve been lusting over every summer. With only one application that ended up lasting a good week this gave the perfect color I was looking for. A nice, deep brown with ruddy undertones as if you had really been in the sun that day. My skins undertones are warm as reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color guard (so you eon&#x27;t miss a spot) is a great color on its own and is wearable throughout the day itself without being sticky or transferring (if you really want to be bronzed). It also smells amazingly tropical and never turns into that yucky typical self tanner scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that this comes with a mit for free which is a must with this sort of a liquid formula. It does take more work to buff into the skin compared to a mouses but the color it leaves is worth it. Also I took others advice and cut the plastic tube and have not experienced any leaking from the spray nozzle or cap. Will definitely repurchase but this bottle is looking to last the rest of the season.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand</li>
            <li> Looks good but doesn&#x27;t last.  It will sweat off and.come off in water and dries very fast like instantly so have to rub I&#x27;m fast and also will get on surface you are standing and stain your.feet bad</li>
            <li> The mitt is great for giving an all over even application. smells nice and I do not have that orange look.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I put it on for two day&#x27;s before a meeting I was going to. I could really see the difference. I love that you do not turn orange with this and there are no streaks.</li>
            <li> Wow this little bottle is awesome... It gave me an instant bronze natural color.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box you&#x27;ll find the lotion, pump, two latex gloves, and a small mitt.  First, spray the mitt, rub it on evenly (which I had no problem doing) and it dries right away although you can&#x27;t get wet for about 5 hours you can go to sleep (bed) and not worry about a mess. I definitely recommend it. Oh! And smells good too ( tropical soft sent) :)</li>
            <li> way to fake - it is definitely a FAKE BAKE!!</li>
            <li> Is much lighter than the original and takes several days to achieve what the original does in one. This is much easier to apply and smells great. Great product for very pale skin if a light color is desired.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I am real fair and have tried so many sunless tanners only to be disappointed.  First, I don&#x27;t want to spend hours trying to get it on correctly so it doesn&#x27;t streak, etc.  Secondly but equally as important, NO orange. I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanners pricier than this and have never got the wonderful results I have with this.  But one of the best things about this is the mitt....must use the mitt.  It helps to get evenly without streaking. Also I would suggest putting lotion over any rough patches of skin so it won&#x27;t follow the lines of the skin folds.  This takes me about 10 minutes for my legs, arms and chest which was great.  It turned my skin a golden brown color upon application(not a hint of orange).  I will say the first time  you shower after, a bit of it will wash off but you still have plenty of color left. The smell of it is like tropical tanning oil but after sleeping all night, I woke up and didn&#x27;t notice any scent of it on me.  Also I haven&#x27;t noticed any that has rubbed off on my bedsheets.  It dries super quick.  I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> This works okay - still not a fan of the spray - used the St. Tropez foam - and liked it better! But overall good product... Free mit is LAME... Invest in a better one and you will be happy! The MIT is a must!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a self tanner that did not have an odd odor and gave a nice bronze color that lasted for several days. This one is the one. I especially like the convenes of the spray bottle, gloves and the mitt so your hands don&#x27;t take on a dark color.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get compliments on my tan a lot and I never look orange. It also helps even out in the summer for the areas that get less sun.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product gives you amazing color but it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin. It washes off after every shower so I have to reapply quite a bit. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love taking the sun, but every year, I&#x27;ve become more weary about absorbing the rays for more than a half hour for obvious reasons.  Despite my Italian heritage, I get pretty pale during the winter months, so every spring I start experimenting with various types of sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last product I&#x27;ve used before I decided to try Fake Bake was Neutrogena&#x27;s  Micro Mist Dark;  Yes, that spay on tan. The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as others, but it reminded me of a hair spray smell. The problem with the spray on tan was you had no way of telling how much coverage you had. There was no guide, so you had to spray and rub and spray and rub, so yeah, it kind of defeated the purpose of a quick spray on tan. Not to mention, the results were way too subtle, in fact, so subtle that under certain lighting conditions, it appeared non-existent.  I also tried one of the Banana Boat products, but the smell was super perfumy;  it streaked, it took forever to absorb, it was super messy  and the results were very John Boehner; No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read about Fake Bake, I though the included mitt would be gimmicky, so I always ignored it in the past. This time, I decided to check  all of the Amazon reviews, and I made my choice. Well, I&#x27;m happy to say the results were pretty amazing. The included mitt makes a world of a difference. It helps prevent streaking and it lets you cover huge areas very fast. It took me 1/10th the time to do a full body tan, compared my previous experiences. It dries super fast, so you&#x27;ve got to keep moving, but it&#x27;s worth it, as you can put on clothes without worrying about staining,  or if applied before bed, your sheets won&#x27;t become intimate with your faux color. Speaking of color, It gave me nice medium bronze with a hint of that redness, similar to the tone you get when coming home from a long beach day. In the early evening, I took a shower so the guide did wash out, which resulted in a lighter version of the above mentioned, but still, very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt washes out very easily, and the smell reminds me of the old Hawaiian Tropic sun tan lotion from my wreckless tanning days. It&#x27;s that familiar, cocunut smell -- very pleasant and not overpowering. As a middle aged man, the combo looks great with my salt and pepper hair. Very pleased with this product.able.

            <li> Overall I like the product.  You can apply one night, then apply again the next for a darker color, but if you are really pale, beware, it may turn orange.  Everyone&#x27;s skin tone is slightly different, so I can only speak from my experience.  My skin is very, very pale.  I applied one coat and it made me slightly darker, but not a significant tan.  It still was decent though.  The following night, I applied another and that made me kind of orange, so just as a fair warning, if you are super pale, you might come out a little orange.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Shows a real tan.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I had given up on tanning lotions for years but decided to give this a try solely based on the reviews here. This product is easy to use, goes on well, no smears, doesn&#x27;t smell or feel sticky, doesn&#x27;t stain my bed sheets and looks awesome! I used it one time and I looked stunning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells ok.. Easy to apply with the mitt.. Washes off to easily only thru one shower.  Nothing more ok stuff</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product and try it out. I have yet to actually try it though. The direction say: &amp;#34;Spray the liquid&amp;#34;. However my package did not come with a spray bottle or spray tip. So not really sure how I&#x27;m supposed to use the product when it came without a crucial element for use. Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> This works very well and blends beautifully on my skin. It gives you a great tan and NOT orange either. Looks very much like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun. I would of given 5 stars had it last a little bit longer but for sun in a bottle it definitely does the job! And easy to apply!!</li>
            <li> I know the product is great. . But had leaked and was no good by the time I got it.  Returns are going ok so far.</li>
            <li> I was in a friend&#x27;s wedding when I was 7 months pregnant and needed some color for the one-strap dresses.  This product worked perfectly.  I looked and felt great.  I&#x27;m fair skinned so I practiced a few times leading up to the wedding.  Had to put it on a few times to get color and then just about once every 5-6 days to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I am a skin cancer survivor who is serious about my sunless tanning and this is one of the most natural looking glows out there with a very subtle and unobtrusive scent.  The tan is just warm enough, just cool enough. I skip the applicator mit (if you use it, be sure to wear a glove inside of it or you&#x27;ll be sorry) and use an extra large flat kabuki brush to buff on the color. Looks like I just came from the tropics every time. I also use St Tropez and like this one as a day to day application, St Tropez for a once a week punch.</li>
            <li> This product does work great and I had a beautiful warm and natural appearing tan for our vacation while completely protected from the harmful sun with SPF 70 (by the way I am fair skinned!).  I applied an hour before bed and found the smell from it on my face overwhelming (I&#x27;m sensitive to odors) and had to get up in the middle of the night to shower. The next time I use it I&#x27;ll apply in the morning and shower 6 hours later.  It works too well to give up on!!</li>
            <li> The weather has turned warm and my ghostly white legs were just not ready to see the light of day so I needed to find a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several - from drugstore brand to a QVC product to the Clarins brand sold in department stores  (Which is very good but just too much money to spend on self-tanner).  So after reading the positive reviews on this one, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving and exfoliating and donning latex gloves, I sprayed the Fake Bake onto my legs.  I didn&#x27;t use the mitt because I&#x27;ve heard it leaves streaks but who knows?  I did put a small amount of moisturizer on my ankles &amp; knees so they wouldn&#x27;t get too dark.  I was careful to rub it in and not leave any streaks or dark areas.  The color when you put it on is dark so it makes it easier to see any spots you&#x27;ve missed.&lt;br /&gt;Initially it leaves you with a bit of a golden tan.  It dried very quickly and had a pleasant coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 hours I could really see the tan.  I was concerned at first because my one ankle looked really dark...but after 6 hours I took a shower and the excess washed away and just left a nice, even, natural looking tan on my very white legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have the typical &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell after awhile so I&#x27;d apply it at night and shower it off in the morning.  The smell was no better or worse than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried...but it did seem to take a little longer to notice it as compared to other brands.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and love it.  Great price and fast service.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Love the color and for the price I would definitely buy it again. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and lingering like some other tanners I have used. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how watery it is. It runs every where. Wish it had a bit more gel texture to it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! I&#x27;m pregnant, this producted prevented me from being super pale at my baby shower.  It&#x27;s easy to use and goes on evenly. My mother was so impressed she ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned red head. I did not want to risk damaging my skin at the tanning bed, and it takes me months to build up a tan outside. Fake Bake Flawless has been the perfect answer to my tanning woes. It goes on easily, using the color guard to show you where it has been applied, and provides an instant golden tan. I&#x27;ve tried other self-tanners and was left with orange streaks. Fake Bake Flawless looks completely natural. For the first time in my life I look tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great big difference nothing to noticable tho highly recomend this</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not a regular tanner. I usually use tan wipes or go into the salon for a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this was a COMPLETE mess. I&#x27;m not sure I got a product that works or what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt has two sides - a brown side and a white side. I read the directions twice. It says to use the soft side which I assumed was the brown side. I used the product on the brown side and ended up with completely brown fingers. Both sides have no lining. I didn&#x27;t have gloves on hand and so I then tried to use a small zip-lock type baggie under the mitt. This allowed my hands not to be covered in product but I had a hard time keeping the mitt on with a baggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must not have gotten a working product. The product was complete liquid. Every time I turned over, the cap sprayed everywhere. I had to then wipe down my bathroom. By the time I had covered just my legs, 10 minutes had passed. I then proceeded to turn over the product &amp; put it on the mitt and it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was sent a product that was missing the spray. I see a spray cap in the photo but I didn&#x27;t receive one. Mine had just a regular cap like a shampoo/conditioner product. You had to turn it over and dump it on the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body took 30 minutes and was a streaky mess. I kept trying to rub it in but it would dry so quickly and the mitt kept absorbing more and more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 30 minutes it took to cover my body the bathroom was a mess. I had used about 1/2 the product or more and I was totally brown - like I had spent a month in the Cancun sun without sun block. I looked awful. I am Greek and normally have medium tone skin but this was over the top. Perhaps I used too much product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and took a shower. What a waste of time and money. I then had to clean the bathroom walls, wipe down everything and wash my bathroom rug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping I don&#x27;t wind up with brown/orange fingers since they were soaked before I  used the baggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is this a 5-star product? I read the directions three times and couldn&#x27;t figure it out.I  used the baggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is this a 5-star product? I read the directions three times and couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous....beginning to end! Great color immediately and no smell!</li>
            <li> I am very Happy with my purchase! As a busy Mom of 3boys...twins age 4 and a Sweet new little one of one month..I am not able to go to the tanning bed as I probably would have before. And fake bake has been my go to for a little bit of a tan. It spreads evenly and nicely without streaking and the color it gives is great. Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you fell into a bag of Doritos! Fake bake has definitely helped me with my confidence after giving birth also.I Love it and would definitely recommend it to friends who are not able to go to a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes you tanner but it gets into your pores and it looks like you have dirt in them but youll probably be the only one that notices that.</li>
            <li> I had an embarrassing experience with [[ASIN:B0013OJWE2 Neutrogena Micro-Mist Sunless Tanning Spray Medium - 5.3 oz]] in which I had drip marks down my calves that I didn&#x27;t realize til the next day, resulting in my legs looking like a tanned zebra, and the area where the dripped tanning product pooled--in the arches of my feet and around my heels--made my feet look like I&#x27;ve neither worn shoes nor washed my feet for the past 12 years.  VERY embarrassing...my husband had a very good laugh at my expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to conclude that fake tans need to be applied by professionals...but in reading around on Amazon, I read the great reviews here for Fake Bake, and decided since it was not a spray-on product, I&#x27;d give it one more try. I&#x27;m glad I did. The color is rich, and seems to last long. It&#x27;s not spray-on, so there are no drips and less potential mess. The bronzer really does help you to see where you are putting it on, and how much. And the thing that I&#x27;ve hated most about sunless tanners--the smell--is virtually non-existent with this product. Only sign of any sunless tanner smell is when you first wash in the shower after applying...and even then, the smell is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first application resulted in some slight streaking on the thighs, but that was more due to uneven application.  If you are sure to cover all skin area when applying (don&#x27;t be afraid to repeat over an area) you&#x27;ll have great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did follow all instructions on the bottle, as well as those provided in that first large, helpful review here on Amazon for Fake Bake.  I&#x27;m grateful for that review, as it was very detailed and helpful to me, as it obviously was to countless others.  I used the XenTan Blending Balm, and found it to be necessary for the areas where you don&#x27;t want accumulation (such as knees and ankles)--it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order the Baiden mitten recommended in that review also, but sent it back upon receiving it.  When I saw the material of the Baiden mitten, I knew that the Korean Italy cloths that I had grown up with would do the trick every bit as well, but for a fraction of the cost (you can buy them in any Korean market, or buy one on eBay for $1.15 + free shipping, versus paying $50 for the Baiden mitten). Koreans have been using these cloths for years to exfoliate.  My Korean mom used to call it \\&quot;shining\\&quot; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.  So I recommend following that first review to a tee, except replacing the Baiden mitten with a Korean Italy pocket cloth.  You can find them here on Amazon, or for even cheaper on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some exfoliating tips, and tips for using the cloth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like.  This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.  Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous, which is a pocket.  To use it, you should fold a wet but wrung out wash cloth INTO the pocket, and then roll the cloth and hold it like a baseball or rock in the palm of your hand.  Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes.  Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:  Blue is the most coarse, green is medium, pink is mild coarseness.  Occasionally you&#x27;ll find a red one, which is medium coarseness, and if you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it is.  There are a few two-sided colors as well:  Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.  If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other.  So if you buy a yellow and a plaid, you&#x27;ve got every grade of coarseness in two cloths, for about $2.30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cheapest Korean Italy cloths I&#x27;ve found were on eBay, for about just over $1, and that&#x27;s where I ordered from, as it was cheapest.  However, every one of my shipments from eBay (I ordered several different coarsenesses, from different vendors)took a couple of weeks to ship.  As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea.  If you are impatient to get them for the sake of getting started asap with your tan, consider ordering here on Amazon, where you can find quicker shipping times, including a few that qualify for Amazon Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  Overall, the Fake Bake product is AWESOME. It gave me a beautiful, deep, rich tan that so far has lasted better than a week.  I&#x27;m very pleased...RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrific product, easy to use.  End result look very natural.  Use after exfoliation in the evening.  Shower in the morning and wash any residue down the drain.  Will not transfer to clothing and lasts several days with natural tan look.  Will use often especially since I do not suntan.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, will definitely purchase again, when needed.  The perfect tan !! I recommend this product as a great self tanner. .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy to apply (definitely use a mitt), gives me a great tan, and smells OK. I recently tried using a L&#x27;Oreal tinted fake tan gel but I ended up with lots of streaks and a bit orangey. If you&#x27;re careful around your knees, ankles and elbows, this stuff gives a very natural looking tan. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange. I&#x27;m olive complexion and this gives me a nice glow on legs. My husband is very fair and this takes away from the pasty ness on his legs in the summer.</li>
            <li> Good color but it washes off right away and continues to wash off, making it good for the day you put it on.</li>
            <li> its very important to &#x27;loofah&#x27; or scrub dead skin before application.  Also make sure dry skin areas are moisturized.  Bend elbows and knees as you&#x27;re applying to those areas.  After the application, your face and body will look &#x27;dirty&#x27; and maybe even blotchy; which is totally ok.  I apply it at night before bed and rinse it off in the morning and the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> Because it makes even the lightest skin dark and doesnt smell.It is my favorite of all the tanning prouducts I have ever used!And no mess.Make sure to wash the glove.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with how you apply it, but oddly enough it works great. I followed the directions and the mitt works very well at evening things out. I exfoliated when I showered at night, and then took one more shower in the morning, scrubbed the rough spots to even things out a bit, came out looking great :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it dries insanely fast during application, which is always a plus in my book&lt;br /&gt;best part about it....IT DOESNT SMELL. I was never fond of the \\&quot;spray tan smell\\&quot;...but it smells like coconut!</li>
            <li> I love it! Product gives a natural tan, even after 1 application.&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 disadvantage: it disappears when you go swimming.</li>
            <li> I do love it! It&#x27;s a perfect colour for my skin. It\s very easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave any dirty sports on skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it was sunless, my mistake.  Haven&#x27;t used yet, and not sure I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed. I am fair with reddish undertone and I have tried so many different self tanners. All turned me orange and/or smelled disgusting. Not this one!! I was ready to give up on self tanners. In the past I&#x27;ve tried st tropez, st moritz, au courant, banana boat all gave me an orange glow. Fake bake is the most natural tanner I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve had many compliments and everyone is surprised its self tanner. It also smells like coconut, which I love.  Even after is sets it doesn&#x27;t smell. Can&#x27;t be more happy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a really great experience with Fake Bake the first time I tried it a few summers ago. I&#x27;m not pasty white, but I&#x27;m definitely fair skinned and wanted a nice glow before getting in a bikini for a summer trip. Unfortunately, I decided to try it this last May and I seemed really orange-y. I wonder if they&#x27;ve changed the formula? Or maybe the demand is just getting too high they have to sort of chip the product down a bit? I dunno, but I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it this last time. I might buy a third bottle on a whim and see if I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. fast shipping. This goes on smoothly without leaving you orange.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I bought St Tropez and everyone ranted about St Tropez well let me just tell you. Fake bake BLEW st Tropez out of the water. I was tan with fake bake and I don&#x27;t smell AT ALL with this tanning spray. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. My boss even asked me if I have been tanning after I used it! Plus not to mention the MIT that comes with it for easy application! It works wonderful I can put it on so fast! Also I noticed once I used fake bake I am so silky smooth after I used it. This is what I do with it: first shower and exfoliate then dry off and air out for a few minutes until your skin is dry then you start using fake bake with the MIT then I go to bed. After that I wake up NON SMELLY with a nice tan and I don&#x27;t shower it off until the end of the day and do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product for my wedding coming up and I&#x27;m telling you ladies this is IT!!!! Don&#x27;t buy St. Tropez like I did and waste money BUY FAKE BAKE FLAWLESS!!!</li>
            <li> Great product with great results.  Cannot live without it...and it sure beats wrinkles and rashes caused by the sun, not to mention the dangers of skin cancer - even to the young and seemingly invincible:)</li>
            <li> This product was not what I was expecting. It was easy to apply but the color payoff was so light and I&#x27;m fair skinned. I had to put on 3 layers to finally get close to the color I wanted and honestly I don&#x27;t want to do that once a week. I bought a jergens one that seemed to work a little better plus a bit cheaper. Now this product will collect dust.</li>
            <li> Still went on streaky even with glove and following directions to not spray directly to skin. Leaves a nice color though.</li>
            <li> I  really like the color this stuff leaves and I can get dressed as soon as I am done rubbing it in. I like that you can make it lighter or darker by how many times you go over it. Also if it leaks through the gloves it washes off fingers easily. I have had people comment on my nice color a few times since I started using this.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought a similar product near the same price, but am much happier with this one! This product is very cost effective, dries very quickly, and smells better than most tanning products. I also, appreciate the mitt that comes with it. The mit really helps the product to glide on without streaking, and  protects  your hands from staining!</li>
            <li> This product works like it&#x27;s supposed to. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give you super dark color right away, so you can achieve a good color that works for your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;IS NOT ORANGY. thank goodness. ;)</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  The most natural.  Remember it gets a bit darker after a little time.  Being able to see where you put it and having instant gorgeous...AHMAZING</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product. Been using Loreal Sublime. Gives a good tan, But a little orange like and streaky. This spray is perfect. The color is an amazing golden brown and the mit makes it completely streak free and smooth. Whoever gives this less than 5 stars should just stop tanning. The search has finally ended for me. Give it a shot for real. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Wow. FINALLY, a sunless tanner that actually looks (and even smells) like I just came in from &amp;#34;laying out&amp;#34;--as we used to call it! The color is exactly like my skin would normally turn after tanning! I have an olive complexion, and this stuff makes me look amazing. It&#x27;s nice to be able to see where I need to apply it as I put it on so that I don&#x27;t overlap areas I&#x27;ve already covered. And the fragrance, oh the fragrance! It smells like I had some tanning lotion on and got a tan! Seriously! This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have used so many brands of self-tanner since I stopped using tanning beds 8 years ago.  I&#x27;ve used Jergens Natural Glow (I like the face one, the body one turned my skin orange), St. Tropez Tanning Mousse (this used to be my favorite), Banana Boat, L&#x27;Oreal, the tanning towelettes (Kate Sommerville and a few other brands), etc.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them, and I haven&#x27;t been 100% happy with any of them...until now.  This Fake Bake liquid tanner is AWESOME!!!  I live in Southern California, so I like to be tan, but I don&#x27;t want the wrinkles or the cancer.  This stuff goes on very easily, and does NOT streak.  I was so excited, my husband is sick of me going on and on about this tanner, so I thought that I might as well write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous poster suggested trimming the spray bottle&#x27;s straw, and that is so important!  Cut about an inch off the bottom, then it works perfectly.  Also, I use a different pair of gloves under the tanning mitt each time, because I wear the gloves while rinsing out the mitt after applying--another important step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will LOVE this self-tanner!!!</li>
            <li> IT IS GREAT IF YOU HAVE OIL SKIN, COVERAGE IS GREAT BUT MY SKIN GOT VERY DRIED THATS WAS THE BAD THING. MAYBE I NEED A VERY MUISTURIZING BODY CREAM.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice instant color. Final color is not orange like most. Smell is pleasant. I could not use this on my face as it very drying and got streaky. Make sure to rinse the mitt after each use. Move quickly when applying as it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of sunless tanners and this is by far the best. Love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t as toxic as many other brands too. My only beef is that the mitt pills quickly, but I guess this isn&#x27;t a huge deal since one comes with every box so you get a new one each time.</li>
            <li> Works great but only feels like the tan stays for a few days instead of a &amp;#34;week&amp;#34; as the box says</li>
            <li> Smells great and darkens well. I have to get the hang of sunless tanner application, but it works!</li>
            <li> Last Friday afternoon:  Exfoliated skin using coconut oil and granulated sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Showered and shaved.  Followed the YouTube Tutorial Videos instead of the written instruction to spray on skin instead of mitt.  REALLY good advice because the mitt absorbs too much for legs, for example.  I will use spray-to-mitt technique on my chest and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;It just could be my body chemistry, but the very first application smelled great.  After about two hours, however,  that nasty tanning solution smell came and I got REALLY discouraged...not again.  Not this product... But, low and behold, it just needed that first application period, I guess, to get settled in.  Because the next day and on into this week, the smell is totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;As far as when to start your first application:  Again, this is just my observation -  it might be better if you&#x27;re doing stuff around the house to apply it then (let yourself &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; so to speak).  If you are prone to sweat at night, it might not be advisable to apply before bed, as the box directions suggest.  I wouldn&#x27;t dare.&lt;br /&gt;So, initial application was immediate results but because I&#x27;ve been super-pasty white all winter, I didn&#x27;t have the guts to wear shorts the next day - to a picnic.  However, by Sunday I did!  Now it&#x27;s Tuesday and I&#x27;ve only done a little touch-up on a few areas and I feel really confident!!!  The stuff doesn&#x27;t come off on my white towels and even after workouts/showers/shaving, I&#x27;ve only had to do that one slight touch-up.  So, yes, this is confidence in a bottle and I am officially and forever hooked to this product!!</li>
            <li> I found this worked well but could not stand the smell.  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy again but I know alot of people like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago and just got around to using it. It was so easy to apply with the included glove, smells great (coconut-y) and I look like I&#x27;ve spent about a week in the sun without any of the sun damage. Definitely exfoliate WELL before hand because I can tell I didn&#x27;t do my knees well and they look a little muddy (absorbed too much product) -user error on my part. I am VERY satisfied with this product so far!!</li>
            <li> I like the color.  However, I guess I am not sure which side you spray on the mitt.  I sprayed on the whited side and used that side and it leaked totally through the mitt.  Are you suppose to use the Velour side?  Good question, that instruction was not include on how to use the mitt.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Came quick and exactly what I wanted! Used the gloves so less product was left on the mitt and wasted!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried self tanners and been to get a professional spray tan done in salons but never found any that I truly loved until purchasing Fake Bake Flawless. I have light skin and therefore am a little nervous about putting something on that screams self tan. That is not the case with this product. It goes on easily, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t have the bad odor associated with most self tans. I put this on at night before bed so it could process during sleeping hours as it does get a little of that smell after a few hours of wearing it but if you are asleep, who cares!? I woke up and showered leaving a completely natural looking tan. I only applied once and it has just gradually faded throughout the week. It has not streaked at all and has faded very naturally. I wasn&#x27;t going to be wearing a bikini or anything so I only applied it to all places that would be exposed with a strapless one piece. In the buff, it looked just like I had been out on the beach in a once piece bathing suit and you can see a huge difference with just one application as my stomach was snow white and where I had applied the tanner was the most amazing, natural bronze tan. I will be using the product again this Friday and probably once a week throughout summer and into fall as it makes me feel much more comfortable in sleeveless tanks or shorts. I highly recommend Fake Bake Flawless. I got a bowl of sugar and took it to the shower prior to applying, mixing it with my soap and a wash cloth to exfoliate as you don&#x27;t want anything that contains oils to exfoliate because it will block the tanner from absorbing. I put a tad of lotion on my elbows, knees and ankles/feet right before applying and I am completely happy. Not to mention, the price is FANTASTIC. The only thing I&#x27;d like is the option to purchase a few mitts at a time because it will wear out fast. Hint: to keep mitt from slipping around while applying just take a rubber band and put it on your wrist over the mitt and it will stay put while applying. ;)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after reading positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice that I didn&#x27;t have to shower twice in an hour like with 60 min fake bake. Def gives color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But- this left an orange color esp on my wrists &amp; hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think 60 min gives a more realistic tan color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this one more try before I order the other one again:).</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product. i spent counless of hours reaearching it and I thought the spray and mitt was a cool concept being that besides jergens glow this was the first sunless tanner I ever tried. Everyone said it has a tropical scent and that sold me being that jergens smelled horribly when the color was being actviated. So I went and got this. The product came and i was sooo excited to use it and I shaved and exfoliated as always told prior to sunless tanninng.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I ever used it I did not mousturize my body because I thought the lotion would be a barrier and not allow the product to properly penetrate. When i rubbed my skin it felt dry so i did not like that but i saw immediate color and loved the smell so I thought yes, first tanner and i found the one? The next morning I showered and I saw the barrier wash off as was supposed to. But then I come off the shower and no color is left over. Second attempt that night this time i applied lotion. Waited till that dried and sprayed the fake bake rubbed in and cont to spray alot more than I would have liked in hopes for some color. Next morning shower the color washes off again and leaves me with no tann whats so ever. I still had hopes and thought maybe Im doing something wrong. It took sooooo many application and actual spritz of the product to get some color that I just stopped usinf it all togother. The product did not give a dark or med tan even and if so it wasted soo much product. For reference i am NC40-42 in mac which is not a dark skintone to beging with. I have a light to med olive  complexion and when I tan in the beach i do not burn i get DARK. I Wasnt trying to be as dark as the real sun gets me but a slight tint being that even though i have an olive complexion the winter getd me reallly pale. I recommend yall try sun labs sunless tanner!! It worker soooo well with only one application! The color pay off was great and it does not have a sunless tanner smell</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on clean, smells great, absorbs well, and looks natural. Ill never use another self tanner again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely zero complaints regarding this Fake Bake Flawless product it is just absolutely fantastic! It looks so good.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tan made easy!  Wish it did&#x27;t fade, but very easy to re-apply.  So thankful I will never have to visit tanning salons ever again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. really good price also. Easy to use, looks very real. Dries fast, last a couple days.then apply more.</li>
            <li> My love for fake bake products started with the original lotion. It by far had the best color I had ever used, but was somewhat difficult and time consuming to get right. After pouring over the reviews for Flawless, I decided to give it a shot. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin! The name says it all! This product is Flawless! It is the easiest, fastest sunless tanner I have used. I took the advice of the other reviewers and snipped the sprayer about an inch, so there was no leaking issues. It smells phenomenal and dries almost instantly! I had beautiful, even, color all over my body within ten minutes. Before, I had to pick and choose which extremities I would try to tan because of the time consuming issue of drying and applying evenly. The mitt that comes with this and the fast drying formula makes it possible to have an all over body tan in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY small complaint I have is the lotion seems to last longer, but I found that if I just reapply a little in the morning and keep myself moisturized, it extends the life of the tan.&lt;br /&gt;You will save yourself a ton of time and money if you buy this product! Take it from the girl who has tested almost every brand on the market between sprays/lotions/wipes....you name it, I tried them. Flawless gets my vote for the best!</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, and the initial smell isn&#x27;t bad. The following day I noticed that familiar self Tanner smell. The glove gave me no problem with shedding and I washed it every so many uses. I will say this faded very quickly for me, and I had to reapply every other day. It&#x27;s also not beach or water friendly, and tended to run and spot, which led to daily applications at one point. Perhaps that&#x27;s not the case if you are avoiding salt water, but it didn&#x27;t hold up well, in my experience. It&#x27;s one if the better self tanners out there in terms of ease and color. But lacking in durability, fading substantially with each wash. If I were simply just hanging out on the beach, it&#x27;s fantastic for giving that tan without the sun damage. With as much as you&#x27;ll spend on other tanners, give it a try.</li>
            <li> One of the best colors I&#x27;ve ever seen with a self-tanner. No offensive smell, not greasy spray formula. That would make it top notch, except that it takes longer to buff on (with the provided mitt) than most tanners, and more than half of the color washes off with the first shower. Even after layering every other day for a week, I found that that schedule had to be maintained to retain the color. For the price, I feel it should be more low-maintenance. It just isn&#x27;t worth it in my book.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail yesterday and applied right away...the tan looks so natural and dries really fast:). Will definitely continue using this product and will tell others about it!</li>
            <li> I have always used Fake Bake Flawless because of its simple application and really good color.  I love the smell too, kind-of beachy.  I have to re-apply every other day, but it dries in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake the best self tanner hands down !  No orangey strange color. Goes on smooth and you can see immediately where the color is. Smells nice and dries very quickly. I bought this because N.E. winters are long and relatively sunless. I had a dinner to attend and was wearing a dress. My legs were so pale my blue veins were on display. Only one application and my legs looked great. Not over tanned, just perfect for early spring. Since then I have used Fake Bake about every 3 days and my legs are beautiful. If you&#x27;re thinking about using a self tanner this is it ! Don&#x27;t risk skin cancer when you can have a beautiful, natural looking Fake Bake tan. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m a teenager with fair skin. I have used many different self-tanners before in my life, and from the reviews, I was expecting a lot more when I used Fake Bake. The self-tanner fills in your pores, making them a dark brown color, and it looks completely unnatural. I used a mitt and the application was still uneven. I used it more than a few times to try to give it a second chance, and I even had my sister, who is a cosmetologist, and my mother, who is a licensed esthetician, apply the self tanner for me. It was always splotchy in the sunlight, and filled in my pores. The color is okay, I guess, but it&#x27;s obvious that it isn&#x27;t natural. I&#x27;d advise people NOT to buy this. You can get the St. Tropez self-tanning pump bottle for a little bit more, and it will give you way better, more easily obtainable results.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every self tanner out there and this is by far, my favorite. Use to use St. Tropez but this one tops it and the price is better!! Not a huge fan of the mit that is included though.</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect for any skin color. Goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t show lines. Easy to apply! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked well and smells great!</li>
            <li> I faked everyone with this product that I had tanned naturally over a weekend! No orange, no streaks, easy to apply. I am now devoted to this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Gives me a perfect, flawless, natural looking tan without the harmfulness of a tanning bed. Smells wonderful and very easy to apply. Drys quickly and never looks streaky. It&#x27;s a must have!!</li>
            <li> Gives a good natural color only problem is it&#x27;s very sensitive to water and if you try to build your tan it can look weird everything else: smell , look , and applicator is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- word of caution, make sure you wear gloves under your mitt or you&#x27;ll end up with orange hands :/</li>
            <li> Received fake bake and love the product!! Only thing is one arrived opened and made a mess. I&#x27;m unsure of how to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> it definitely delivers a nice brown tan but it washes off pretty quickly. Smells the best out of all self tanners I tried</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this. I&#x27;ve used lotions before but never a spray. Almost instantly gave me some nice color. It didn&#x27;t look orange at all. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have used.  Goes on easy with the spray and mit.  Even color no streaking!</li>
            <li> I would say for the price, this tanner is very good. It&#x27;s no St. Tropez but fairly close. There are a few drawbacks though. The sprayer tends to get clogged so the tanner will leak out when you&#x27;re spraying and get all over the bottle. I have tried trimming the tube and it helps a little but doesn&#x27;t stop the problem all together. Secondly, if you don&#x27;t maintain the tan, it sloughs off unevenly. I went on a week long cruise and didn&#x27;t take my bottle. I exfoliate every night so I know it wasn&#x27;t because of that but towards the end of the week my legs were starting to look speckled. I could see where the tanner had come off and where it still was. Once I got home I applied another coat and it went away. So be aware of that if you&#x27;re taking a long trip.</li>
            <li> Tried tons of tanning products. This one is easy to use, little smell, dries super fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. It&#x27;s really easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird discoloration and looks fantastic. The gloves and mitts that come with it are perfect. I looked sun-kissed in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanner and it works great,easy application and it&#x27;s rare that I have any major streaking BUT for all the reviews who say it doesn&#x27;t smell...it does..I could sniff you out of a crowd if you had this on, just my opinion, I hate how it smells. But great tanner.</li>
            <li> my fav sunless tanner thus far</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake products and this may be the best one yet.  You don&#x27;t have to constantly rub it in repeatedly, just a few times will do (like you were rubbing in lotion) and no streaks!  Does a great job of giving you a nice tan!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all...trust me.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars searching for that all around great self-tanner.  I found it!! I always exfoliate and am super careful about putting on a pre-balm that helps to fight the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; around the ankles, hands, and elbows..I am super satisfied with Fake Bake Flawless...</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE THIS STUFF. you get such a great look after just one use and everyone at work the next day thought it was a real tan. They couldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t real. If you&#x27;re pretty pail like me you might have to use it a few days in a row. i think i used it 3 days in a row and then maintain it with a cheap gradual lotion tanner once a day from Ulta. I use the fake bake flawless about once a week once you get the color you want.</li>
            <li> This is THE best stuff ever invented! Goes on SO smooth &amp; so much easier than any kind of lotion! &amp; of course I love the fact that I can protect my health a little bit from using this product &amp; staying away from tanning beds. Love me some Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> 5 stars because you can achieve a flawless application, the smell is the best of all the self tanners I&#x27;ve tried, and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> It clogs your pores to where it looks like you&#x27;ve broken out in black heads everywhere.I don&#x27;t like the smell and think its very messy to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times and I love the product. Why the 3 stars then? Well I ordered this like normal and the first thing I noticed was 2 things were missing. The spray cap and the gloves. I have a wedding in a few days and I have no time to return it to get what the right thing. (You don&#x27;t even want to know what other method I had to use..) normally I&#x27;m very satisfied  with this product but not today.</li>
            <li> It has a very tropical scent, however eventually (an hour or two later), the stinky self-tanning scent emerges.  At least it&#x27;s better than the spray tans that make your whole bathroom/hallway stink for a day.  It does not stink up the house.  I really like the color this gives, but I will not repurchase, since I had to religiously apply, since it does not seem to last.  Then, once you acheive your desired color, it only seems to last 2 days or so on me.  The neutrogena spray lasts 5-6 days on me.  I don&#x27;t have time to add this into my daily/every other day routine, so out the door for me.  Might work for some others who have more time or maybe it will last longer for you!</li>
            <li> Most amazing self tanner I have ever tried. I love it. I usually spend $30 to get a spray tan but no more. I just used this for the first time and I&#x27;m tan. I have more then enough left to use several times. No sticky feeling and dries instantly with no yucky scent. My skin is dry and tan. Loving this product. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ive been so scared to try any tanning products and when I finally took the risk ive been addicted ever since.  This product is so easy to apply. A monkey can do it but its not easy to apply on the face.  I find it gets blotchy on the face but its a quick fix if u put some garnier bb cream in medium dark on when doing ur makeup. I ordered the fake bake for face-&lt;br /&gt; That should solve my blotchyness issue.  Worth a try and worth every penny.  If you love being tanned this is the product you need. Be patient though. If you are looking to be ultra dark brown you need to apply it everyy night until you reach the desired color and then maintain it once a week.  Dont leave the house without rinsing off the color guide!!!  Once you rinse in the shower for about 5 minutes, your tan evens out and looks perfect.  Bottom line: You have to try this!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff gives great color and looks fantastic but beware once you stop using it. It fades horribly blotchy and made my pale self look like I had some kind of skin disease for a few weeks before it was all gone. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning spray! It is by far the best self tanner I have purchased. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence!  I am super pale, work night shift and needed something to make me look not so washed out.  This stuff is great!  I would shower before bed, apply and let it dry (it dries within minutes and smells nice!!) then jump in bed.  Get up in the morning, rinse it off in the shower and apply lotion and you&#x27;re good to go!  I apply ever 4 days or so with great results.  If I want a little more color I apply a second coat to my legs after the am shower and wear the application all day at work then shower off when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE:  Yes, there will be some degree of overspray!!! I personally just jump in the tub and apply there - then rinse the walls when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> My third bottle of this (1per summer) and I tell everyone to get it. Love it! The smell isn&#x27;t bad, makes my skin feel so soft and no streaks!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I have ever purchased!! I exfoliate and shave before applying and the color looks good I can put on and actually go out in public without looking crazy!!</li>
            <li> This works better than any other spray on tanning formula i have ever used....natural looking tan no orange looking skin. the product goes on with ease it should be called REAL BAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake because the color is perfect for me, I put one coat on at night then when I take a shower the next day I put another coat on and that&#x27;s it for about four days when it starts to fade, I usually do another coat for a few more day then I exfoliate and start over. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is a spray and I want it to be a mousse, even though I do not spray this directly on my skin, I put it on the mitt, it is still messy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does the work it is suppose to do. My only issue is that it washes away in the shower.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sunless tanning. Hold bottle away from skin and don&#x27;t put on too heavily. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product is not an insta-tan but is the best working tanner I&#x27;ve tried (out of 3). If you are fair and pasty like me :), it will take awhile before you see TAN but you will eventually see some TAN. One reason why this product does not get 5 stars is because the tanned effect does not last long before you need to reapply (5-6 days) to avoid the blotch. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This color of fake tanning is great, never orange always nice brown tanned color. Easy to apply and dries soooo fast. Minimal transfer.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanning bed addict since I was young (about 14, and I&#x27;m now 21) but I recently was diagnosed with skin cancer and had to stop tanning in the UV light. I started looking for self tanners because I just can&#x27;t handle being pale! It looks good on some, but not on me! I tried Million Dollar Tan because it was so hyped up on YouTube and I hated it and I also tried SunLabs because I also heard some good things but it wasn&#x27;t my favorite. Next I tried Fake Bake Flawless and I love it. I get the best brown tan like I used to get when I tanned in the tanning bed but without the damage to my skin and fear of cancer recurrence. I do recommend moisturizing your skin with your daily lotion BEFORE applying Fake Bake Flawless, but that generally goes for any self tanning product. If you moisturize beforehand, the product just goes on so much more nicely and stops it from clinging to any areas. I would definitely repurchase this product, I&#x27;ve actually already got some more on the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Only takes me about 10 minutes to apply with the mitt. Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;2. The color guard is not overwhelming, looks natural. You can tan and then go about your day. (although I like to tan before I go to bed).&lt;br /&gt;3. The color begins developing after about 10 minutes on me and gets darker for the next few hours. I&#x27;m not sure how long you are supposed to wait to show because the packaging does not say but I usually wait several hours just in case.&lt;br /&gt;4. The color lasts longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve seen several reviews saying the color doesn&#x27;t last very long but it does for me. I also moisturize my skin very well though.&lt;br /&gt;5. Fades sooooo nicely!! This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that does not cling to my dry areas (knees, elbows, ankles, and hands). I can actually put this on my hands without it looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t think of any!</li>
            <li> Very good product it did everything nicely  didn&#x27;t have orange tint  three girls at work tried it we were all pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> streaks when i sweat at the gym (or wherever), but i sweat a lot. it&#x27;s nice as a bronzer on the face if you&#x27;re going out or something! nice color. only thing I&#x27;m cautious about are all the chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product through smlx0 on YouTube and I decided to try it since she provided such a good review. This is seriously THE best self tanner I have ever used. I&#x27;m super pale and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting my self tanner to not be streaky or orange or blotchy, and I found that this self tanner fixed all of those problems. Not only is it super easy to apply, but the color lasts forever, it doesn&#x27;t wash off streaky like other tanners, it smells AMAZING even after it&#x27;s dry, and speaking of drying, I can get dressed immediately after putting this on without having to worry about it coming off on my clothes. Seriously, this stuff is incredible and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants a natural looking fake bake. I just ordered the darker tanner from this brand and I&#x27;m super excited to see how it turns out. Must-have for all you tan junkies who want the tan without the damaging effects of a tanning bed!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this spray 3 times and will continue to purchase it in the future! I have bought every self tanner on the market and despite all of them claiming to be the most natural looking tan around, always end up making me look like a walking Dorito. This product is every bit as good as anything used in a professional tanning salon! You can see the tan immediately and after a couple of applications, you will look as though you have been tanning naturally for months. I have had people compliment my tan and ask me which tanning salon I go to. They cannot believe that I got this look from a bottle. I have never been so in love with a purchase in all of my life!! Fan for life!!!!</li>
            <li> Best tanning I have used! And I have tried a lot of them! Last about 4-5 days and it looks so natural! I used this before my wedding.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in a box that looked like it went to war.  Needless to say the product was slightly torn and leaked</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again. I love the color-my husband still thinks it was a real tan...he has no idea. I like the application process and the mitt you use for it. I do suggest rinsing it here and there or the color does start to get messed up. the big downfall for me is that even after a couple of days it still wipes off on your clothes and towels. I like to wear white tank tops and two days later it will still transfer to the inside. And that&#x27;s while just sitting around....no sweating! I also had to put away my white bath towels to protect them. The good news though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain... everything has washed up fine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! For 2 years I was using Fake Bake original, I had no complaints with that other than sometimes I would feel a little orange but I never do with this product.  I don&#x27;t use the spray attachment because I don&#x27;t think enough comes out at once to cover certain areas.  The mitt it comes with is also great because it really smooths the liquid over your skin evenly.  I will definitely be using this product again</li>
            <li> It definitely works!!  However, it&#x27;s a pain to apply. Plan on spending at least a half hour.  It makes a huge mess too.  I wound up doing it while standing in the shower just to save all of my bath mats. And it smells sooooo bad. I like smelling nice and feminine. This stuff makes your skin stink like... Fake tanner, lol. I really wanted to like it more, and again it does work, but the cons make it hard to want to use it consistently so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;love&lt;br /&gt;dark but natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m a medium skinned gal who tans easily but for some mysterious reason my legs take forever to darken.&lt;br /&gt;this product had rave reviews and 2 days later i was smearing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. don&#x27;t use the mitten.  it&#x27;s useless. it pills and breaks down verily easily.&lt;br /&gt;b.  always use gloves.&lt;br /&gt;c.  it looks DARK but is fabulous!  no orange streaks.&lt;br /&gt;d. smells yummy.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on Amazon about this product, I gave it a try. I have since returned for another bottle. This self-tanner gives a natural-looking tan, with no orange tinge.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake was as advertised....easy to apply, didn&#x27;t turn orange and didn&#x27;t streak.  If you want to have that tan look without laying out in the hot sun this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and easy to apply. Not super stinky like some. Most self tanners look good on me and don&#x27;t turn orange. I would think if you are extremely pale this wouldn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have tried multiple lotion and aerosol based tanning products. None work as well as this one. I have very fair skin and the tone change is not unbelievable in being too dark nor does this turn your organge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is so easy. Just spray it on and LIGHTLY spread the spray with the application pad. If you push too hard you will just wipe it off.  Definitely exfoliate prior to use and give yourself about 30 mins to dry completely. The application pad is easy to use. Just rinse it out immediately after use. I can do my arms and legs in about 5 minutes. I would stand in a bath tub or shower to spray your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the color lasts about four days before fading. But I apply a small amount at a time. I have tried applying generously. But the darker color dosent look natural on me.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  After about the second or third application, I started to see results.  Then I skipped a day, and applied the next two consecutive days, and suddenly I was nicely dark!  I&#x27;m pretty pale naturally--really got this more to hide the veins on my legs than to get a tan, but the color has made my legs look so much nicer.  It&#x27;s easy and quick to apply, dries quickly (smells like coconut), and gives very natural looking results.  I&#x27;m not afraid to wear shorts anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my face.  Most reviewers of the face formula say that this regular body formula works much better on the face, so I&#x27;m going to stick with this one and eventually muster up the courage to try it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note.  For some reason, the uptake on the back of my hands is greater than elsewhere, maybe because my skin is drier there.  The instructions do say to brush lightly over the hands and feet, and that&#x27;s probably good advice.  One or two applications there, and my hands were as dark as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product for people with SLE who can&#x27;t tan in the sun at all, and for anyone else who takes seriously the damage that the sun can do to their skin.</li>
            <li> love this!  I have been using it with the applicator mitt that comes with the lotion type.  It is very easy to apply &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Best fake tan I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it smells great and goes on looking very natural. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like some other products. Excellent!</li>
            <li> For a quick easy color, this stuff is great. I&#x27;m impressed how evenly it applies. I&#x27;ve had many spray tans, and this stuff is just as good! Love the smell too. Also, it&#x27;s not sticky like many other formulas. So excited I can do quick touch ups and color my legs when I need to! Might become obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have very fair, Irish skin, the kind that burns and never, never gets tan. This product gives me a natural tan that does not look orange. Miracle product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she is happy about it. What more can I ask? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend. Try it you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different tanning products on Amazon, based on good reviews, and this one is so good. Way better than the other. No streaks, no orange, smell is decent and it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply. I like the mitt also. I took another reviewers advice and wash the mitt out after every use; so far so good. I am happy with the color and am in the process of buying another bottle, as well as the FB lotion to try it out.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it for a week before a vacation. I did follow the instructions.  You will look tanner right after applying because there&#x27;s a bronzer in it but it washes off when you shower.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product is AMAZING! I live in Seattle and we don&#x27;t get enough sun to get a great tan. However I have been complimented on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; everyday for the past week. It looks so natural! I love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and even! Great color!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product !!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Perfect tan, and lessening my risk of skin cancer, it&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
            <li> I got this product within the same week of ordering, and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;m not left with any streaks whatsoever. Everyone talking about it leaking.. That never happened to me. The only thing that I could somewhat complain about, is when applying with the mitt that is included, it can sometimes seep onto my fingers. But the color is great! Boosts you into shades darker! I&#x27;ve used Million Dollar Tanning products, and I&#x27;ve got to say that this by far beats it! This color is not orange at all, but more so GOLDEN BROWN. It&#x27;s great! I encourage anyone to give it a try. This was also my first time using a spray method for tanning.. Easy for anyone!</li>
            <li> I received this tanner three days ago. I was so excited.  I watched countless youtube videos along with rave reviews.  I used tips consumers posted as well as following the instructions.  It looked amazing at first. I applied it before bed and showered in the morning. I had no color left...and the insides of my elbow creases were huge white oblong parts where the tanner had completely wiped off. I was sad. I wish I knew what caused that. Will try again.</li>
            <li> I feel so great with this tan. it is a nice bronze, and so easy to apply and dries very quickly too. Lasts through a shower, but is easy to scrub off if needed.</li>
            <li> Tans quickly and looks natural. Lasts a few days with one application.</li>
            <li> I have never used a self tanner b 4 but I really like this all my friends asked me where I been tanning the results show up immediately I love this stuff I will buy this again I might buy the darker one though.</li>
            <li> Seriously the Best fake tan!!!</li>
            <li> Best at home tanner I have ever tried</li>
            <li> So dark!! In all fairness I am extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I used this and although the color came out nice at first...it started to break out horribly within 2 uses.  The application is also a messy situation...the glove leaves streaks unless you rub and rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I realized that it was the mitt causing my skin to break out...so I stopped using the mitt and just started using my hand or gloves and mixed this product with Sun Lab tanning, and the results are amazing!!</li>
            <li> this is the first tanning product i have used that works without streaks. i love the mitt and gloves. i am very pale and this gave a nice natural looking tan. it also lasted all summer.  i would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love Fake bake! Constantly repurchase because I&#x27;m always so satisfied. And the bottle lasts me a while. Smells great, tropical kind of like coconut. I put it on before I sleep (spray two pumps onto glove for each limb, four each for torso/back, and one for my face). I wake up bronzed and after I shower, the base color is gone and I am left with a beautiful tan. I usually do this about 3x a week to be as tan as I want to be for an event. It&#x27;s nice because it is buildable: want a glow? Do once. Want to be &amp;#34;just got back from vacation in the Caribbean&amp;#34; tan? Do each night for a week. And at this price - you can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Fake Bake Flawless! I&#x27;m very pale and only burn in the sun. I tried St. Tropez mousse previous to this and didn&#x27;t care much for the results (it only worked on my arms). Fake Bake worked great, had a nice smell to it, easy to apply, lasts fairly long (3-4 days unless you apply every other night) and this doesn&#x27;t stain everything. I also really love that this is also a build able tan, so the more you apply, the darker you get! Only problem is that it didn&#x27;t really work on my stomach or lower back? So, I will try a couple more brands for that area specifically. But, I am still a fan of this stuff and will more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li> My first experience with a self tanner was a St. Tropez gradual tanning lotion that I didn&#x27;t really care for. But I like the way I look with a tan, so I got online and did some research. Flawless got great reviews across the board and I even found a video of a girl showing how easy it was to use it (a real person, not someone who worked for FB).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to Boots and grabbed a bottle. I love this this stuff. It&#x27;s SO easy to do, dries in a flash and smells nice (like sun tan lotion). Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the dark color when you first spray it on, you WON&#x27;T be that dark at all as it gets lighter as you rub it in. I would do mine in the afternoon or evening and take a shower the next morning (the longer you wait to wash it off, the better..at least 6-8 hrs). You will get a fair amount of color washing off, but you will still be tan. I used it for 3-4 days, until I got to the color I wanted, and then once or twice a week after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently done w/my tanning for the year and have allowed this to wash off completely and there&#x27;s no issues with looking stripy or patchy as it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for anyone, but especially for those new to self tanning, as I was. They give you everything you need in the box (gloves and mitt). The color guide in the product makes it beyond simple to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere. The best way to apply it, and to save on how much product you use, is to spray it directly onto the skin and blend it in with the mitt....otherwise the mitt tends to absorb it and you have to use more. One bottle lasted me about a month and a half, applying regularly as I said above.</li>
            <li> I liked this spray but it was different then what expected I used the st topez along with it so I got really go results but I feel this product by itself would not have been excellent</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Not messy, easy to apply and gives great color! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This kit is great - it&#x27;s very easy. I highly recommend exfoliating first and applying small layers daily instead of too much at one time. Tan is a nice brown and not orangy. Mitt makes application easy. I can apply and immediately get dressed - doesn&#x27;t wear stain your clothes and doesn&#x27;t leave obvious streaking.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I get compliments daily as this product looks bronzed and natural. It doesn&#x27;t streak and I&#x27;ve recommended it to many people.</li>
            <li> I am olive complexion.  Most of my body tans very well but for some reason my legs don&#x27;t get dark.  I don&#x27;t like to spend to much time in the sun so I decided to try this.  I exfoliated my legs first then applied with the applicatior glove.  Looked amazingly natural.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It lasts, it does not streak and it looks natural. Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love! Much more involved than the lore all tan wipes I&#x27;m used to using but def worth the time! Perfect tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond pale. I don&#x27;t tan in the sun or in tanning beds so I always go for this. It goes on great and does not leave you streaky! I get a little help with my back but if I can&#x27;t it never looks like there is a line, it blends very well! I wish it was still on the subscribe and save list though :(</li>
            <li> I would like to say though that I just don&#x27;t think self tanning is for me. I&#x27;ve not used any others so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything. Here is what I did not like.  The smell.  OMG I don&#x27;t know what that smell is but it didn&#x27;t go away.  I have a small seborrheic keratoses spot on the side of my leg near my knee that completely blends in with my skin and goes unnoticed during the winter months but if my legs get sun in the summer it turns white and sticks out...with this stuff it turns a super dark brown. LOL I should just get natural sun and put this stuff on it with a Qtip LOL. Seriously though, even though I exfoliated and did what the directions said around the knees and elbows, they still got too dark.  The mitt kept coming off my hand.  I might just be really bad at applying self tanner though but the smell ... I just can&#x27;t get over that. I could still smell it after my shower and perfume :(</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical about sunless tanners, but when my sister in law told me about this and I saw the results on her, I had to try it. I went to Amazon, read the reviews, and with 95% or more being good reviews I decided to order. There were a few bad reviews, but you just have to learn how to apply it and you MUST follow the directions. Make sure to exfoliate as directed. This is only required before the first use. The first application blew my mind. I am VERY fair skinned. I have blond hair and blue eyes and I burn very easily in the sun so I am at a higher risk for skin cancer than some and tanning beds are just not for me. After the first application, I had a TAN! Make sure to put on at night and wash off in morning. (I tried just putting it on and going, but it does spot if you get water on it. If you apply at night and wash off in the morning, it does not spot. It also does not wash your color off. You will still have a tan.) It took about 3 applications for me to successfully have covered without leaving lighter spots. I have been using it for  weeks now and I love it. Only have to apply it 2-3 times a week to keep my color.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO DOESN&#x27;T OR CAN&#x27;T TAN! This product is what it claims to be!!</li>
            <li> Amazing &amp; very good price!</li>
            <li> Love it best tan product I have ever used. Love that you can see it going on and can have color that day!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t look orange, but you need to make sure your skin is clean and you&#x27;re freshly shaven or it will look funny and not adhere to your skin properly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I am hooked after two uses. It leaves such a natural looking tan and the mitt makes it a breeze to apply flawlessly. The color lasts for a couple days but that is fine with me. I did what one of the other reviewers mentioned by snipping the straw down a bit to prevent leaking. Great suggestion! Also I have been washing the mitt after each use which seems to help. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Performed exactly as promised.  I will definitely purchase this product again.  Tan is very natural.  No orange color.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like this self tanner but it isn&#x27;t perfect. It seems to rinse off when you shower or bathe so to actually keep a nice glow you have to do it often, if not daily. It also gets into pores on my chest and stains them making them more visible as well as getting into my hair follicles on my legs.  I have little dark dots all over my legs from the tanner getting in my follicles on days I use the tanner.&lt;br /&gt;That said it is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, is pretty easy to keep from looking streaky, and isn&#x27;t too orange looking.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better and I like the tan but don&#x27;t want to be out in the sun because cancer runs in my family.  I also have recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> id recommend coppertone sunless tanner instead.&lt;br /&gt;pros-smells good&lt;br /&gt;-quick changes&lt;br /&gt;-even/fast application except for face&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;-prone to make face look awkwardly brown. mitt tough to apply on facial features&lt;br /&gt;edit:can be manageable, just needs less juice at once and faster, even rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;-fades quickly with water, almost all with facial cleanser&lt;br /&gt;-more brown than tan, burnt look.</li>
            <li> I am naturally extremely pale, and have tried every self-tanner I can get my hands on. Nothing even compares to this one. Once you get a little practice, you can give yourself a tan that looks natural and has no streaks. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and natural looking DIY spray tan. Perfect for touch ups. Smells amazing unlike others that I have tried</li>
            <li> I have bought the fake bake spray three times now this last time was from a different seller but I read some of the reviews that talked about the spray area leaking really bad &amp; the first two times I bought it I didn&#x27;t have a problem but this bottle I just purchased will be my last! It leaks so bad I had to buy a spray cap to replace the one that came with it. The color washes off when you shower so you have to keep re applying every night/day which I hate. It uses up a lot of product. I am switching to the lotion maybe that will work better for me!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice since April. Easy to use! It&#x27;s a nice tan color not orange. LOVE, LOVE, Love it!!</li>
            <li> Every bit of, except under my arms, came off on my bed sheets over a few days. After a week all of it was on my sheets and bath towels. Back to the real tan for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sunless tanning queen! I tried this after seeing several good reviews and thought I would give it a shot. Absolutely love it! I recommend this to anyone. It was very easy to apply and had tropical scent to it. I didn&#x27;t smell like that nasty sunless tan smell afterwards. It did everything it said it would on the box! Streak free, easy application, and a beautiful color. Not to mention the fact that it come with a pump sprayer. The pump makes for an easier application. It&#x27;s the easiest and most mess free product I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ll for sure be sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> Hey it goes on making you look tan. then when you shower after 6-9 hours most of it does come off.But it does leave a lil color on you.cant complain!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the mitt and the application; but after the first time I used this and saw how easy it was to apply, I was hopeful.  Then I saw the color.  After just one application, a friend asked me how I got so tan!  And definitely not orange or muddy looking, but a beautiful slightly darker than your natural shade tan!  Hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to the pricey salons for a spray tan, and always came back orange.  This applies easily, and I look like I got an actualy tan!&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is the bottle - it does leak like other people have mentioned.  And if you have any sort of age spots/scars/freckles, it will MAGNIFY them (but that is true of any fake tanner I believe).</li>
            <li> It creates a beautiful, realistic warm, brown looking tan, is easy to apply, and what little of the color that rubbed off on my linen sheets washed out. One bottle was enough for at least six full body applications. Downsides: the tube of the spray bottle was too long (what??? why?) and I had to cut it; it only lasts about three days;. and I found that I have to wait a couple weeks to reapply, since doing two sessions back to back creates a spotty, streaky effect, whether I&#x27;ve exfoliated or not. That&#x27;s a shame, since I don&#x27;t have much need to look tan for only three days every two weeks and going from fair to tan to fair rapidly looks weird.</li>
            <li> Delivers a nice golden brown color immediately.  Dries in seconds but the tropical scent lingers.  Working with the mitt, it&#x27;s almost goof-proof.  And one bottle lasts a long time.  A Fake Bake winner!</li>
            <li> I believe the formula changed recently. Purchased a bottle a month ago and the bottle color changed. No big deal..but when I applied as usual there is a very pink undertone..so much so that I thought the new pink colored mitt was bleeding dye..nope, its the spray..turns red when I wash it off the tub. It also is VERY blotchy..didn&#x27;t have this problem before..I found a much better product with longer lasting results, less smell and cheaper at the local Sally Beauty so this is just sitting unused..bummer..seemed pretty good before.</li>
            <li> Looks natural on. Easy to apply !</li>
            <li> First fake tan to provide me a mit and I love it.  Rubs on well and I&#x27;ve been impressed with the results.  I would recommend spraying the tan onto the mit in a sink or some small area that will catch the mist that misses the glove.  Thought I was containing it until I cleaned my bathroom floor... Brown everywhere!</li>
            <li> I have used it for several weeks now. I usually put on two nights in a row to get the color that I want and then it lasts for a week. It&#x27;s not orange, it&#x27;s not streaky, and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell. I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural! Will continue to use this product! Only negative thing is, It washes off, without leaving a existing tan,</li>
            <li> Color goes on super smooth, no streaks, no fake color.  Even on my hands and tops of feet, no crazy lines or too much color deposited.  Of course, you do have to be diligent about prep - exfoliating, applying barrier to knees, ankles, elbows etc.  But if you are, your results should be fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake the original lotion for years and LOVE it. I wanted something to use in between my weekly tanning nights and thought this would be great. It is AMAZING! I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not very dark if you use it alone but mid week with the lotion is a great combination. It dries so fast, smells great and goes on evenly. I cut the end of the tube to prevent the leaking that I read about and it worked perfectly. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I had been using Tan Towels for years (which I do still use on occasion) but was still plagued with streaks and over-saturated elbows/knees etc even after exfoliating &amp; moisturizing. My co-worker uses Fake Bake and suggested I try it.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a good chunk of time reading over the reviews for tips on how to apply. I followed the directions and some of the tips from others and got a nice, even color with the first application. As of now I am using it about once a week to maintain a light color, but may try a few coats later in the summer for a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the inner straw attached to the sprayer as the top reviewer suggested, and have continued to wash the mitt after each application. I have had no leaking or problems with the mitt being stiff. I exfoliate with a Korean Baiden mitt and moisturize elbows, knees, ankles, toes, wrists....all the &amp;#34;trouble spots.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Spray 5 or 6 times to the velour side of the mitt and buff on in circular strokes.&lt;br /&gt;*ALWAYS* spray the MITT first. Don&#x27;t spray directly onto your body.&lt;br /&gt;You get a hint of color with the color guide which is nice, so you don&#x27;t necessarily have to wait until the full color develops.&lt;br /&gt;The nice scent is probably one of the thing I am most excited about, and that it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to sheets/clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints so far! Happy I decided to give this product a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the most part, however it takes a while to blend in because spraying onto the mit then onto the skin is a tedious process. Be careful if you decide to directly spray on skin because it tends to leave a noticeable circular tan.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells amazing (think coconuts) applies evenly and has a great color. The mitt is also very soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Can&#x27;t get much better than this one. I use on face &amp; entire body - love it. Never will go without this one. Just try- you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> works better than i imagined, nice brown color, no streaks,</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Works better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  No turning orange. Although it does transfer to your clothes. If you get it too heavy you can use a scrubby and sugar scrubs. Last about a week .</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is true!  I have been applying for about 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen in oranging yet!!!  Very happy with the way it makes my skin feels!</li>
            <li> If you do this correctly - exfoliating and then putting lotion. Extra lotion on the joints! Then it will come out good. I&#x27;m extremely fair and I didn&#x27;t come out orange.</li>
            <li> Ok so here it goes I ordered fake bake when I finally got it I showered and exfoliated.. I finally put fake bake on and instantly was wayyyy darker and I didn&#x27;t miss a spot.. I loved it.. the only problem is when u do take a shower most of it does come off. BBut you are still left with a little bit of a tan. Don&#x27;t use it on your face it will make u look dirty  hope this helps</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have medium colored skin, light brown hair, and dark green eyes. I tan easily, but I&#x27;m tired of ruining my skin with the sun and tanning beds. Spray tanning booths got very expensive! I&#x27;ve used Jergens self tanner foams, and other products; they do not compare! This product goes on fairly easy...I do have to ask hubby to get by backside. It lasts a little less than a week, but you can reapply it every other day or so for a gradual tan look. I would reccomend showering, shaving, exfoliating and lightly moisturing before using this product. Once your skin is dry then apply the product and let it set overnight. I didn&#x27;t have any residue in my bed or on my towels, however I did notice when showering the next morning some of it washing off down the drain. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on my tan, and it makes me less self conscious to show my legs. I have not been able to exercise this year and I have a larger bottom. I would definitely recommend this product to people who are looking for a safer alternative to tanning. I did not have an orange glow afterwards either!</li>
            <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t have a terrible sunless tan smell. Works great. It lasted about a week and i did it 2 days in a row. It is not splotchy when it starts to fade. Goes on pretty smoothly. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Great product. The applicator mitt helped the spray to go on easily and even. The color lasted and was great.</li>
            <li> Just Love this Product ! I have purchased this in the past,and I can &#x27;t believe Amazon can offer this product for almost 1/2 the price I originally paid.I turned my Sister and niece on to this product and they love it as well. You can get that Healthy look without the the harmful effects of the Sun,and if applied correctly your not left with an orange tone. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love Fake Bake...goes on perfect every time.</li>
            <li> If your skin is really dry, or even remotely dry use lotion first.  Because it will absorb into your skin so fast, and you use twice as much.</li>
            <li> I can say this product produces a natural looking tan and darkens well over multiple applications. I don&#x27;t use the spray that comes with it unless you can afford to have tanner spraying out on the surrounding areas. I pour a little color on the mitt and spread it around evenly. It works well this way for me. It dries quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it staining clothes after it has dried. My practice is to put it on before bed and shower the excess color off in the morning. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Works well gives good color BUT ONLY if you have small pours if not you have dark spots where ur hair grows and I have this so I won&#x27;t be buying it again</li>
            <li> Worst garbage ever. I&#x27;m actually msg I bought this. Listen when everyone says the fake bake looks way fafake. Orange tint. And the rest of your body is pale??umm no.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have very fair skin so I&#x27;m no stranger to the self-tanner world.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store brands to higher end products &amp; everything in between.  I still have yet to find anything I really love.  Hence, my Fake Bake Flawless purchase.  I soooo wanted to like this product &amp; I did at first.  So much, I almost wrote this review the first night I tried it - thank goodness I waited!  The more often I use it, the less &amp; less I like it.  I was so pleased with the color &amp; application the first time I used this product.  However, every single time, it seems like the color just washes off after showering the next day.  It retains a little color but nothing remotely close to how it looks after application.  I understand it uses a color guard which is part of the color upon application but it was a huge difference for me.  I also experienced the bottle leaking like some other reviewers.  Even after cutting the tube shorter like one reviewer suggested, it still leaked everywhere.  TOTAL MESS!  This has definitely been better than some of the other self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried but still not what I was hoping for, once again.  On to the next one!</li>
            <li> Love it! Plus it smells great!</li>
            <li> It gives even, healthy tan without orange.  I used it a couple times a week and everyone compliments me on my tan.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product on my legs because I wanted to make sure I got the technique down before I moved to more visible areas of my body.  I thought it went on really easily and didn&#x27;t have an offensive odor.  But...once I started using it on my arms I realized that I am unhappy with this tanner and won&#x27;t buy it again.  Basically, you cannot use this during the day because if you wash your hands and water runs down your arm, you have horrible splotches.  If the tanner comes in contact with any water, it leaves ghastly runs and streaks.  Not good!  I wanted to warn anyone who thinks they will put a coat of this on and head to the beach or pool.  You will have a unsightly red residue that comes off.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tan overnight because self tanners or even lotions make me too hot to sleep comfortably.  So, I think I will continue to use on my legs and go ahead and switch back to Sun Systems for my face and the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Works great and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it works awesome. I spray in the shower because of the over spray. the mitt helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that there is no streaking or lines with this product.  And it&#x27;s really easy to put on.  But it doesn&#x27;t really tan you either.  Just a little bit of a difference in color.  If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff! I&#x27;ve used other self tanners and compared to Fake Bake they are terrifying I usually ended up being embarrassed to leave the house! Lol.... Wish I would have taken before pictures to show the beautiful color it gave me... Oh and my fiancé even used it!!! An amazing homemade sugar scrub to use before applying mix 1/2 a cup of sugar brown or white and 1/4 coconut oil and use in the shower (or anytime) I had great results!! Will order again before ever tryin another orange sunless tanner!!! :)</li>
            <li> this is a great product! I don&#x27;t look like the speaker of the house! I actually look tan.</li>
            <li> Great product, it arrived 6 days before expected! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> OMG- end of my suffering - I am so white and dont like sun tan as I have no time for it and every summer I fear my ugly white  legs . but I love ware skirts - so this bottle change my life-  it has no annoying smeel as all other sun tanners do and application fool proof- very easy and smooth - will use it forever - love it</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It smells amazing and the tan it gives is so natural looking, no lines or orange color! I usually take a shower first then shave my legs and then apply the product where I want it, I tried exfoliating first but I didn&#x27;t like the results so now I don&#x27;t! But you apply the product and within about an hour you sart to see the results, take a shower about 4-6hoirs later to wash off the the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re left with a great color! It all depends how often you shower as to how long it stays, but on average about 7-8days. I did go swimming a few times while wearing the product and it didn&#x27;t wash off in the water! I totally reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Its by far the best self tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used! The price is right too!!</li>
            <li> It really works well and the color is great.  I wish it was a little easier to apply.  I think a lot of it is wasted in the mitt they included,  And the mitt turns green after a few uses</li>
            <li> I love this! I have very fair skin and all of the other products I&#x27;ve tried do not look natural. This one looks very natural and will not turn your skin orange. Be sure to exfoliate really well before the first application and moisturize between applications.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I bought a couple months ago but I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use because I really did NOT want to be orange or streaky. And let me tell you...I&#x27;m really pale. Well this stuff is AMAZING!!!! I&#x27;m not orange or streaky. I&#x27;m seriously in love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I really did was follow the directions! Also, after reading one review I did cut the tube to the spray top shorter. It&#x27;s amazingly easy. And it&#x27;s fast drying and smells yummy too!! I think it&#x27;s best after two coats. And of course careful around knees, elbows, etc. I didn&#x27;t bother with &amp;#34;blending lotion&amp;#34;, regular lotion worked just fine. But seriously, if you&#x27;re thinking about it just try it! This stuff is a life changer!!! I just don&#x27;t have the time for real sun (not to mention the damaging rays) or the money for a spray tan. It&#x27;s so worth it. BUY IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not before photo, but my legs were literally as white as my shorts...LOL</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST self-tanning product I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ve tried and tested numerous brands from high-end to drugstore, and with the ease of application and color pay-off you get with FakeBake, it&#x27;s a standout. One potential con is you do need to re-apply more often than with other products (as other reviewers have stated), but since it doesn&#x27;t carry that awful DHA smell other products do, I have no issues with more frequent reapplications!</li>
            <li> Love it! Gives a great, natural tan</li>
            <li> Works really well! My only caution is that you need to keep applying or the color fades fast. There is a smell but compared to other tanners I found it minimal. I use it at night and simply shower the color guard off in the morning. It took me about 6 days to build up to the color I wanted which was a light golden brown. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used alot of self tanners and so far this is number one on my list. It dosent smell bad. The bronzer n the look of it when the bronzer is washed off are both attractive. My only complaint is that I wish there was more product.  And cant forget to mention the price is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It was very orange. I applied it at about 7:00pm and the next morning my 4year old got into my bed to watch a movie  with me Id say around 8am or 9am and after the movie her was orange on his leg right in the exact spot he his leg on mine</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much self tanner but I really like this one.  I&#x27;m such a white girl, red hair, freckles so I burn all summer long and never get nice color.  This isn&#x27;t too much and the color is nice... not orange.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product, I didn&#x27;t have any problems applying and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love it, although, if it went on as a color you could see better where you missed or need to reapply.</li>
            <li> works great for bronzing</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It delivers really natural color that doesn&#x27;t flake or look orange. You absolutely need to wear the gloves and get more from amazon, you&#x27;ll need them!</li>
            <li> love it! smellls good and gives you a temporary tan, but I loved it.  goes on beautifully however, i wish they would provide two mitts. the mits wear quickly and i had to use a sponge paint brush to apply it afterwards, but I still love this product!</li>
            <li> BEST. SELF. TANNER. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hands down. mitt makes for easy application and color is great! no smell either!</li>
            <li> I am amazed how natural this product feels and looks! Does not make me smell or have sticky clogged skin like other lotion based ones do! Also, it was easy to apply without blotches near my ankles, toes, or any other dry areas! Awesome!</li>
            <li> WOW this is the best self tanner ever! seriously so great. i am not a very experienced self-tanner user and some products are a disaster waiting to happen with streaks and uneven coloring. This product is tinted so you can see where you apply it and I did not have ONE streak or weird coloring spot! It dries in about 10-15 minutes and you can jump right into bed without fear of staining linens. This stuff did not rub off on my clothes, or bedding (bedding is all white, BTW) and it doesn&#x27;t have that toxic tan smell, if you know what I mean.  I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> Peels off unevenly when it get old.</li>
            <li> The color is great, lasts only a few days, but totally worth it. My only suggestion is have a spare set of sheets for when you use this, because it does rub off onto your sheets at night</li>
            <li> Love it! Gave me a light natural-looking tan in MINUTES!! Comes with gloves, an application mit,  and instructions. They made it super easy. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Will definitely be buying more!! Nice color and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot , it stays on at least 3-4 days ( with having long warm showers everyday) !  Leaves natural glow and&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t  smell! but u have to be FAST when applying !</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! I used to be a regular spray tan customer until this product! It&#x27;s awesome and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I have loved this product in the past. I have used 3 bottles over the course of the last year and recommended it to friends and family. I love the natural look and easy application... HOWEVER the last bottle I&#x27;ve ordered has started to make me itch like crazy, especially on the inside of my arms and behind my knees. I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or my skin did, but it looks like I am going to have to switch products. I was a loyal fan :(</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product! I am a fair Redhead and I am golden tan, no streaks, easy to apply, nice smell too. Make sure you watch Youtube videos about application. Great tips. Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> I have the palest skin among all my friends but I am too afraid of sun damage and skin cancer to go tanning all the time.  I trusted the reviews and bought this and WOW!  It gives me a beautiful tan, everyone has been amazed and even my dermatologist couldn&#x27;t believe how real it looked!  I wash the mitt after each use.</li>
            <li> This was after just ONE application! It was pretty easy to apply &amp; smells awesome! I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far! I will be applying another coat tomorrow morning after I shower &amp; will maintain once a week after that. The price absolutely can&#x27;t be beat! I give it 5 stars &amp; 2 thumbs way up!  Definitely don&#x27;t push too hard on the mitt though, I did &amp; got fuzzies on me. I will be more careful from now on but this small problem doesn&#x27;t take away from my opinion 😊  Update: I just put the second coat on and holy moly!! Two days in a row to get my perfect shade!!! Can&#x27;t say enough about this tanner!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried the Fake Bake line, I am hooked!  I have used many self-tanners before such as L&#x27;oreal sublime, Jergens Natural Glow, Tan-Towels, Clinique brands, etc. and I can go on and on and list them but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;This Fake Bake is easy to use and it comes with blue gloves, and a mitt.  You spray the product onto the mitt and apply to your skin using circular motion to avoid streaking and making sure it&#x27;s absorbed onto the skin evenly.  I don&#x27;t need to stand around naked waiting for this to dry since it dries instantly! The only time this stuff rubs off is on the bra band line or bra straps.  However, the stains wash off!  That&#x27;s nice! Because almost all of the brands I have tried before have permanently stained my clothes!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tan is so beautiful and not orangey at all.  I get a nice brown-bronzed tan with this.  Once you get to the level of tan you like, you can apply once to twice a week to maintain the color.  There are also youtube videos that has instructions on applying this tan spray stuff.  This is my go-to tan product(s) as it provides me the best color and super easy application. Plus it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. I am fair skin so I have to watch with things like this. I recommend after using Fake Bake, you apply a bronzer on your skin. Any flaws will be hidden!</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many different brands of Self Tanners, I almost didn&#x27;t even bother with this one. I can not stand the orange color I&#x27;ve gotten from so many other products. But a bunch of reviews said this did not turn them  orange,s o I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Texas and most know that with the sun here, I should be able to tan without problem. True, but I am getting older and want to try to protect my skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the mitt that comes with this. It allows you to apply F.B. Flawless without getting any on the palms of your hand. I applied it to my left arm, only to see if it was going to turn me orange. It did not and I am THRILLED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower the next day and exfoliated my entire body. Applied lotion to my elbows, knees and ankles/feet. Then applied this to my whole body, face included. Now I have a nice looking tan without streaks  or looking Orange, and it smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw out all of the other self tanners that probably added up to $500, and I will definitely purchase more of this very soon, plus one for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, doesn&#x27;t cost a ton like other brands &amp;#60;which is a huge plus to me!&amp;#62; I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great color, dries fast and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Ive used A LOT of different tanners, and this by FAR is my favorite! The mit makes things really smooth and easy. I recommend having a bit of time to apply it, you really want to smooth it on evernly and make sure to get every nook and cranny. I didn&#x27;t have any issues around joints or creases. I watched several YouTube videos of how to apply and it was easy. I didn&#x27;t layer the product like some do, I would HIGHLY recommend a good body scrub once it starts to wear off especially before applying another layer. Otherwise, it fades pretty nicely and lasted me about 8-10 days.</li>
            <li> As a very fair-skinned 28-year old female, I&#x27;ve tried self-tanning to avoid the negative effects that sun exposure brings.  Unfortunately, the creams, lotions, and sprays all left me orange or blotchy/uneven.  Apply and wait 30 minutes to get dressed (with the creams/lotions) only for it to come out orange/with streaks?  Never a-freaking-gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake Flawless has given me a natural tan that is easy to apply, easy to maintain (it really does dry more or less instantly-- this is the lazy tanner&#x27;s DREAM), and easy to smell (because all self-tanners know the usual tanner &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; is really leaving something to be desired).  The scent from this product, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t overpowering either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil in the spray keeps you from getting any streaks or blotches, the price is a steal, and the tan looks so natural that a family member of mine who exclusively tans at salons will be switching after seeing how just 2 applications has given me a nice, healthy, natural-looking tan with nearly zero-effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe the positive reviews.  There aren&#x27;t many products I have raved about to friends and family, but this is one of them.  BEST DECISION EVER.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this as long as they care to make it.</li>
            <li> An awesome product!  I agree with the 100&#x27;s of other reviewers.  This is a super product.  Like other reviewers suggested; purchase the exfoliating scrub cloths and use them in the shower prior to using this product.  I believe it&#x27;s best to use before bed so the product has time to develop.  Just follow the instructions.  It turns to a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Love this spray tan! It&#x27;s my second bottle! I cannot believe how easy it is to apply. It smells decent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking streaky or orange. I always get nice compliments when wearing this self tanner.</li>
            <li> Best product and fast shipping.THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Natural looking, easy to apply, watch you tube videos. No nasty smell. Will never get spray tan again, better yet my 21 year old will save money and keep out of dangerous sin / tanning beds!</li>
            <li> Really liked this self tanner. Gives a nice color that fades well, not blotchy. Color doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as off hoped but nice. And dries instantly with no smell. But be very careful if you wear white after applying. It will get on your clothes, but it washed out.</li>
            <li> Works great and does not turn you orange!</li>
            <li> Got a weird tan on my back right before needing to wear an off the shoulder dress, tried this in hopes of blending my tan lines. Worked well for my purpose, has a decent smell, easy to use, and no orange color to it. Still have quite a bit despite using it a few times this summer, but will definitely buy again when next summer rolls around.</li>
            <li> ...the great review from one person. I decided to try Fake Bake once again. I used the Fake Bake for Face 9 years ago. It smelled horrible, but it didn&#x27;t turn orange. This one smells fine, but every time I used it I turned orange, NOT brown. There are so many fakes on this website and sunless tanners are now on my &amp;#34;list of what NOT to buy here&amp;#34;, along with Levi&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this stuff.  I love the mitt to put it on with to keep my hands from staining.  It works just like it says, with no streaking!  Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have tried in the past 4 years! Does NOT turn you orange, the tan lasts without extreme maintenance and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do a full body application. This is much better then those lotions that you have to waste a lot of time rubbing it in, washing your hands every 15 seconds, and then not really knowing exactly where you put it. I found that after 1 application for 3 consecutive days, I achieved a tan that I would only hope to get after a summer&#x27;s worth of tanning. Only downside is that after you shave, the color can sit in the spot where the hair were cut (shows up like razor burn). To avoid this, take a shower at night, a few hours before bed, apply the product, then when you get up in the morning take another shower. Depending on at what point you are in the application process (day 2 of the first 3 applications) some color may come off, but after the 3 applications you won&#x27;t notice anything coming off anymore. I would suggest keeping up with the applications every 4-6 days. But this is by far the best product I have every tried and I will never use another self tanner.</li>
            <li> So it works, doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemistry set as most seem to and it dries quickly.  Nice work .  I&#x27;d give it 5 out of 5 but it&#x27;s a touch on the orange side. Not alot and probably that&#x27;s just the way these are but none the less it&#x27;s the way it is.</li>
            <li> So, I thought that my pale skin needed a boost and even though I&#x27;d used Jergen&#x27;s self-tanner before I read the reviews here and decided to give #1 seller a try.  How I wish I hadn&#x27;t!!!  First off the color tan that I got is a definite ORANGE - remember some of those first self-tanners?  The old ones that left you looking like an orange alien?  Well, there you have it!!!  A horrid color for someone with naturally light skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the next night after I had applied it I took a bath - scrubbed with a rough wash cloth specifically made to exfoliate and lots of soap..  Unfortunately, I have white towels - which now have lovely orange streaks on them from the tanner that didn&#x27;t come off despite lots of soap and scrubbing!  So, beware of this stuff and unless you&#x27;ve used it before, have darker skin tones, or don&#x27;t mind your white towels turning orange - then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> A great tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave any streaks or spots.&lt;br /&gt;The mit made the application very easy and it was easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice product!</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly for me personally. I&#x27;m fair skinned and I burn easily when I&#x27;m outside but never seem to get tan. With this it looks perfectly natural and makes me look good and I can actually wear shorts now without wondering if everyone is staring at my legs because they are so white. ♥ this stuff!</li>
            <li> This works great the mitt makes all the difference when applying product and its a great for the winter here in the North east!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanners and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. I think the mitt you use to apply is awesome. There is a slight smell but not bad like most other products.  I will definitely use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I used to be the girl who would go to the tanning salon constantly bc I loved having that golden glow but I finally came to my senses and realized how horrible it is not only for your health but for your skin. I didn&#x27;t wanna be one of those old ladies with leather for skin. After looking on amazon I came across this product,read some reviews and ordered it. It arrived in a timely fashion.. it sat in my bedroom for a week or two bc I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with self tanners and even tho this one has good reviews I was still nervous. After being sick of being pale I finally womaned up and tried it...and wow I love it! It goes on every evenly and I like that it automatically gives you color so you know where you&#x27;re applying it. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I&#x27;m already close to having the color I want,not too dark for the winter but also I want a glow. The only problem I had was with my hands. I have the usual self tanner hands but it&#x27;s very subtle. I ordered the blending balm that a few other reviewers mentioned. So I&#x27;m waiting on that to give it another round. :) I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This order was a disaster! The sprayer wouldn&#x27;t work, so I attempted to pour the liquid onto the mitt. So needless to say, It came on to heavy, so too dark. And it really does stink, same as others, when you have it on a few hours. So, false advertising, along with non-working sprayer.</li>
            <li> I have always been on the hunt for a good fake tanner, but up until I found this product I was not able to find one that I was happy with. I&#x27;ve tried LOTS and one of the main problems I usually have is that they either make me have an orange tint or they are splotchy and look like I&#x27;ve got dirt all over me, obviously not a good look either way. After trying this product out the first day I loved it! It goes on in a dark brown so you can tell where you&#x27;ve applied it and it dries pretty quickly compared to some of the others I&#x27;ve used before. It actually looks like a real tan and smells pretty nice too! This is my second summer using this product and I will recommend it to everyone looking for a good fake tanner.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Fake Bake Flawless, it has a wonderful smells and goes on very easy. It also last longer than other ones I try. I would like to know if you have one foe sentive skin since I do have a few break outs in the bend of the underside knee. Very pleased though. Thank you Pam</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim last spring after reading all the great reviews and I&#x27;m now on my third bottle! I have naturally pale skin (Irish/German heritage with blonde hair and blue eyes - just so you know that I&#x27;m not joking about being pale!) and start using this every spring. I burn easily when I&#x27;m out in the sun and living in the deep South I get too hot laying out anyways, so this product is perfect for keeping my skin safe and getting me that tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Exfoliate first and let a light moisturizer sink in before using if you have dry skin, otherwise it can stick to dry spots. The mitt helps it go on seamlessly. Don&#x27;t forget to lightly go over your hands and feet and bend your arms so your elbows aren&#x27;t uneven. I don&#x27;t use this on my face - I just wear darker foundation to match my tan skin. I use this once a week and apply at night, let it sink in for a few minutes then go to bed and shower the next morning. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from co-workers and friends saying how great my tan looks and they always act dumbfounded when I tell them I do it myself! This has gotten on my sheets at night after I&#x27;ve applied it. but it washes right out in the washing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky at all, sinks in super fast, and a light tropical scent. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! No streaking, no orange, just a perfect color! I would highly recommend! No more tanning bed for me!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best self tanners I&#x27;ve ever used.  You may get a little pink on your light colored clothing or bedding, but it washes right out.  But the color on your skin is natural and the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.  I have used for last year and half and love this product!</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Flawless spray is my new favorite way to tan.  The application is easy and my fake tan never looked better.  Another plus is it virtually has no smell like many other fake tanning lotions.  If you need a quick, effortless than I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> So I tried this on a friends advise, I had never used a self tanner before.  I was almost embarrassed at first.  I looked at all the posts and even a Youtube video before I spent the money.  The first suggestion of trimming the dip tube was smart and also cleaning the mitt after each use.  The most important thing is to shave, exfoliate and do not leave any moisturizer on your skin unless you DON&amp;#34;T want the color to stay.  It was a good first experience and it did a nice job but I think I will try another brand the next time, a lotion based product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write many reviews, but this product is deserving. I actually am really impressed with the color that you get from this product. If you use it at night like they suggest it does provide better coverage. The color is the most natural that I have obtained. It is ten steps above what retailers are selling. You get color after the first application and go from there. I highly recomend this for those that have very light skin tones.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and never goes on unevenly. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and I&#x27;ve never had any streaks. It doesn&#x27;t really go on very dark but gives a very natural looking tan. It can be hard to reach everywhere on your back but the glove does help to reach more than you would with bare hands. I actually have put this on before going out and it has not come off on my clothes. It comes with one set of gloves and I have replaced those.</li>
            <li> This is and always will be my go to product for sunless tanning. the smell and the color and how easily it is applied is awesome.. For anyone that needs a beautiful tan that looks and smells great this is the Product for you!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the best invention of sunless tanning.. Finally someone that did it right!!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  I am very pale with pink undertones and this product really evens out my skin tone.  Very pleased with the results.  I spray the tanner directly on my skin instead of on the mitt.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to put alot on as most of it washes away the next morning in the shower.  Leaves a nice, even, light color on the skin though.  No heavy self tanner smell.  Mitt could use a little improvement as it doesn&#x27;t stay on your hand very well and it does have lint that comes off of it.  Overall very happy with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. You look like you have a natural tan. The best I&#x27;ve used so far. Put it on lightly the first time to get the feel of how it will look.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and provides a dark tan the more you use it. You build the color each day, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too intense. The color is brown, NOT orange at all. I use it on my face too, no problems with unevenness because of the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt does get a little pilly after a few uses, but it still works. I love the stuff, and it&#x27;s so affordable!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Smooth application and it does not turn me &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;. Thanks Fake Bake! I will be purchasing it again soon!</li>
            <li> I love that this product delivers immediate, natural looking color.  However, I don&#x27;t like that the product is so thin that it occasionally drips.  Be very careful with application so that you don&#x27;t drip it on your rugs.  The other downside is that the spray is so thin that mitt absorbs so much of the product.  It&#x27;s much better to apply it with latex gloves so you lose less.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and though I can tan lightly on my face, arms, and back, but not my legs!  My legs have that pasty &#x27;dead fish, belly up white&#x27;, LOL.  Over the years I had tried coloring or self tan products, but they always turned my legs a horrid shade of orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake is easy to apply using the mitt.  I shower first, shave my legs, apply my coconut oil moisturizer (Monoi oil, can get it here on Amazon)...wait for that to absorb thoroughly first, and then later apply Fake Bake.  You have to work fast with the mitt, because the product dries rapidly.  The first time I applied it, I kept going over and over the same areas on my legs and wasted a lot of the product, and ended up turning bronze orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have translucent pale skin, spider veins,....like I do..go lightly with the product.  For me, I am very happy that I am a &#x27;darker shade of white&#x27;.  Totally pleased to get even a little color! The color lasts about three to four days.</li>
            <li> What can I say that 806 people haven&#x27;t already said?  I bought this because I have an olive complexion and I tan well but, my legs are never as dark as the rest of my body.  Even though it is super easy to use it takes a couple of trials before you get the correct tone. It is pretty goof proof;however if you mess up you can use one of those disposable moist facial cleansing cloths to blend the goof into the rest of the tanned area. Also let it dry completely before doing anything. I use Tinted Love moisturizer afterwards, the two together make me feel like I stepped out of the spa.</li>
            <li> Self tanners really have come a long way! This product is easy to apply and gave my very pale skin a subtle glow. You spray the product on the brown suede side of the mitt and then rub it on your skin. It bronzes as you tan, but the tan you get will not be quite as dark as the bronze, which rinses off the next morning. I had almost no streaks or weird spots and it lasted quite well. My only complaint is the mitt slips around too much on my hands, but I have tiny hands. I&#x27;m really glad I found this. You can use it on your face too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that much better than other self tanners I have tried. The color is nice and the smell is tolerable, but when it started to fade, it looked like dirt on my skin, especially around my feet and inner part of my arms. I can&#x27;t say I love this product, but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve doing this for awhile and I have a yellow hint to my skin naturally that everything turned me orange. This has more of a brown color that compliments my skin. I saw a lot of complaints that the mit leaves fuzies. Those aren&#x27;t from the mit. It&#x27;s your skin because your didn&#x27;t exfoliate well enough. Also, When you first put it on (after shaving and exfoliating) wait about 4-6 hours and take a light shower. Rub soap on with just your hands. No scrubbing. The color will come out even and beautiful. When you first put it on you&#x27;ll notice your pours are darker than normal. The shower takes care of that too.</li>
            <li> best tanner ever, easy to apply, and looks great. It&#x27;s so simple even a man can do it. Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> While this color is great for me, I find it does streak on me when my skin is dry, and I have moisturized for a few days!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  I have tried many different tanners and I really like this one.  The applicator pad is nice (I do rinse mine).  I love the quality of the tan.  It is not a &amp;#34;bahama&amp;#34; tan but looks very natural with my tone (I am fair skin and blonde hair).  I tend to break out in an allergic reaction to all other products but I am OK with this one as long as I wait a day after I shave. One thing I&#x27;ve hated about other brands is the smell and this one has no lasting odor.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanner I have ever used....I&#x27;ve used the original fake bake and loved everything but the smell...THIS has a smell even my husband loves.  Gives an even and natural glow -- it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for creating a truly natural looking sunless tan.  The color is deep and bronze vs. orange and there is no self-tanner smell.  I would say there are two things to be aware of however - the liquid and the mitt require a little more effort in blending than a lotion self-tanner would.  Also, the bronzer which allows you to see where you&#x27;ve applied does come off on clothing/sheets and in water, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply this and go to the beach or pool without showering first or you&#x27;ll see the brown streaks running down your legs when the bronzer rinses off.  I followed the advice of other purchasers and cut the stem of the spray bottle, which has prevented it from leaking as others experienced.  I would definitely recommend doing this as mine works perfectly now!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> You will definitely not turn orange from this stuff.  It is a very high quality, there are no streaks. I definitely would recommend this, try it out.</li>
            <li> I got this to help my extreme pale skin and it gave me a nice glow.  I used it at night for a few nights in a row.  Fades after a week or two.</li>
            <li> THE BEST FAKE TANNING PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve had no issues with this product, it looks like a real tan &amp; I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> A bit messy and a little difficult to get even, but dries fast with no color transfer.  There is no ugly smell, just a coconut scent.  You should be careful to even apply with the mit around the ankles, elbows, knees as it can pool in dark spots.  Be sure and wear the included gloves along with the mit.  The color does last well.</li>
            <li> Great product looks really natural</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used!! And the only one that looks very Natural!! And it is goof proof! So anyone afraid they are going to do it wrong, don&#x27;t feel that way!! I never was good at putting on a self tanner, but not with this stuff! One thing though, I know I should have washed the mitten, the second time I used it, I still hadn&#x27;t washed it, but it came out looking as great as the first time, but the third time I used it without washing it!!! Omg! It was horrible! I know I should have washed it!! I was in a hurry we were leaving for the beach! But we had a horrible vacation anyways, it just rained &amp; rained, and was cold! So nobody saw the bad tan job I did lol..it was horrible!! Lol. ALWAYS WASH YOUR MITT!! has anyone used this stuff with only thier hands? With just the glove? Not the mitt, but just using a glove?</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tan I have ever used.  It does not streak and looks so natural.  I have gotten many compliments after using this,</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  It had leaked out inside the box before I opened it. Has a strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners. This one is amazing. No need to shop around anymore. Trust me. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product. I bought it and was a little disappointed.  It left me with a slight orange look and wasn&#x27;t that easy to put on.  It&#x27;s not bad but I probably would not order it again.</li>
            <li> This is way better than spray tan! It dries quick and no streaks!! I will be this over and over!</li>
            <li> It was streaky and turned my skin orange.</li>
            <li> Amazing results you can see immediately! Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for tanning. But they should tell you to rinse off in the morning before putting on clothes, it does rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is probably one of the best self tanners I have used.  It produces a nice natural color and does not smell overly offensive.  In addition, after application it does not bleed excessively as I have noticed from other self tanners.  My only lament is that I wish the color was more enduring.  It will fade very quickly and likely only give you color for 2 days.  This fading makes it very difficult to build color with this tanner.  However, my skin does not seem to get irritated by it&#x27;s use and it does not block my pores (thank goodness!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fake Bake for years and it&#x27;s the best out there without the strange tanner smell others have.  The color is natural looking &amp; not orange like some.  The mit really helps for a streak free tan.</li>
            <li> This item took a little while to ship, but the actual product is great! This is my first self tanner ive ever used , so im not exactly an expert with the stuff. I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times, and I love my color. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all, which I was fearful of! I missed my dark tan from last summer, but as I&#x27;m getting older and wiser (haha) I want to be tan, but not at the risk of skin cancer! This stuff looks beautiful, and is easy to apply. Just be prepared to have a little of your color wash down the drain each time you shower after applying. I apply it at night before bed, and when I shower the next morning, the water is always brown tinged. Just be sure to use a towel you don&#x27;t care about after your showers while you use this!</li>
            <li> Works very well and have a VERY natural color.  It does not smell particularly good and you can see it washing off in the shower but the color does seem to stay on for 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every self-tanning product over the years. Some worked, some didn&#x27;t. Almost all have a very strong odor. I would use at night because if you put it on and went out you smelled odd.  My husband bought this for me. I was skeptical. I am very pale, never tan only burn. This product is great. It is the easiest to apply I have every used and I have been using product for 20 years. The color makes for fool-proof application. It blends well. It doesn&#x27;t streak. I can put it on and go out because it SMELLS GOOD. Yes it smells good! That alone would sell me even if it wasn&#x27;t the best product. Do I get a deep dark tan. No. Nothing will make me dark. I don&#x27;t have the melanin to tan. I do, however, like to take the white glow off so my legs don&#x27;t blind people. This gives me a nice light sun kissed look with no hassle and no unpleasant smell. It comes with a great applicator. Spray, wipe in circles, get it even and out the door. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product does every thing found in the &amp;#34;Product Description&amp;#34; just above. Truly Amazing! I&#x27;ve gotten a perfectly even tan without streaks. It is very easy to apply, the aroma is pleasant, it dries quickly and looks like a natural tan. I can&#x27;t imagine any of the higher priced sunless tanning lotions doing any better. The mitten makes application a breeze and does not leave a mess. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on with good color &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like it  the color is good................ doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would,  washes off the next day in the shower........</li>
            <li> This works fast!  Even though the mit is a big help in spreading the product on, you still have to be carefull and watch for smudges.  But its much easier than using your hands!</li>
            <li> I love it! So easy to apply, looks like a natural tan! (I love to go bed tanning)&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Very sastified! Love this product. &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners... I am fair skinned. This is the BEST! Smells great (not the typical urine smell) &amp; you can apply in the morning. No orange or missed spots with the built in bronzer, very light feel. My sister and I are addicted!</li>
            <li> I never once got questioned whether my tan was fake - even in the dead of winter. Great product and blends with my skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have tried many a self-tanner in my day but this one goes above and beyond any I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons I love this self-tanner:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Goes on smoothly without streaking or looking blotchy,&lt;br /&gt;(2) Has a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky like most other self-tanners.  This one actually made my skin feel smoother than before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Dries really fast so no rubbing off on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;(5) It&#x27;s affordable!&lt;br /&gt;(6) Hand mitt and gloves are included.&lt;br /&gt;(7) The results are a truly flawless, natural looking tan every time. Don&#x27;t worry about that fake orange shade that some tanners leave you with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the cons: NONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this self-tanner.  I will be using it again and again. I wish I&#x27;d found out about it years ago! I can&#x27;t image using any other self-tanner now!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing !! It gives such a natural tan that does not leave you orange at all. The only reason i only give 4 starts is because i have to apply it like every other day , i wish it lasted me a week :( i highly recommend it tho!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for mine and a friends super pale legs. My friends legs are consistently pale and hairy, I applied this as directed and was shocked! It was not extreme and no streaks, when he washed very little came off and the spray has a nice scent. After such unexpected results for him I had to put it on me! I have only applied once but it has almost evened out this ridiculous sunburn/tan I recieved a few weeks ago. Where has this been all my precious pale life!! I have tried lotions that really had me scared of self tanners but I really truely suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li> So far this seems like a pretty good product. I have a slightly brown complexion and it makes my tan a little bit yellow, nothing unattractive, but not the true brown my skin would be if I went out in the sun. I&#x27;m able to get a wonderful tan naturally, but I&#x27;m trying to protect my skin these days, so this is a nice alternative. A couple things to note: when you are applying the product make sure to spray it evenly on the mitt, and apply in circles at a decent rate of speed to avoid streaks. The directions explain how to do it, so make sure to actually follow them. Another thing, my mitt started to pill up on the first use and little pieces come off at each use - hopefully this won&#x27;t happen too much more. When you&#x27;re spraying and applying do so over a non-porous surface because it will spray past the mitt and get on the surrounding area. If you wipe it up quickly you may avoid staining said surfaces. Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product, but I don&#x27;t know if it is much better than the Banana Boat Summer Color self tanning lotion that you can find for half the price at Walmart. Until the first time you shower, Fake Bake can transfer onto your light colored clothes or sheets. During your first shower you will notice some of the tanning spray wash off, but definitely not completely. In summary, it&#x27;s better than spending too much time in the sun or tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, evenly. Smells great. The color is perfect for me. No orange streaky mess!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake a few times this summer already and really love the product. I&#x27;m really pale, do not tan naturally, and have a family history of skin cancer. Since traditional forms of tanning are out of the question and really very bad for your skin, I&#x27;ve tried a few different tanning products- mostly gradual tanning lotions like Jergens. But Fake Bake surpasses them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike tanning lotions, the mess with Fake Bake is minimal! The included mitt and latex gloves help a lot. And unlike other sprays or foams, you see right away where the product has been applied so you can get an even coating. This product hardly has any smell to it either- many products have that distinct self-tanner smell that you want to wash off as soon as you put it on. Once this product dries on your skin, there is zero transfer! No waiting around naked for 15 minutes, unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into. Tan lasts upwards of a week, depending on how often you shave, and builds easily and looks natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a long-lasting natural looking glow. This product will not make you look orange! You will not smell! You will not be a streaky freaky zebra!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and this product has been a God send! I agree with other reviewers that it can take some time to get used to how to apply it. Don&#x27;t spray your mit too heavy and rub in circular motions. Use what ever is left on the mit for your feet and knees. It seems to hold up better then other sunless tanners I use. It withstands a few showers and doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easy. That is always a concern for me if I am wearing light color clothes in the summer.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very well.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best fake tan I have ever used.  My father passed away from melanoma and I&#x27;m terrified of being in the sun, but I love having a tan.  This product smells like Hawaiian Tropics.  Very coconut-y and pleasant.  If you&#x27;ve used other tanning products, you would agree that the smell after a tanner is oxidized smells really bad. This product has minimal unpleasant smell after it&#x27;s oxidized...  This tan doesn&#x27;t have orange undertones. It&#x27;s more of a red undertone.  Make sure you exfoliate throughly before you use this product.  If you don&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t really blame Fake Bake for an uneven tan.  Haha</li>
            <li> Was leaking when I got it</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, and this added an even tone to my tan lines.</li>
            <li> Why are so many fake tanners so ridiculously expensive?  Fake Bake makes high quality, affordable tanning products that are just as good as the other high-end tanners on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for years and have always had great results.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes or sheets, smells decent, and lasts for a few days.  It&#x27;s best if you exfoliate first but the product will still work well--and won&#x27;t be streaky--no matter what.  The glove isn&#x27;t very good quality and gets dirty so fast, and you have to be gentle when washing the glove so it dosen&#x27;t fall apart or get too matted.  To tan my entire body it takes about ten minutes including set-time (make sure you let the product dry a bit before putting on your clothes).  As with any tanner, wash your hands and fingers.  The product&#x27;s dark brown color makes it easy to see whre you&#x27;re applying it, and you can see results almost immediately.  I even put it on my face without any breakout issues.  You can also layer it, one application right after another one, to achieve quicker and darker results.  The Flawless shade works best with fair-light medium skin tones.  I prefer to put it on before bed so I wake up with a natural, bronze glow.  One bottle will last you a couple months with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!! For people thinking &amp;#34;I would streak myself up, it would look horrible&amp;#34;... IT WON&#x27;T! This product is super liquidy (is that a word? haha) ... You spray it onto the mitt they give you and wipe it on your skin. Because of its liquid consistency , it does not streak or get sticky. It is very dark so you have a guide as to where it is going. The smell is wonderful and it practically dries instantly! I have been using Fake Bake for years and have now moved on to using Fake Bake, Darker (which i freakin&#x27; love). This is the perfect self-tanner for those who are scared of that horrid orange color. This product gets you to that beautiful Brazilian brown we all crave. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, go for it! The price is great and I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  At least $10 cheaper than the store and it works perfectly!! This pale girl has a nice brown tan! Not orange at all!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but after several uses, I love the product.  It works best when you apply at night, after showering, then rinse in the morning.  The mitt works great and goes on even and natural looking.  I ordered one for my daughter, now she is hooked on Fake Bake too.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the mit gets worn out. I had to throw it away before my product was out.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough... this spray is great, easy to use and foolproof. Not orangey at all.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Fake Baker for two years now, which means I&#x27;ve used probably 20 bottles of this magic stuff. It really is the most reliable self-tanner out there, so if you&#x27;re new or or nervous or just looking for a great deal, you have my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this stuff is easy to put on (using the mitt - I just spritz about 5 times directly onto the mitt for each arm, e.g.) It&#x27;s also the only self-tanner I&#x27;ve used that errs on the brown rather than orange side, and that&#x27;s a plus. Final accolade: it smells phenom, like I would buy a lotion that smells like this just to be wistfully transported to Tahiti (never been, but seems like it would smell like coconuts and Coppertone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any good pessimist, however, I&#x27;ve found a couple of flaws, and offer them here as a buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;- Staining: this stuff rubs off on clothing / sheets like none other. I think all self-tanners do to a certain extent, but this will straight turn your sheets Thousand Island-colored after one restless night. It seems to wash out (although over time, the stain residue builds up), but embarrassing nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;- Build-up: admittedly I am not the best exfoliator, but if you don&#x27;t scrub this off completely before reapplying, you run the risk of serious build-up / brown flakiness (I tend to get it most in my inner elbows and neck).&lt;br /&gt;- Bad for faces: this is one of less-good self-tanners for your face, possibly because the mitt applicator doesn&#x27;t rub in as deeply as your hands might, so you can look a little speckled. I use Tanwise for my face now (anyone have a better recommendation?)&lt;br /&gt;- Mitt dependency: you 100% need the mitt for this. I&#x27;ve tried hands, a washcloth, and a sponge as backups, and they were all hilarious jokes. The reason this is an issue is that even with careful oversight and the occasional machine wash, your mitt will eventually get pilled and rough and will therefore make your application uneven. I wish the mitt lasted as longas the bottle did, because I do not wish to spend even more money on a backup applicator method.</li>
            <li> Goes on black. Scarey. No smell but need gloves n in shower. Not golden as it goes on but does tan. It would NOT tan my pale pale daughter. I&#x27;m more olive skin tone. Be careful!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, one of the best self tanners I have used it looks so natural and easy to apply! Also fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with included sponge-mitt. It will streak if you&#x27;re not careful but not much of a problem. Dries quicker than most. The only issues are that Fake Bake also recommends you buy so many other products which I found unnecessary, and the color will go pretty dark so if you&#x27;re very pale like me you might look more faked than baked. Does not work as well on the face. But overall I thin it is one of the best especially if you don&#x27;t want to wait a week for the moisturizer types to work.</li>
            <li> OK I literally have way too much to say about this stuff but SPOILER: you will buy this after you finish reading this. This stuff is incredible. Like I can&#x27;t even begin to explain. So I was online looking for a self tanner..came across a few &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; products then found this which I&#x27;ve never even heard of but the #of reviews and how every single one of them raved about it I was sold..in fact I bought the original and the darker version because I couldn&#x27;t decide. Right off the bat I&#x27;m going to say that I would recommened the darker one just because I am pretty pale and the darker one is just less time consuming for me. They literally are the same exact product I see 0 difference in any aspect of the product between the two besides it actually being darker. With the darker one I apply 1 coat and I&#x27;m good the original took about 2-3ish coats. I will probably go to the original during the summer when I am naturally tan and want to be a little darker. You can always build on it either right after ur first application or the next day it still looks great! It has the most undetectable scent it&#x27;s like a mix of coconut and vanilla but I have to put my arm to my nose to get a good smell in lol. The color is incredible I feel like it&#x27;s tailored to my exact skin tone because I look the way I do after I&#x27;ve spent a week at the beach (without the sunburn) AND my teeth look SOOO white. After my first application I went downstairs without telling my mom that I tried out my new holy grail (we are beauty fanatics and bffs) I came outside and she sat up and said HOLY CRAP YOUR SKIN IS GLOWING IT LOOKS AMAZING AND YOUR TEETH...YOUR TEETH THEY LOOK AMAZING. Two minutes later it was on her and 5 minutes later she bought it lol. Seriously amazing. Oh and the mitt is also incredible. I&#x27;ve never had such an easy application and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hands looking rediculous. Like seriously why is there even any other tanning products out there? They should all be put to shame after seeing how this thing works... I honestly feel like it&#x27;s a steal the price is unbeatable. TIP: Im not too sure what the gloves are for so they could be for this purpose but I will say it anyway. When I opened the box I literally threw the gloves to the side and didn&#x27;t give it a second thought. AFter the first application I wasn&#x27;t so quick to throw them out...the mitt moves around during application ..a lot. It&#x27;s a little annoying bc you have to go quick or else it will dry and be hard to blend. So the gloves create a nice friction that keep the mitt on pretty much completely throughout the process and it solved my problem If I were to really try to find a con the only possible thing that I could say is that the bottle could use a little updating. I&#x27;m not sure what is happening but it does leak on me and the spritzer could definetly be upgraded bc although the application process is simple and easy it is messy and if I applied it anywhere but my shower I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to write this review bc I would be dead due to the amount of stains this would put in my house. So DO IT IN THE SHOWER OR U WILL REGRET IT. But I do believe that is a bottle issue it just doesn&#x27;t always work out that great and it gets everywhere But all in all that doesn&#x27;t even phase me bc I seriously am head over heals for this product. A+, 10/10, BRAVO, costumer for life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this self tanner one, but I&#x27;m really impressed. I put it on at before bed and washed it off in the morning. It did turn my pi&#x27;s orange but washed right out. It isn&#x27;t super dark, it just looks like I spent some time by the pool (very natural looking). I even used it on my face and it looks really good, not orange or too dark. Since I&#x27;ve only used it once 2 days ago, I&#x27;m not sure how long the tan will last. Since it only took about 10 mins to apply it to my entire body I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it every week. My sister was so impressed with my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that she ordered it too.</li>
            <li> The product shipped very fast with great service, I was very excited to use it, But I was disappointed to find out this product DID NOT WORK! It sprayed on clear (just like water). Absolutely no scent. I used this product a few times thinking maybe it will take a few applications to develop on my skin, but I received no results.There is an abundant amount of positive costumer feedback about this product so I am hoping it was just a defective bottle. I looked for the seller information with no luck! If anyone can find me the sellers contact information I would like to give feedback.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this to, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s never orange, always turns out a nice brown color. The mitt is okay, it&#x27;s starting to fall apart on me, but I feel like that&#x27;s pretty normal. As someone new to self tanning, I feel like this was pretty easy to use and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now, and I am in love! I have been searching for a great self tanner for a few years now, and this is IT! The tan is never orange; it usually takes me 2 applications to get my desired tan. The mitt and spray work great together-never streaks, great coverage, easy to apply. I usually do an application at night, shower the next morning, and then another application. Tan lasts about a week; easy to touch up as well. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great self tanner!</li>
            <li> The spray and mitt don&#x27;t really do it for me, it was just a hot mess all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply, I use a few sprays in a tiny bowl and mix in just enough good white lotion (in this case, &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; by Designer Skin) to allow myself to spread the product with smooth and even coverage after thoroughly exfoliating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it do? Quite nicely! Mixing with a small amount of lotion didn&#x27;t seem to affect the product much at all. I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; shade of pale with a pink undertone, and this product produces a natural looking color on me. Not orange, not medium or dark brown, but a smooth radiant light tan glow. With the way that I apply my product, I don&#x27;t have any problems with the color streaking, or dark/light spots either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product a few days in a row (allowing it to stay on my skin a minimum of twelve hours prior to showering) to get the color I wanted - once I got to that point, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to touch up my color for nearly a week.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the product on evenly. Not sure if it was the product or me. But learned my lesson and won&#x27;t being trying the fake tan thing again. One good quality this product had was the smell. It has a tropical scent which was nice.</li>
            <li> Looked great on the legs, but faded SUPER patchy on the arms, neck and chest, even when I tried scrubbing it off. Mitt turned a weird green color after a couple weeks, but I&#x27;m assuming you have to replace it frequently as it gets old quickly.</li>
            <li> Nasty stale smell plus sticky as crap! Best color results and I like how it&#x27;s a nice unnoticeable fade when it wears off. However I hate sleeping with it on my skin and smelling that smell all night!! As soon as I wake up, I&#x27;m literally runny to the shower!!! Sometimes when i yawn a lot my eyes water and the first time this happed i woke up the next morning with streaks on my face, so that sucked. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t tan and am very pale.  I wanted to quit wearing pantyhose with dresses and feel comfortable wearing shorts in public. I like the tint in the product to see where I&#x27;ve applied it.  I&#x27;m happy with the color.  My husband even commented that I did look like I had a tan.  If you haven&#x27;t showered &amp; you get wet, the product streaks.  I put it on at night, then shower in the morning &amp; am good to go.  I did have some staining inside white skinny jeans, but it washed out.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve used the fake bake mousse before and saw the Flawless had great reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it as well. Loved it alot better than the mousse. The smell is nice and very easy to apply. Will definitely be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Natural color. A lot of the color is the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; and rinses off in the shower, but if you use it a few days in a row you&#x27;ll finally get a tan that stays. It does stain hair follicle pores on your legs though making you took like you have dark stubble. That too goes away after you use it, shave the next day, use again, sleep, shower, use it again.  It does get a little uneven on the insides of my forearm, elbow crease, etc, but a little touch up swipe  evens it out pretty well after a few hours. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use some of the face lotion on a small spot (like where you watch wore off the color or you missed inside your belly button :-0 )&lt;br /&gt;Warning: do not use if there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll get rained on - keep an umbrella with you!  Don&#x27;t even do dishes until you&#x27;ve showered. One little drop of water makes the \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; disappear - if you run to your car in the rain you will look like a leopard!</li>
            <li> No horrible smell, funny orange color or skin irritation. I only wish it lasted longer but it is perfect for upcoming events when you want a little extra color. I&#x27;ve never had luck with sunless tanning before but this product actually works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Product is great, I love everything about it...except the smell. make sure to let it dry all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells good, dries very quickly, and goes on smoothly with glove provided. Smells like a &amp;#34;pi&amp;ntilde;a colada&amp;#34; scent.  So far, this is the best and I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a lot! And it was cheaper on here than stores. Arrived in one day.</li>
            <li> Love this. I am a repeat buyer. It works amazing.</li>
            <li> I could not get this product to rub in evenly for some reason.  I exfoliated before applying and really tried to rub it on evenly.  It really soaked into some parts of my legs but not others.  It wouldn&#x27;t soak into the backs of my legs at all, which made the fronts really tan and the backs super white.  I guess it looked good in pictures because you only saw the front of my legs but looked kind of crazy in real life.  This stuff makes you tan, just not evenly.  I&#x27;m sure it was probably user error, so I think I&#x27;ll just stick to the spray on tanners.</li>
            <li> It definitely works but its you still get line marks along area like wrists &amp; ankles&lt;br /&gt;Its great for a last minute event that you want to look bronze for overnight!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Doesn&#x27;t turn orange or stain my palms goes on smoothly and it is build-able!!!</li>
            <li> It was not orange, It did not streak. It looked like a natural tan. And the price was 1/2 of what they were charging in the stores.</li>
            <li> Over the years have I tried many &amp;#34;fake bakes&amp;#34; and now here is one with the actual name. It was easy to put on with an enclosed smooth glove and left no streaks, it dried immediately so you don&#x27;t have to avoid furniture or clothes for an hour, and it left my legs brown not orange. With only one application it did wear off in a couple of weeks and it is not the cheapest but I think it well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It definitely works just as described!  Love it!  No need for fake tanning anymore! You wont be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> this product works well.  I am fair skinned and it looks very natural.  my only suggestion is to not put it on to heavy as it will streak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Fake Bake products, and this one works as well as all of them. However, it is much less messy. It is easier and less greasy to apply and the glove is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is the first &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; self tanner I&#x27;ve used on my body. First off, I love the smell! It will eventually give you that self tanner smell, but when you first apply it, the product smells like coconuts. This has great lasting power, and my bottle lasted me around 2 months with heavy use. I will say I got better color pay off with the gloves than the mitt, so I would recommend using the gloves all over and maybe the mitt for your hands and feet. Just order my next bottle!!</li>
            <li> Color is SO natural, application is SO easy and so fast! Takes me maybe 15 mins to do my whole body, comes with plastic gloves, smell isn&#x27;t bad and you can use it as much or as little as you want without looking orange.  Watch tutorials on youtube if you are nervous for your first try! No need to wait til the weekend to tan, its so easy you can do it on weeknights for a boost of color! My coworkers have told me in the past that I looked orange with other products I had been using.  This one has never failed me though! Even wore it for engagement pictures. :)</li>
            <li> I just love this tanning spray! The mitt not only keeps application clean and easy, but helps show where you already applied! I&#x27;m very pale and never tan, always burn. I recommend this to the palest of people!</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
            <li> This helped me get ready for summer and did not look fake, despite the name on the package!! A nice light brown, did not rub off on my clothes and was easy to apply with the mitt included in the box. The smell is tolerable and went away after it dried on my skin. I would use this if I were going on vacation and wanted to show my legs after living in the frozen north all winter long!</li>
            <li> I liked the Fake &amp; Bake lotion better than the spray option, but this product does work well. It&#x27;s just tedious to put on the gloves, and then the mitt and spritz and rub...blah, I&#x27;d rather just put on lotion.  The color is also finicky with this product. If you don&#x27;t get the application JUST right, the color is mismatched and blotchy looking until you take a shower. After a shower it does provide a really nice, even tan for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I would buy this again, but I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend it to somebody. It&#x27;s just more work than I&#x27;d like to invest in a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time fake tanner with fair to light skin. The process was easy to follow. The formula is great--immediate color develops, dries quickly (I have all white sheets in my bed and no stains!!!), and streaks are fairly easily avoided. It does turn areas like hands, knuckles, feet, elbows, etc. a little bit orange-y, so keep that in mind when applying. When I wake up after a night of letting this develop I am easily...five shades darker. After a shower I&#x27;m knocked back to three shades darker rather than five. I actually prefer that though, because too much of a tan on me looks a little weird. The color that develops before shower is a little brown, but washes off into a golden undertone tan.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this is the miracle of all self tanners! Being a redhead Ive been searching for years to find a good self tanner, one that doesn&#x27;t leave me orange or glittery. The Fake Bake Flawless goes on, well flawless, with no streaks! The mitt makes it easy and fast to apply. I love the immediate color it gives you as a guide it makes it perfect to throw on on the go for those days you want a little more color. The smell is AMAZING absolutely no icky self tanner smell that sticks with you all day! Ive been recommending it to everyone I know, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used!  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and it&#x27;s a beautiful and natural tanning color.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of self tanner and saw that this one got a lot of good feedback so thought I would try it.  I was disappointed.  I am an experienced self tanner and this product was hard to blend and when it wore off left streaks.  I prefer Sun Laboratories. Oh and the mitt that was included...junk...it literally started to fall apart after a few short uses.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great! Looks natural, not orange at all! Goes on evenly and dries quickly. Looks a little fake when applied to the face though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and most importantly: it gives you a beautiful (not orange) tan.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ,worked exactly the way I wanted it to, well worth the money! Have recommended it to my friends!</li>
            <li> Great, dark color. My only wish is that it would last longer. However, it was very easy to apply and see where it was, and has a pleasant scent to it (unlike many other self-tanners).  If you&#x27;re needing a great tan for a couple days, this is your stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite fake-bake self tanner. I prefer this spray formula over the foam and lotion, and I love that it comes with an application mitt.</li>
            <li> This product is not like other self tanning items. The color it appears is the color it will be. it does not get darker hours later, like most fake tans. It only lasts a few days, then you must reapply if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty even...few streaks, good coverage and tan color not orange. just one bit of advice if you have scars, scrapes or any kind of marks on your skin the dark spray will set in and illuminate these flaws on your skin. i have psoriasis and hoped the tan would cover it but instead it made the scaly spots even darker and more noticeable. but the next day it looked alot better. you can shower and excess will come off but u will still have a tan glow. sweating will make it come off easier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i recommend this product, well worth the money n its instant! no waiting for guessing what color it will end up being.</li>
            <li> The only fake tanner I use! I have pale, oily skin and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my pink undertones skin look orange.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never ever ever wasted my time on another self tanner! I can easily see me using this for life! I also use it (with the mit) on my face under my makeup, and I get lots and lots of compliments. I can&#x27;t smell anything at all (as long as I don&#x27;t try to &#x27;double coat&#x27; without showering in between... not my brightest idea) and it leaves a beautiful color! ... I had been driving with the windows down and my left arm was more naturally tan than the right, I only did my right arm just to compare the quality of the color, and you can barely tell which one is real color, and which one is fake! Love! Love! Love! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great way to have a tan without the problems a real suntan create. Once the product dries it does not rub off on clothing or sheets.</li>
            <li> I will never spray tan again! This product is amazing! Great color in just one application and perfect color after only 3! Dries so fast and smells good! Color lasts for a week +.  I finally found the perfect tanning product!  No more sticky spray tanning!!!!</li>
            <li> shave and exfoliate well. Use this one day before you want full color (although some color appears immediately and a little more within an hour). do not moisturize before or after application as the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; will wash off with the moisturizer.  The scent is mild. Once I get tan I only need to use this on my legs that never seem to tan as well as the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Needed a little color for a wedding.  This stuff worked BEAUTIFULLY.  I am super pale so I did 3 coats over 3 days.  The color guide did rub off on my sheets but washed out without stain treatment.  My tan looked great.  And I have a TON left over.  The 6 ounce bottle will last me a long time.  Super product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It smells good but isn&#x27;t too strong.  It goes on brown and stays all day.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to tan later on.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do that but it only takes 30 seconds to put on and the application glove is one of the best I&#x27;ve used for spray on tan.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. Goes on smooth, no streaks and instant color. Minimal smell. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes me brown instantly... A pain in the butt when you need to shower / shave and can see your tan flushing down the drain. Dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m a very pale person hahaha I was so scared I was going to turn orange! I did one light coat then another light coat 3 hours later! Woke up the next day to this! I love it! I have a tan !! Would recommend 10/10!</li>
            <li> some work, but worth the great results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is so easy to apply and the color is very natural. I am so excited to found this and it saves me lots of money buying spray tans. I also like that you don&#x27;t feel stick after you apply it. You can use it every day or every other day and it takes only a few minutes to put on. Very convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> Very happily this worked!  Not 5 stars because it faded pretty quickly, but if you want to look tan for a party or event, this stuff is perfect.  Left a nice, even color very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked the color it gave and the ease of application.  I just reordered and used it, and it was good, but I did not notice much color this time.  Will try again before I decide to return or not.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as stated.  Nice, deep tan.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, and have tried many different types of sunless tanners over the years (sprays, creams, etc.).  Also, I&#x27;m a busy mother of 3 children, and don&#x27;t have an immense amount of time to fiddle with application, drying, etc. of such products.  This product is amazing.  I am able to apply it quickly and easily, it dries very fast, and does not rub off on clothing.  The included mitt is invaluable!  It makes the application process simple and smooth.  In fact, I actually much prefer the type of tan I get from this product over the occasional spray tans I get at a local spa/salon.  Apply it consecutive days to deepen color, moisturize between applications and be sure to exfoliate well prior to applying to ensure a smooth, long-lasting tan.  Any dry patches of skin (ex: knees, elbows, feet, etc.) will tend to absorb excess product and effect the smoothness of the tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tan I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is a nice brown, no streaks. It didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or my sheets. It comes with a mitt but I used my bare hands to apply. Just washed them well right after. A little messy to apply but I used the tub and no problem with staining.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. It may sound like there isn&#x27;t a lot in the (smallest) bottle but you don&#x27;t need a lot! It&#x27;s already been 6 months and I still have quite a bit left. Also, I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need to reapply it every day.. Just done scrub too hard in the shower and one application will stay for 7+ days. It has a very nice color too... Not orange at all- looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, no streaking,</li>
            <li> I am very pale &amp; tanning in a salon isn&#x27;t for me, this gave me a natural looking tan for the beach. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product, only problem is the glove needs to be bigger/longer or either more form fitting!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t look orange and it helps cover vitilago on my arms.  I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. Everything. This works great! NO STREAKS! Smells great and gives a hint of color before you walk out the door!</li>
            <li> Usually use air brush tanning. Just started trying out self tanning lotions. Not quite as good as air brush, but at 1/4 the cost not a bad deal and can be used for multiple applications. More importantly, have to wait hours after air brush tanning to resume normal activities vs 1 hour or just sleep overnight. Another important fact, why air brush your entire body for an event if you are not going to a pool party or other event where you are not exposing your entire body. With this product you can just tan your face &amp; upper chest (+ legs for female). It&#x27;s going to fade away in about a week anyway. Also, tried &amp;#34;Banana Boat&amp;#34; Dark Tanner which seemed to be a little more subtle - great for last minute application the night before for a special event.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use to be all about Lorac self tanner but decided to give this a shot. Best self tanner hands down.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good actually.  The best part is you get a mitt with it so you can see where you are applying.  I first purchased this from my salon after doing a spray tan and when I ran out, my salon didn&#x27;t have any in stock so just by chance I thought I would check amazon to see if they carry it and sure enough!!  That&#x27;s what I love about amazon..  They carry everything!!  Anyway, as long as you exfoliate properly, this gives you a pretty all over tan.  It will not make you look orange or dirty like some self tanners do.  This actually makes you look tan.</li>
            <li> I did not like this tanner at all. It really looked fake. I know others have posted some good reviews. I read them and did exactly what they said do for application..but it just did not work for me. The color looked orangy, and it streaked somewhat. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Looks real and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and the color was nice but lasted only one day. I went to use it for a night out and the spray top no longer worked so I got one tan for one day out of this bottle. Not cool!</li>
            <li> As good as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> the best selftan ever !!!</li>
            <li> color isn&#x27;t as great as I would&#x27;ve wanted..or have experienced with other products. then again this is on the lower end of price/quality. not the best smell. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPLY IN SMALL PATCHES to avoid uneven streaking, etc. you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li> This product was very easy to apply using the mitt, however the spray bottle has begun to leak all over my bathroom so its very messy.  Aside from this, the color is wonderful when you first apply, not orange at all, but when I shower all the color washes off no matter how often I re-apply.  I also have this same problem with the Fake Bake lotion and I was hoping the spray would stay on better.</li>
            <li> I go this stuff on a whim after reading the reviews.  One day I went into the bathroom and thought I saw a ghost and freaked out.  It was just me in the mirror.  I tried self tanner in the past and it was horrible and I was left orange.  I tried this stuff and it&#x27;s really good and you actually look like you have a nice tan but the tan pretty much fades in a week.  YouTube has good vids on how to put it on.  I personally put the hand pad on a dry clean toilet brush to get the hard parts to reach on my back.  Yes, I&#x27;m a single male...</li>
            <li> Favorite self-tanner, been using it for years. I won&#x27;t use anything else and I recommend it ALL the time! People always compliment me on my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> gives a good natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;My hand applier glove is a bit worn, I&#x27;ve had it for a year now. I hope I can find a new one.</li>
            <li> This self tanner - seriously. It&#x27;s awesome. I have always had SUCH a hard time with self tanners. I have a very yellow skin tone and like most people, most self tanners are just way too orange/red for me. I need something with more of an olive tone, and this definitely works. It gives off a color similar to Loreal&#x27;s original Sublime Glow, which was a different formula than the one they use now. Just perfectly warm and olive, very natural looking. The smell is not too bad. Other than the shade, the main reason this tanner works so well is the mitt - definitely use the mitt! It goes on very smooth and left no streaks for me. As always, make sure you are careful with hands, knees, elbows, and feet, but the mitt definitely helps this issue. It tends to work best if you rinse the mitt after each time. Also, the color guide helps a lot for you to know where you have already placed the color, but please note that the color of the color guide is NOT the color of your actual tan. This rinses off in the shower (make sure you wait a few hours) and leaves a nice glow. It may take a couple of uses to get the full color you are wanting, depending on how dark you like your tan, but I was seeing nice color after just the first application/rinse. I feel like I never need to try another self tanner again - this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. You can&#x27;t control the stuff. It would be best if you got an airgun with it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for guys too. The color is not a orange like most self tanners, it&#x27;s more of a natural golden brown. This also depends highly on your skin undertones, if you have yellow, brown or red undertones this product will work well. My sister has more pink undertones to her skin and it turned her bright orange. Just be wary. The smell is great and not stinky at all, I usually cover it up with cologne anyway. Also, exfoliate before use AND MAKE SURE YOU SHAVE BEFORE YOU APPLY THIS. Don&#x27;t shave until after the product has dried and developed and the color guard is washed off.  I know a lot of reviewers say the color does not wash off in the shower, but I notice I look to shades lighter when I wash the color guard off but I am still tan so it&#x27;s no big deal. I also avoid using this on my face, I usually use a gradual tanner like Jergen&#x27;s on my face because this appears blotchy and uneven but it looks great everywhere else. Love having a tan in the winter and most people don&#x27;t believe or can&#x27;t tell if&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> It came out a really pretty color IMMEDIATELY after application but washed off after one time in the pool...I got this so I would look good at the pool...I was more hoping for something that actually alters your skin color. This more seemed to just paint over my body. It would be great if you don&#x27;t like actually going into the pool and just wanna sit on the side...</li>
            <li> This product was awful. The color just didn&#x27;t look natural at all and it was hard to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the regular fake bake that&#x27;s not the 60 min one and that was a lot better. Not perfect but good.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan, will purchase again. Easy to apply with mitt, a friend suggested this product to me and I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> The seller did a great job I received the product in 3 days! I love the tanner, however if you&#x27;re not careful it will streak occasionally. It smells good in the bottle, but afterwards smells like most self tanners. The color lasts about 2 days on me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Awesome, do just like the instructions say and you will be fine, don&#x27;t be the only one caught on the beach in the middle of July without a tan, no swirls no streaks, for a nice medium to dark tan, finally a product that really works !</li>
            <li> I heard about this product in a youtube video tutorial. The girl had a beautiful tan and claimed that it was from this product alone. I was at a point in my life where I no longer wanted to tan in beds and spray tanning was too expensive (and didn&#x27;t last very long). I&#x27;d tried several drug store products that had odd smells or streaked. This product is AMAZING. I swear by it now. It takes a bit longer to apply than say a lotion and it will end up on your light-colored clothing, but it washes out and it really does give you a rich, brown tan for a pretty good price. It doesn&#x27;t streak at all and one bottle lasts me about 2 months, and that&#x27;s me applying about 5 times a week. I&#x27;ve turned several of my friends on to it as well. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used.  It goes on flawlessly and looks &amp;#34;real.&amp;#34;  I have never had anyone make a negative remark about the color, all I hear is about how good my tan looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put it on after my shower in the evening, then wash off again in the morning for the perfect color.  Typically it lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I have very pale, fair skin with trouble tanning. That said I have searched high and low for a good self tanner and THIS IS IT ladies! Super easy to apply. It comes out with the color showing so you know where it&#x27;s been applied. Pleasant smell. Tan looks real and not orange at all. I will definently be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> This is my ultimate FAVORITE sunless tanning product. It deepens your color instantly, its mess free with the provided mitt, and it fades evenly. No more patchy orangy skin. The color is natural and bronze. Not orange or fake. The smell is fresh as well, it never stinks like most sunless tanners. Love love love this.</li>
            <li> I really like fakebake. I use it when I want a night out to look tanner or 2 nights. It smells great.&lt;br /&gt; The only problems I have is it streaks and comes off a lot like if you take a shower or workout. It tends to come off even after I waited a whole day (or couple.) It literally would like seep through my shirts while I worked out. It also makes me break out alittle too. I noticed as well, if I have a blemish or scab it will exentuate them. Also a tad drying of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware too like sometimes I sweat in my sleep and it comes off on my sheets and makes my sheets smell like it too (not bad but is overwhelming). I tend to sweat while sleeping and that is a huge pet peeve of mine with FakeBake.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does give you really nice color, smells great and is super easy to put on and always look super natural. People compliment me all the time when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am looking for a different one though that doesn&#x27;t come off as easily and moisturizes my body more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it doesn&#x27;t smell like a self tanner!!! Love that ! It is super to apply no steaks and doesn&#x27;t rub or melt off! The color is the best part, very natural. Soo many people complimented me on my tan and couldn&#x27;t beeline when I said it was a self tanner! They asked what it was and came on here and bought it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless self tanners out there and this one BY FAR gives me the most natural looking. If you end up buying this I would recommend you apply it at night and wash it off in the morning. I say that because after you apply it, you will look DARK. VERY DARK. I was instantly put off by how fake and awful it looked but I waited like the instructions said and I washed it off the next morning. I had ZERO streaks, and a flawless very natural looking tan. I love this stuff and I will never buy another crappy store bought brand again.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different self tanners, and this is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. Everyone is surprised when I tell them I use a self tanner because it looks natural. I spray it directly on my skin and then quickly rub it in with the mit. If you are quick you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking. I find that I use less product if I don&#x27;t spray the product on the mit first.</li>
            <li> I have used every type of self tanner imaginable from St Tropez to Jergens and this one is by far the best. Quickest drying time and best smell ive ever had for a self tanner. Also very easy to apply since the bronze color prevents streaks. Really natural color, love love love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Color&lt;br /&gt;Easy Application&lt;br /&gt;Dries Fairly Quick (About 20 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Fades Quickly (Gone in about 3-4 showers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate and Shave Before Applying&lt;br /&gt;Use Xen Tan Blending Balm on Rough/Dry Skin (Ankels, Knees, Elbows, Wrists...)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Sweat Profusely within Hours of Application&lt;br /&gt;Wash Mit after Every Use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this all winter and people have been telling them that I need to take them to the beach with me, little do they know my AMAZING tan comes out of a spray bottle. This is by far the smoothest, best smelling, &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; (The bottle does drip a little bit.) Most men would never dream of using a fake tan, but I am a firm believer in looking your best year round. Buying my second bottle soon (yes it really lasts that long!)</li>
            <li> I love this product !  The color is the best of any self-tanner I&#x27;ve used. The mitt that comes with it helps you get it on very evenly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that even though it smells great (coconut) going on, it does have that odd smell after some time. Maybe not as apparent as some others that I&#x27;ve tried but it&#x27;s still there somewhat.  Other than that, I have no complaints and love the product !!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner.  I moved from Florida to New York and I was pretty devastated to get so pale, but this did the trick!</li>
            <li> Best product for fake tan have light skin and doesn&#x27;t turn orange leaves u with a nice bronze tan. Mitt isn&#x27;t the best but its fine.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! I don&#x27;t turn orange like most others. It goes on evenly. I love the glove. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Thanks arrived before the time awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this! It really worked! As I had read online, it will rub off on your towel and shows up in your shower water, but I didn&#x27;t see a change on my skin. It has a slight smell but if you&#x27;re a tanner (whether outside or inside), it smells like tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> In my experience this product, used correctly, is the most realistic artificial tan available. Unfortunately it requires frequent reapplication (every two-three days) for me to maintain the desired shade of tan, and the color is almost immediately removed by exfoliation.This product will also significantly darken scars and acne, so I recommend somehow maintaining a reasonably clear complexion while using this on your skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this product.  I does a terrific job and the color is great.  Why did I only give it three stars?? Because every time I jumped into the shower, the color ran off.  This was without using any soap at all.  I just looked down when I first got in and the water turned brown.  Some of the color stays but a lot goes down the drain. Just so I am clear, I put this on the day before, around 1pm in the afternoon and didn&#x27;t shower until the next morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased fake bake flawless in order to get tanned up for a large formal event I had to attend. I am over the days of laying in tanning beds, and right now the weather here does not all to get natural sun. So as I thought about other options, I remembered getting spray tanned and hated the fade. So I did so research online and many sites pointed to Fake Bake Flawless as one of the best at home NON ORANGE tan you could do at home. I have tried these types of products before for weddings and the colors have never been natural so I was hesitant to try this one but, heck what was one more orange glow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise this product did NOT make me anywhere near orange, it actually, after a few applications gave my the deep brown tan that I got the last time I was in Jamaica. People kept asking me where I went on vacation and what island I escaped to, but I just laughed and then told them about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is super easy to apply. Do follow the instructions and exfoliate well and shave before your first application so you don&#x27;t have dry patches that will absorb more of the tanning product then the rest of your skin. I purchased an exfoliating cloth from my local ULTA for under five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is very forgiving as well and blends so easily. I sprayed on the mit as the directions state and wore the gloves provided underneath the mit and never had any problems with products getting on my palms. Also, please make sure to wash the mit that is included with product every few tans. I will absolutely be buying this again. If you have tried several other home tanning products but have never been quite satisfied, try this one! It will not let you down!</li>
            <li> This is a good base color, on winter skin looking for a bit of a glow. I ended up ordering fake bake darker to go over it once the base color didn&#x27;t get any deeper. I do love the mitt and the way it applies. It&#x27;s very even, no streaking, and a very natural color.. No orange here! This particular fake bake in my opinion, is best for fair skin. I live in Fl, so this didn&#x27;t do much in terms of darkening for me. It did make my butt and breast area match the rest of me though;)</li>
            <li> The smell was nice but the color did come off as a bit orange. easy to use. Wish it was a better color on me.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the best or as good as St Tropez mousse faux tan. I love that there is a pleasant smell while applying, but that I don&#x27;t smell like the faux tan later. My own hold back for not giving this product five stars is that the product leaks when I use it. I have figured out how to use the spray without making a huge mess, yet I am saddened that I am wasting as much as I am using. Should have sent it back, but did not want to deal with the mess. I will order this product again. If it is messy this next time, I WILL send it back.</li>
            <li> Love it...does not streak. Takes several showers for it to fade and it fades slowly I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy application- spray on the mitt and rub in&lt;br /&gt;  True to word, natural looking tan, no orangy glow&lt;br /&gt;  Scent is fantastic, but not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;  A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;  Worked on my legs! (I can never get them to tan, even after weeks in a bed with good lotion)&lt;br /&gt;  Dries quickly, I usually wait about 3 minutes then after application to get dressed&lt;br /&gt;  Small amount does transfer to clothing, but easily washes out in regular wash cycle&lt;br /&gt;  No build-up on knees/elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Has not worked so well on stomach and chest, which are usually darkest areas of my body this time of year..&lt;br /&gt;  Clings to pores like no other! Makes them look gigantic..&lt;br /&gt;  Watch water droplets, they def leave a tell-tale &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; on your skin from the spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will be purchasing this product again. I used it 5 days in a row to establish base, then 2-3 days/wk to maintain. I have never used a self-tan/sunless tanner before because I feared looking like an orange, but this stuff really works. Like other reviewers on here, I also recommend exfoliating before using. I would also recommend hand washing the mitt every other application. I tried to let it go for 3 days and you could really tell a difference, the product left the mitt rough and it looked uneven on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pail and have tried two other brands of self tanners that left me looking streaky and orange. I figured it was wishful thinking to get the look I wanted with a self tanner. I read about Fake Bake and thought I&#x27;d try it but had little faith. I was desperate and tired of reflecting off the sun. After applying the first application I went to bed, I woke up,rinsed off and was amazed. The next evening I applied another application before bed and I&#x27;m still in shock. The color is beautiful,very natural and this stuff is so easy to apply. I would recommend this to everyone that wants a self tanner that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would do</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this.  It wasn&#x27;t as smooth as others I&#x27;ve used.  I always exfoliate before using the self tanners so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it is the consistency of water.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this. The color is great too!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this and it didnt work at all, thought I got a defult bottle so I bought another one and now im orange after one time. DONT GET IT</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years.  I believe it is, hands down, the best product on the market for a tan from a bottle.  It is a little tricky though.  You have to be committed to do it right.  If you don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, you will have a hot mess!  Do not put it on before going outside to sweat.  Also do not wear it under light or white clothes.  I usually put it on in the afternoon when I get home from work and wear it until bedtime.  I then jump in the shower and lightly wash it off.  The color stays on, but there is no run off.  COMBINE THIS PRODUCT WITH XEN TAN BLENDING BALM!  Use the balm for elbows, knees, ankles, and around the edges of your feet where sunless tanning products tend to change color.  It gives you a very dark but natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like an oompah loompah. Bronze goddess not snookiebeast from Southpark orange. Woohoo</li>
            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s super easy to use, and works amazing first time buying this and it was amazing !</li>
            <li> Just like the title says- I am shocked! No streaks- no orange glow- just a beautiful golden brown tan! Wish I was using this sooner.</li>
            <li> I luv, luv this stuff!! Just bought my second bottle and I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product, especially for the price! I read the reviews before I purchased this and the best tip was to snip the spray tube that goes into the bottle. That way there is no dripping. I am fair skinned and Fake Bake gives me a nice golden color, with no streaks as long as you apply it correctly. You can clearly see where the product is going when you rub it on so just make sure to get even coverage and you&#x27;ll get a nice tan, usually after 2 applications. Always exfoliate before using so you don&#x27;t get any dark splotches and moisturize after showering off the color-guard. Love the tropical smell. Will definitely continue to buy this so I can look sun-kissed all year long!!</li>
            <li> Love this tanner. The mitt definitely helps prevent streaking.</li>
            <li> I returned this product. Please stop giving me this product to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and this is definitely the best. Goes on so easy, natural color (not orange) and it smells like coconut. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good self tanning product, and the best thing about it in my opinion is that is doesn&#x27;t have/cause that unpleasant smell that most self manners do...at least it is greatly reduced in this product.  Be sure to wash the mitt out well after each use, or you will have a stiff, unusable mitt after the first application.  A little dish soap or shampoo works fine.&lt;br /&gt;The tan appearance is a nice color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> Although tanwise lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t wash off in the shower as easy, FakeBake is literally the best tanner I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s such a great brown color with no orangey color at all! It leaves no streaks, spots, as long as you rub in evenly. I cant say enough about this price as well. It&#x27;s 38.00 at Ulta for this same bottle! As others stated, just snip a little off of the inner spray tube before use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product --It looks really natural! the only disadvantage is that after you shower a lots of fake tan is gone but it does look very natural!</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product smells amazingly tropical. Over time the scent fades and it doesn&#x27;t leave an unpleasant self-tanner smell. The product is fairly easy to apply. Since the tanning liquid is dark, it is easy to see where you have applied it.  The color pay-off of this product is not the best, though it says you can reapply multiple times to deepen the color. I was maybe 1-2 shades darker after one application. The tan begins to fade after the first shower, but I only noticed the fading after about 5 days from patches of color on my inner arm. These patches were subtle enough that I don&#x27;t think anyone would have noticed.  Overall, I did like this product - especially for the price. I really enjoy the smell, which is not something you can say about many self-tanners. I do wish the initial application lasted a bit longer, but it was easy enough to apply and I don&#x27;t mind doing a couple of applications to get a good base tan. From there, they say you only have to apply it once a week to maintain the color.  http://alexisraye.weebly.com/beauty/first-impressions-fake-bake-flawless-self-tanner</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and very natural looking! Even on my extremely pale skin!&lt;br /&gt;it has instant color when you put it on so you can tell if you are getting it on even! It dries fast and doesnt get all over!&lt;br /&gt;also hardly any smell! I will definately use this again and again</li>
            <li> I used that a few time this summer. We didn&#x27;t have a lot of sun. Love it, easy to apply, smells good and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; at all. Try it! I maybe going to use it this winter when I&#x27;ll turn completely white just to give myself a kind of &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34;. I have the same brand for the face, which is different because it is more like a cream. But both products works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tan well, but I have very fair skin, blue eyes, and I am older, over 50 yrs.  I cannot take any more sun, and I don&#x27;t need to with this product, it blends so well, doesn&#x27;t streak if you take time to blend, and the color is terrific.  I can control how dark I get as well, by reapplying product.  It dries fairly quickly, and if it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  I have gone to have a pedicure after applying product 12 hrs earlier, and even with the jet tub, soaking and exfoliating scrub, the tan stayed.  The smell isn&#x27;t noticeable, it is nice.  This product works as well as the spray tans, honestly, and it looks like natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It can go bad once it has been opened however, the product should be used up within 6 mos or refrigerated to keep longer.  I found the spray bottle can also open up and leak in airplanes, it has happened about 3 times.  I always double bag my liquid items, so not too much mess, but it was a shame to lose the product.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, great product.</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner ever. There&#x27;s a ton to stay, but everyone else has already said it. My favorite things about this product: 1) This dries incredibly fast. I let it dry for about 5 minutes, but probably don&#x27;t even need to. I haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off on anything as if it&#x27;s still wet on my skin. My skin absorbs it as I apply it, but it still applies smoothly and distributes evenly. 2) The mitt makes applying this soo fast and easy, especially once you&#x27;ve already done it before. I did both of my entire legs in about 5 minutes, TOPS. 3) No streaks. I have used the Banana Boat Deep Dark self-tanning lotion, which gives a nice tan, but I always had to wipe the excess off my toes, ankles, and heels, and no matter what time I applied it, I found that it would wear off unevenly while I slept through the night just from being in contact with the sheets and tossing and turning throughout the night, it would also collect in one area on my shin, which looked really patchy and orange. With this stuff, I put it on my knees and feet sparingly, but there are no streaks at all, and it dries so quickly, it blows my mind. It looks very natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product. And it doesn&#x27;t have that fake tan smell. It smells more like a coconut/tropical scented lotion, and I don&#x27;t find it to be overwhelming at all. Makes me think of the beach when I open the package. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had bought this a long time ago. If you&#x27;re on the fence with this, just buy it. You&#x27;ll be very happy you did. It&#x27;s likely the least time-consuming product you can buy, and it comes with everything you need. People ask all these questions, which is understandable, but I&#x27;m here to tell you that it&#x27;s basically idiot-proof, and extremely easy. Apply at night, shower in the morning. Don&#x27;t rub or wash it off, just rinse underneath the water. You don&#x27;t need to wash all of your skin anyway, only the areas that actually need it. Any excess will come off, and I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;tnotice any color rinsing off when I shower, but the color improves after a shower, though I would definitely not hesitate to go anywhere after applying it (before showering), as it still looks pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned and I have more complaints than praises when it comes to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- I doesn&#x27;t look too fake. Only 1 person straight up looked me in the eye&#x27;s and said &amp;#34;Fake Bake?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- The product washes right off. I can put enough spray on to make myself look pretty tan, and even keep it on for 12 hours before taking a shower. After a non exfoliating shower I can&#x27;t tell there is any left on me. So to maintain a consistent look you must put this on every single day, and if your not naturally tan at all, it&#x27;s a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON- I have a very good sense of smell and every product like this has a smell to it. Having to put this product on every day and having to smell it on you all the time is not worth it to me; it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;deal breaker&amp;#34;. The first time I smelled it, it didn&#x27;t seem that strong, in fact it smelled pleasant. After 3 days of smelling nothing but that on my skin just made things worse. Right before I stopped using the product it was like smelling gas fumes. I know it&#x27;s really not that strong but over time your nose doesn&#x27;t want anything to do with it, and on top of that you can&#x27;t shower because it washes completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this product would be better? If it actually stayed on your skin after a shower. This would cut down on applications from once a day to maybe twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave my 1/4 full bottle to somebody who was interested in trying it, they didn&#x27;t even use a quarter of it before they stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner. Believable color. Be sure to scrub it all off before applying another go around. Usually lasts 4-5 days. Two coats was good for me.</li>
            <li> I was very  skeptical about trying this. The price was dirt cheap, however, Im glad I went ahead and gave it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a drastic change, but enough to make a noticeable difference. Had no problem with applying or streaking. Plan on adding a second  layer this evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - I am very happy with this purchase. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have to tell you...I have been to tanning booths,been sprayed....NOTHING....I have bought tons of self tanners, Nothing works..This is the very first tanner that has worked for me. and the easy way to apply is just the best.  I have to tell you, I am in the middle of moving and somehow lost my bottle.  I was so upset....this is the very best, of the very best....buy it, I promise you will love it</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product!  I have very fair skin and can not expose myself to sun or tanning beds due to battling melanoma twice.  I am SUPER fair skinned and this product looked completely natural on me!  I received several compliments and had ATLEAST 10 people in one day asked what product I used because it looked so natural.  Application was SUPER easy.  My past experience with self tanners had left me with orange hands, uneven areas and streaks.  This product did not do that at all.  Looks 100% natural.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product... works great and does NOT look yellow or fake...</li>
            <li> Great Product !!!!! Will order again !!  Best tanning spray I&#x27;ve  ever used  !!!</li>
            <li> The BEST tanner I&#x27;ve used. The instant color is so helpful, the deepening is slight and it hardly smells! Granted once I take a shower I need to reapply- but that&#x27;s not difficult. The mitt makes it easy. I tossed the plastic glove after one use, if you cover your hand with lotion or body oil before using the mitt, it doesn&#x27;t stain my nails or hand. Just wash up afterwards to make certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is also ideal- looks TAN not like a rusty carrot.</li>
            <li> It provides good color but any rough spots on your skin will be highlighted. The brown mist seems to get everywhere when spraying so be sure to use this in the shower (not while showering) so you can wash down the walls. The big issue I have with this is that it washes off easily (even after 6 hours) leaving only minimal change in skin tone. For a noticeable change in skin color, it will take many daily applications which can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase every summer as long as it&#x27;s around! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanners over the years and I&#x27;ve finally found one I love. The price was awesome $13 with prime. I love the coconut smell - doesn&#x27;t have that icky sunless tanner smell they often have. It has great staying power, but not as long as some of the pricier ones but I&#x27;m okay with that because this seems to last me a while. It&#x27;s great that it comes with a mitt - easy to wash. Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate because it can get splotchy.</li>
            <li> this worked extremely well but made me ill and nauseated and dizzy. ive since learned it can be toxic since its sprayed into the air and its difficult not to breathe it in. definitely wear a mask of some sort. Gives beautiful, even color though.</li>
            <li> Great natural look. Easy to apply. Lasted me all summer. I think I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner i&#x27;ve ever used. No streaks, easy application, no terrible scent. The mitt they provide extremely helps with the application!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and all I can say is that it is by far (in my opinion) the best self tanner out there for the price. No fake tan smell, no streaks, and no orange! Highly recommend it. Even my boyfriend started using it because he saw how awesome of a tan it gave me and thats saying a lot considering he doesn&#x27;t even like to put lotion on his body!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a decent color, but is hard to put on.  You have to put rubber gloves on under the mitt.  If you don&#x27;t you turn blue.  I tried to wash out the mitt, and let it dry before putting on a second coat to even out some spots, but the mitt wasn&#x27;t completely dry, so again, it turned my skin blue.  I had to immediately jump in the shower and start scrubbing.  If you can get it on even the first time, it does have a decent color, but it is a pain to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been reading some other reviews and others are describing the color as green when they put it on.  It was a tint of green, more like a blue-green.  Most said because it was old.  Beware of buying on Amazon; it appears the product can be out of date.  Others have said it makes their pores look like little black dots.  This is also true.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t make me look orange, I look natural and i have a pretty glow. I recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;ve got alot of my friends to buy it and they are in love with it too!!!</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in only one application. I really like the mitt, it does a good job of spreading everything evenly. The scent of the product is also quite nice, it&#x27;s kind of tropical. The only issue I had is that I would get a little water on my skin while cleaning up after application and it would leave a white water trail on my skin where the spray came off. Even if I try to fix it immediately It&#x27;s still noticeable. But other than that it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for pale whiteys like me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an orange look to it, lasts for a few days. Very easy to apply, never had an issue with streaking. I use Xen-Tan Blending Balm with it and never have issues with my knees/elbows/armpits. I love this stuff and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This is closest to a real tan that I have come across in a topical application form.  It smells good, and goes on easy.  The only drawback with the brown mitt is that after multiple applications over a while it has started breaking down a little, what I mean is that little pieces of the mitt come off.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve used all types of self tanning products...but this takes the cake. It looks like a healthy brown, not orange, and the glove makes everything so much easier. I wish I could post a before and after picture! Will order more. And I&#x27;m the biggest critic I know. Highly recommend this stuff. I would definitely moisturize before hand to make it an even better even glow. Its not necessary..but its helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Does great job of coverage, goes on even and doesn&#x27;t look fake. Nice tan not orange color. Will buy again and has saved me tons compared to spray tan at tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings, works great for a tan, but the smell and how you feel the days following are almost not worth the tan. Definitely shower the night after you apply (make sure to leave on as long as they suggest) because if you don&#x27;t it will be all over your sheets!</li>
            <li> While the color is awesome and not orange AT ALL, no matter how much I exfoliate and moisturize afterwards,  I still end up very blotchy. Not bad for the price I just wish it wasnt blotchy. Also, it takes a very long time to dry. My inner elbows and thighs always always rub off after an hour or ao no matter how long I sit in front of a fan or dont move. Kind of annoying</li>
            <li> Love this tanner. Smells great, goes on easy, not streaky at all. Easy to see where it goes. I don&#x27;t put it on super dark, so it&#x27;s lasted a long while for me, nearly 2 months. Doesn&#x27;t really rub off on clothes, not unless you get super sweaty with the color guard still on. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I just purchased their Flawless Dark, excited to see how that product turns out as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the colour that shows on my skin.</li>
            <li> Really natural looking, easy to apply. The only downfall to an otherwise great tanner is that it doesn&#x27;t really last more than a day. It&#x27;s great to use if you just want some color for an event, but if you are looking for something to maintain color over time, you would have to reapply this one almost daily.</li>
            <li> My skin became instantly tan in a really short amount of time.  It works really well, I love it and I highly recommend people try it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, however, the bottle is defective. Even with trimming the long tube as others suggest, the sprayer does not work correctly- product goes everywhere! Half of the product is in the shower...basically everywhere but on my body!  And in liquid form, it is necessary to have a functioning bottle. So disappointing... The formula is better than any $$$ product I have used, but the bottle is so poorly executed I can not recommend. What&#x27;s worse, is the vendor continues to ship out defective product.</li>
            <li> I really like how the color looks, It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange. But If you get it wet it comes off... I would put it on then go to work and wash my hands and if the water gets on your arms your arms are two different shades, and possible spotty.</li>
            <li> Works instantly, I have some white sun spots and this blends well!</li>
            <li> Wife uses this product . She loves it !</li>
            <li> The color is great but it does wear on the sheets. You need to apply more than once a week if you shower daily. It did irritate my veracious veins behind my knee. It does smell better than other brands.</li>
            <li> (Girlfriend&#x27;s review) This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> perfect as others have stated.  tan looks natural. easy to use</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunless tanner. It goes on easily &amp; comes out with AMAZING color. Scrub down and dry off, pull up your hair, brush your teeth, get your shaving done... put on gloves &amp; apply! Start at the feet &amp; work up! Leave on over night, shower in the AM and BAM amazing color!</li>
            <li> Gives an amazing tan!!!  No orange and not streaky.  It comes with a mit.. spray the tanning liquid on to the mit and rub where you want the tan.  Careful around your wrist wrinkles and not too heavy on elbows and knees.  This product is amazing!!  I put it on before bed (does not again sheets or clothes) and when I wake up after I wash my face I have a beautiful tan!!</li>
            <li> I used to go to the tanning beds for years and quit going about 4 or 5 years ago because of what it was doing to my skin. Spray tanning is ok, but it can be expensive. I tried this for the first time this week and love it. I agree with some of the other posts, the bottle will drip, but I did what another reviewer recommended and cut the plastic tubing about 1/2 inch and that seemed to help. This went on extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t make me look orange at all. It will darken up with a few hours so don&#x27;t apply too much. It had a pleasant smell and wasn&#x27;t over powering. I did take the advice of someone on here that said to exfoliate before using. I think this product beats the tanning beds and spray tanning by a mile. Would def. buy again.</li>
            <li> Great Color! Very Natural Color! I try to tan the old fashion way but living in the Pacific Northwest it&#x27;s not always possible to get enough sun. Fake Bake blends my tan lines perfect and it&#x27;s easy to use, I look like I have a perfect line free tan! I have been trying many many tan products for my upcoming wedding and this one gives the most natural color.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times following directions exactly and each time my skin looked splotchy and it eventually came off unevenly and made my skin look even more splotchy! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff because I was looking for &amp;#34;the holy grail&amp;#34; of self-tanner. I&#x27;ve had some interesting experiences with self-tanners in the past and was ready to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. This seems to be as close as I&#x27;m willing to look and it did not dissapoint! Smells great, gives a perfect brown bronze with no orange, the applicator mitt works great! I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let these things deter you from buying because this product is great but the bottle does leak if you keep it in a drawer like I do, I just keep it in a ziplock and I&#x27;m fine, it doesn&#x27;t leak THAT much but it does a little.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read a review about cutting the bottom of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; piece that connects to the spray head and that reviewer is right! The straw is too long for the bottle but cut it about an inch or so at the bottom before you use it and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The best of selftanners, as says my wife.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and really lovely results.  I go between this and St. Tropez dark mousse...both give natural looking results. Always get compliments when I take the time to self tan!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to tan anymore, worried about the effects. I bought this product after reading many great reviews and it did not disappoint. I do not have a lot of experience with self tanners, but I still know what looks good and what doesn&#x27;t. With the help of the mitt this product goes on evenly and easily. I never have a problem with steaks, just be careful with your hands and wrists. I also don&#x27;t put it on my face. I did a couple times and each time it just made my face look dirty. The color settled in my pores and didn&#x27;t look even. So I just rely in my makeup to match my body, and that works great. I marked off one star for the mitt. As far as the mitt goes, it&#x27;s not a very good mitt. It starts to fall apart leaving little pieces all over your body when u rub it in. And seems to not work as well over time. It&#x27;s not a big deal, just takes a little bit longer to apply with the mitt trying to fall apart. I think id like to try a different mitt, but haven&#x27;t.  The whole process is very quick, maybe takes me 15 minutes, including shower. Do this at night before you go to bed. Shower, shave, exfoliate. Dry off completely. I will use a blowdryer on my body to make sure I&#x27;m thoroughly dry. I put a little lotion on knees, elbows, ankles, wrists.  Apply gloves (not included). Mitt in one hand, then spray on mitt and rub systematically all over your body. I lastly lightly rub mitt on the top only of my hands without any extra spray. I wait for it to dry, then hop in bed naked. You can wear light loose cloths if wanted. Next morning shower it off, then lotion. The color is great. And the part I love most is it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes. I have even not showered the morning after and it never stained my cloths, even with sweating. I reapply every so many days, or nightly for a darker tan. But one application is dark enough. I usually only use this every few months when I care about how white I am. Which is very white! I live in a very cold place year round, so my beingwhite is only a concern when I travel out of where I live. But I have used this product often. The point of this is, I still an on my first bottle. It is getting hard to spray out of and I will need to get another one soon. But this has lasted a long time. Great product, great price, maybe get a different mitt.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Fake Bake at a Beauty Salon and loved it.  It is easy to apply, dries quickly and stays for about a week.  I ordered this for my daughter (at about half the price) and she loves it too.  It is nice to be healthy and tanned at the same time.</li>
            <li> My first time using a self-tanner. Love this product! Definitely picked the right item! No streaks at all. Great color too! I used the Xen Tan balm on my elbows/knees/feet/hands as someone recommended in a review and it worked great. The balm isn&#x27;t cheap (it was originally priced at $90 but dropped to $50 on Amazon a few weeks ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt that comes with the Fake Bake started to leave little fuzz on my skin (I had to carefully remove it). I went back to that girl&#x27;s review and it looks like maybe I should have shaved my legs to preserve the mitt. She also recommends washing the mitt after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone! Seems like a much safer alternative to going out in the sun and the color of my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange at all. So happy :) I&#x27;m no expert with applying this stuff and it worked out beautifully!</li>
            <li> This stuff works fine but makes your pores look dirty. And if you sweat at all ever you sweat it out and then have blotches everywhere.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The guard works fine and I get a day of better looking skin.  Wash it off - and no tan.  Not even after 4 days in a row.</li>
            <li> Gets on white clothes and does not last vary long. I still tan but less. Also it does give a great color.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this Fake Bake Product.  I like that it&#x27;s not oily, it dries fast, and the color is great even for such pale skin like mine.  The only downfall is it will rub off on fabric; which I think is to be expected with any self tanner.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied it right &amp; within minutes, I was tan. When I woke up this morning, I was bronze. Looks so natural. I love this product. Will be buying again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have used every fake suntan product under the sun (no pun intended).  This stuff is the best.  Great color, long lasting and it smells really good.  I simply can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy to get a healthy tan look without being in the sun.  I love how easy it is and it doesn&#x27;t have the awful smell some products have.</li>
            <li> Awesome! The best spray tan I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Make sure you spray fake bake on the glove, not your skin.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product via youtube and it is the only self tanner I use now. The color is not orange and I can apply it easily. The color gets a little splotchy when it is fading but if you exfoliate once a week and re-apply the color comes out even. I always had a hard time tanning my inner arm and this works great!!  LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Gives you a beautiful tan.&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy but the color on your skin after application is beautiful</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite self tanners! It smells great, has beautiful color and It&#x27;s a great price. I will continue to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It works so well!! You just have to be careful especially after you put it on. If it gets wet you will have water spots. It beats the risk of skin cancer one day!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to apply, washes off in the shower.  My bottle leaks out the side when I spray it which is annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and looks very realistic. I will definitely be ordering it again. Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t skip the exfoliating step before application, though, it won&#x27;t apply evenly and can make your skin look kind of dirty instead of tan.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;ve found that I need to wait at least ten minutes after application to put on a bra, otherwise the straps get stained brown. Other than that you can get dressed almost immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, they have a similar product for the face, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I would stick to this, but it requires a little more upkeep if you wash your face twice a day like me. I use an exfoliating face wash, then apply toner, then Fake Bake. Wait at least ten minutes before applying moisturizer or make up so that you don&#x27;t smudge the product. I have to do this every day, but if you wash your face less, you can probably get away with less frequent applications.</li>
            <li> Great product goes on so evenly and smells beautiful. Hightly recommend. And is such a decent price. Easy application. Love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the results are fantastic!  I bought it to tan my &amp;#34;wedding cake white&amp;#34; skin in preparation for a cruise.  You do need to be careful and not wear white, because it does rub off.  But in terms of coverage and staying power, it&#x27;s very effective.  It lasted through two dips in the ocean (about 2 hours each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell.  I have purchased this item several times.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product, and the first time I bought it was a year ago - it really lasts! I am super translucent pale and just one coating is perfect for me, it&#x27;s a nice, even color and makes me not look so dead. The mitt it comes with is GREAT - it really helps smooth the product on evenly - no streaks or runs, just smooth application. One coat lasts about a week before fading. It&#x27;s the best self-tanner I have ever purchased, definitely my HG self-tanner.</li>
            <li> So i recieved this on friday and applied it the next day after my shower. i waited about 15ish minutes before putting on a robe. i wore the robe for awhile before i put clothes on. The tanner never rubbed off on any of it. I did apply this to my face. I sprayed the mitt and patted it on my face. it didn&#x27;t turn out orange. I washed my face that night and it was fine. I had no streaks nor any orange. I washed my body the next day and again no streaks nor orange. I know it says not to put anything on prior, but i did put on baby lotion and let it dry before doing the tanner. Everything turned out fine. I love the price of this product and i will defintely buy it again. i highly recommend it. First product i have found that is orange and streak FREE.</li>
            <li> Excellent and natural color. Not orange like many self-tanners. Turns skin a more brown tinged tan.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t smell like so many self tanners do. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This really dried out my skin. Caused me to flake and then look patchy so I ended up not using it very much at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It give you a nice natural, even color.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Used to tan before a wedding. I know on the bottle it says you would only need to retouch weekly, however I felt like I needed to retouch every second or third day in order to retain my tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how good this works.  I&#x27;ve used other self tanners before and this is the best so far.  I just shave and exfoliate before applying, moisturize and apply with the foam mitt. I think it looks better to apply it two days in a row.  Like with all fake tanners it smells okay when applying but has that weird after smell.  I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs and am careful around knees and ankles or it makes it really obvious.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best bronzer I have bought.  Gives me great color and no streaking.  I have had so many complements. People can not believe it&#x27;s a spray tan when I tell them. I&#x27;ve already bought two bottles.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is fantastic for a quick touch of color.  It is just temporary and will wash off in your next shower and transfer to your sheets at night.  However, it is as easy as slipping on pantyhose to make your legs look freshly tanned vs. white as a ghost.</li>
            <li> cant believe i didnt discover sooner</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this to anyone. It smells and makes your skin turn orange-ISH. And yes, i followed the instructions carefully. There was just no way this product was going to live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, looks natural not orange</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of self tanners. None of them compare to this. It goes on dark, so you can really see what and where your applying it. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong self tanner odor, like most I&#x27;ve used. I really love how dark it gets you and instantly!! This is my new go to self tanner!!</li>
            <li> Ruined clothes and sheets</li>
            <li> This works great! Looks very natural and with no streaking. It lasts with even tone and color for over a week. It gradually fades over time, but evenly, no blotchy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really looks like you went to the islands and sunbathed for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This supply lasts for a REALLY long time. I&#x27;ve done several applications and I still have more after a year of casual use.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li> fabulous tan! WOW loved this product, nothing close to orange, perfect balance, the tan develops to MATCH your individual skin tone, and my problem area had always been around my ankles and face. this seemed blotchy when i put it on first but when it develops over night then wash it off in the morning, it leaves a perfect even tan. thats the deal breaker for me. it is perfect for all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Best tanning spray I have ever had! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and after having it on for 8 hours and showing the color was still on. The only down side is it does get on clothes or blankets if you sleep in it. I suggest just wearing clothes that you don&#x27;t mind it getting on.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. My friend swears by this product but I found it to be way too messy.</li>
            <li> Instant tan, love it!!</li>
            <li> Breast. Absolutely no orange and natural tan.  I will continue getting this product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fake tanning product I have ever gotten. With high chances of skin cancer in my family, this is the only way I will ever look tan! It&#x27;s an instant tan so you can see right away! flat out Awesome!! It&#x27;s a very big bottle too so well worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  There is no bad smell, which is a first for self tanning products.  It goes on very smoothly with the mitt that is included, and it has a slight tint so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  After initial application your legs have a bit of color, which deepens with time.  No orange color, no streaking - it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Love the color and ease of application.  Repeat purchaser. Always buy one to have on standby!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. A+</li>
            <li> I think my title should say it all.  Love this product.  I also got Fake Bake for faces - and I love that stuff even more.  I have very sensitive skin and I had no issues or break outs.  I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer on face after using it.  I would definitely buy these products again.</li>
            <li> Have tried numerous self tanners.  From cheap to high dollar.  They were all very orange looking and never looked natural.... then I ran across Fake Bake Flawless.  So glad I did.  I love it.  Looks so natural and if you moisturize daily will look very natural for at least a week.  However, you must exfoliate before you use it the first time and I used unscented lotion before I applied to keep knees, elbows, and ankles from being too dark.  The mitt does the trick.  Makes application a breeze.  I clipped the tube on the sprayer before I started and have had no problems with it being messy.  I rinse the mitt after each application and drop it over the spray bottle to dry.  Now I can tan, look natural and not dry out my skin!!!  Don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else.  By the way I am a very fair skinned Red Head!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the amount of positive reviews. I has a great smell, but no matter how much i put on, I barely got any color. Also, i tried very hard to apply it correctly, but it was so streaky everywhere. i&#x27;m not a fan of Sunlabs either (Streaky as well) but that atleast will give you color.</li>
            <li> I have put it on twice now, while following all the directions (including exfoliating), but each time it just all rinsed off in the shower. The only reason I gave two stars is because I guess you can use it temporarily to look tan for one day until you shower again. I also kept it on over night.... Still no difference. I do like the mitt though, so I ended up buying a different self tanner and used the mitt with it.&lt;br /&gt; Then again, you can get those mitts anywhere.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Instant results were fantastic. I am working on building the tan. No foul smell!!! Does leak a little when using, even with trimming the plastic tube inside. Overall I would highly recommend for anyone. I am very pale and I did not turn Orange or abnormally tan!</li>
            <li> Pretty good self tanner. The color is nice and looks like a natural tan. Way less orange than a lot of products out there. It doesn&#x27;t seem to spot when it wears off either. The mitt is good because you can blend but it is more work than spray on.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is the most natural looking, streak-free self tanner I have used. Super easy to apply too. I did it for the first time on Friday night, showered Saturday, and reapplied. I read online you only have to apply once a week to maintain after the first initial days. We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s true! Only giving 4-stars for now because I have only used it twice. I&#x27;ll be back to update.</li>
            <li> The only fake tan I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my porcelain skin bright orange. Extremely pleased</li>
            <li> great product!  will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works really well, easy and fast. follow instructions because you do need to watch for knees and ankles. Overall great product for the price. I would use again.</li>
            <li> I applied the product per the instructions and even exfoliated with an exfoliation Japanese cloth before applying the product. I applied the product twice in one day, after drying in between applications, and did not shower until 24 hrs. Because i have fair skin i was concerned the color might look to orange like many other self tanners on the market. I purchased this product based on the great  reviews. I believe it was a waste of money and i have not attempted to use the product again. After i showered, more than 24 hrs later, i was expecting a light to medium tan after two back to back applications. After i took a shower it washed off the color guide and there was no change in my skin color. Too much money and effort to go through for no visable color change.</li>
            <li> This seller did a great job getting me this amazing product! Luv the mitton and gloves, moreover the product makes my face look flawless .. I can&#x27;t say that amout any other products!</li>
            <li> This works very well and is very easy to apply. No streaks at all. The more you put on, the darker you get but it&#x27;s easy to gauge because you can see the color immediately. I put it on at night after a shower, go to sleep on my white sheets and so far haven&#x27;t seen any stains. The following morning I take another shower and the excess color washes away but the tan stays. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> No streaks, no problems. Great alternative to sun.</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I have ever used! The applicator glove allows you to rub it in to ensure no streaks! It doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint like many other either. And the whole bottle lasts a long time. Awesome value and awesome product!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little more streaky than I thought it would. The color is really great though. No orange skin.</li>
            <li> This is great. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have been using and tried every self tanner on the market. After having skin cancer ... No more sun for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I get the best results from this product if I scrub while in the shower  then apply lotion to my whole body( Olay)&lt;br /&gt;Take your time when applying.... I do both - spray on mitt or my body. Rub it in and do small areas at a time. It dries super fast !! I put on my pjs then go to bed. Please let me warn you that you will see the guide wash off in the shower..... Only wash with soap with your hand or you will wash off your beautiful tan!!  Get put of shower and lotion up your whole body. The more you keep your skin hydrated the longer your tan will last. I re apply 2 times a week depending on how deep of a tan a want!</li>
            <li> I decided I would try this self tanner after reading a ton of reviews. And I love it! I have recommended it to all my friends. It applies so even and smooth. I get compliments on my tan from people. That tells me it looks real, not orange and cakey. If you are considering trying this I would totally recommend it! I am pretty fair skinned too. Just to give a little back ground.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner!  Dries fast, not orange, no streaking and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale girl, freckles, blue eyes etc. The only color I get in the sun is red/pink and more freckles. Even in a tanning bed. This tanner is awesome.. You can control the amount applied way more than typical lotions. NATURAL looking (keep in mind this is on practically glow in the dark white girl skin...!) and doesn&#x27;t fade unevenly like most other spray/lotions. One spritz per area gives me a subtle healthy glow. Repurchased the same week I started using the first bottle. Only downside (like with all tanners) is that it smells when it&#x27;s developing. But that&#x27;s unavoidable. HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used. I have used many different brands, both high and low end, and this is the easiest to apply and most natural looking of them all. I&#x27;m very pale and the color result of this is perfect. It smells excellent. It&#x27;s easy to apply. It&#x27;s great for building up a tan over a few days; You&#x27;re not going to apply it once and look like a crazy orange person. Other reviewers mentioned having issues with the bottle leaking and suggested cutting the straw that goes in the bottle. I went ahead and did this right off the bat and had no problems with the bottle leaking. Would absolutely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this product! No streaking, had a very lightweight feel and dried quickly.  I have used several different types of self tanner and this has been the best by far.</li>
            <li> I am as white as a ghost usually but I am having my engagement pictures taken soon and didn&#x27;t want to blend in with the white skirt I planned on wearing.  I was a little worried with a spray tanner that I would look orange, but it looks really natural!  You just have to be sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots, after my first application I didn&#x27;t really get around my mouth very well so I looked funny for a few days with a ring around my mouth.  I also didn&#x27;t get my hands evenly and one was darker than the other.  But if you apply and rub in thoroughly, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.  This product goes on smooth and actually smells really good!  Big fan of Fake Bake!  I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Just buy it and don&#x27;t get pissed if you arent careful enough and get it streaky.  If you follow the directions you will be fine and it will look amazing. Go lighter at first if you are worried, thats what I did and you can always use a little more and get a little darker. Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> THE best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!! After reading reviews that deem this as one of the best (especially on fair skin), I decided to give it a try and am SO glad I did.  After only one application, it gave me a nice golden color that was even and lasted through a couple showers (I exfoliate everyday) without seeming to fade.  It actually did not rub off on my sheets after a nighttime application and given ample time to dry (I did a touch test after about 15 minutes and was dry), but did on the waistband of my pants just slightly the next day, not doing anything to the color already on my skin.  I think I&#x27;m a new faithful!!</li>
            <li> looks like a real tan. love the mitt and smell is great compared to other self tanners!</li>
            <li> By far the best self tanner I have ever used! Color is great, application soo easy.  Not orange at all and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> This tan is perfect for me. Very natural looking and can go as light or dark as I want. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two so far its about time to order again!;)</li>
            <li> Worked well and I appreciated the mitt for applying the tanner to my body and the odor was better than some others I have tried but for some reason all the little sunspots I have on me from not using sunscreen when I was a teenager&lt;br /&gt;Turn very very dark ! I looked like a Dalmatian dog ! Oh well, I guess I am just going to be very pale from now on because my body just turns red instead of tanning when I am in the sun darn it !</li>
            <li> The best sunless tan lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.  This goes on so easy.  It doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;that scent&amp;#34; that others have.  It dries fast and isn&#x27;t tacky.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  Once, I did get a little on shirt but it actually washed out.  I&#x27;m still careful because you never know but that time on that fabric it was okay.  It looks great.  It doesn&#x27;t streak even on the top of my feet.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing... easy and gorgeous color... there is a smell until you shower though... it didnt transfer onto my new white sheets either!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used and I will buy again</li>
            <li> First self-tanner that works!  No streaks / No smells.  Put it on before bed - shower in the morning - and you&#x27;re tan!  Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love fake bake products and this was an amazing price for this product.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It shows where it goes because the color of the product is a glowing bronze color. It is dry with in minutes and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. It doesn&#x27;t streak or turn you orange either. I also loved that it came with the applying glove. I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> Looks fake...followed directions and it was just a messy streaky nightmare</li>
            <li> Easy to use, make sure you use the gloves! Pretty much spread a (dark) towel out, sit and stand on it and spray on the mitt or directly on your skin and rub into your skin! Gives an awesome glowing bronzed look. It does small amounts of glow/tan over time so don&#x27;t expect a drastic change but once it dries it does not get on any clothing I have found so far. So I put it on before I go out sometimes. It smells wonderful but also make sure you trim the tub that goes in it to the correct length so it doesn&#x27;t leak! Almost finished with my first bottle :) Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> its a very good tan ,, i actually order this one and by mistake they gave me the flawless darker that was a bummer but when i tried the flawless darker its just as good so thanks anyway ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for roughly a year. I tried it because of all the raving reviews. I used it in the summer about every other day and I got very tan. When it starts to fade in the creases of your arms and around your neck it looks very splotchy. If at any time after you put the tanner on during the day you get wet it will run, which really bothered me. I would say inorder to keep the tan you would have to apply it every other day. It is a very natural color. It does not have a nasty self tanner odor. It goes on very well. Overall I like the product but it could last longer!</li>
            <li> Read everyone else&#x27;s reviews. its exactly right. Im fiar skinned ginger gal. i used to use the jergens lotion to get a color because it was the only thing that didnt make me orange. I cant tan, even if i wanted to. but this stuff, even after the first application. most amazing looking tan ever. I dont understand what voodoo magic is does to keep it from streaking but its really easy to apply and flawlessly. Buy it. youre read reviews to find out like i did. for for it</li>
            <li> I bought this product very excited at how great I heard it was.  The color of bronze is really beautiful but it&#x27;s lasting power has little to be said for.  Make sure your skin in clean, do not apply lotion before otherwise it will streak.  I think it&#x27;s a great product if your going out and need a quick tan.  But it seems to wash off immediately with your next shower.  I am a regular spray tanner which will last so much longer.  I thought this product would be a solution to spending the time getting sprayed and driving there and back.  So great short lasting color if your in a pinch and can&#x27;t get your spray tan.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to put on with out using additional moisturizer. It also is very orange. You have to be to careful around your knees, ankles, elbows because it is worse than other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried. It deposits very dark on these areas and hard to rub off. It&#x27;s just to unnatural looking for me. To much orange tint.</li>
            <li> First, let me say this is absolutely the best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Next, let me (not that you asked) advise you to not over-do it.  DHA, the tanning agent in products like this is in and of itself NOT HARMFUL really if your not bringing it into your lungs. So the general advice is keep it away from the eyes and don&#x27;t inhale it. Which is why the mitt is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the second ingredient, Dimethyl Isosorbide, is an extremely great ingredient used in the cosmetics industry because it breaks down surface fat molecules and &amp;#34;hitches a ride&amp;#34; into the living layers of the skin, carrying with it whatever molecule the manufacturer has bound to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, that would be the DHA. Following so far?  DHA has been found to be deposited in the lung and other tissue thanks to this great vehicle.  This is why Fake Bakke gives an amazing tan, it goes pretty deep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in fact NOT a negative review. I use the product, I love the product.  I&#x27;m just adding a little sanity to the love festival to say it&#x27;s great to use once in a while, and be careful around the eyes, don&#x27;t spray it etc...  Health First.  Liver problems, cancer... it&#x27;s all in the research on these chemicals. Educate yourself, being brown isn&#x27;t worth your life.</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of self tanners and this one is by far the best. The best thing about fake bake flawless is that it dries very, very fast. In 5 min you can get dressed and it doesn&#x27;t mess up your tan or leave lines. It will sometimes get on your clothes like your bra straps ect but washes out. It also does not leave a nasty smell after it dries and has a very light coconut smell going on. In the end you never look orange, ever. It&#x27;s really amazing and I love it. I get about 7-8 uses out of the bottle and use it about every 4-5 days and I stay pretty dark. It&#x27;s actually cheaper then the tanning bed in the end and no wrinkles or risk of skin cancer!</li>
            <li> Now i have been using fake tanners for years and this is hands down the best  yet !!! it turns you  a natural golden brown not a hint of orange :) and that i was very happy about . it smells good and drys fast  it also showed up earlier then its arrival time  i will definitely be buying this again whenever i run out :)</li>
            <li> So I was in the market for a good self-tanner, and I decided to buy this one based on all the great reviews.  I have fair skin, and red hair, so I don&#x27;t tan very well in the sun and the tanning bed gets expensive and is not healthy.  I was very excited to get this self-tanner and try it.  I ordered it from Amazon, which was the cheapest I could find, and I like how my items always ship very quick, I have it like two days later.  So I took a shower that night, and exfoliated very well, like you are supposed to and I applied it after I got out of the shower.  When I opened the bottle, I could smell the scent, which is tropical/coconut, like the description says.  So I applied it and was instantly amazed at the results.  No orange, it was a deep rich brown color on me, it was perfect....but there are some problems I have with it.  First of all, once this stuff settles on you, the tropical smell leaves and you smell like...chemicals.  If you ever got a spray tan (I&#x27;ve had a few), you should know what DHA smells like, and it stinks, and that&#x27;s the after smell of this stuff.  Second of all, my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; came off in the shower the next morning.  That&#x27;s when I learned that the deep rich brown color, is the color guard, pretty much an instant bronzer that guides you in applying the stuff evenly on your body.  I did apply the stuff all over my body, including my face, yes, for the most part, it does go on very nice and even.  I did notice like two small spots on my face that were darker than the rest of my face, but my skin could be really dry in that area and I can cover it with makeup so that was not a big deal to me.  Also, if you use this stuff on your hands/feet, do so very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, the bottle says to reapply for darker results, which I plan on doing the next couple nights to see if I notice a significant difference or not.  If I do, that&#x27;s great, if I don&#x27;t, then I will save this stuff for special occasions.  As of right now, I believe the stuff isreally great if you have something special that you want to look nice and tan for (wedding, date, party, etc).  It does dry very quickly, and I have not had a problem with it coming off on my clothes.  Despite many other reviews saying to shower at night, apply, let settle/go to sleep, and shower again in the morning...instead you could shower in the morning, apply this stuff, and you would have a deep rich tan that lasts all day.  But if you are looking for something more long-term, I would look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews before purchasing this product, but I am not impressed with this. The only good thing about this product is that it smells good, and it is easy to apply with the mitt. The liquid leaks everywhere from the bottle and it&#x27;s just a mess. I am quite pale, and I was happy with the initial application as the color guide is a nice, bronze color. But the next morning after showering, I was left with a very light, orangey color. I thought maybe I did not apply enough, so I applied it for the next 2 nights, but still not much of a change. It also started to get patchy within 2 days. There is alcohol in this product, so it is not moisturizing enough to have longevity. I just don&#x27;t get all the hype. Back to Xen-Tan Dark Lotion for me. I always go back to this product, nothing else seems to compare in my opinion. ASIN:B001181W7K Xen-Tan Dark Lotion, 8-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 25 and starting to notice the damange of tanning beds. Started back up again in March laying in the beds, to get all base tanned for summer. Haven&#x27;t laid in one in weeks since I bought Fake Bake Flawless. Oh em gee. It literally DOES NOT get any better than this product. I am a self tanner junkie and have tried any decent product I can get my hands on. Self tanner has to be 50/50, that is half formulation and half application technique. This is the very best of both worlds and I never have any streaks or orange color EVER EVER EVER. My mom who typically lectures me about tanning beds was yelling at me last weekend until I told her I haven&#x27;t been in one and what I had on was \\&quot;tan in a can\\&quot;, now I got her started in this product. Buy it. BUY IIIIIT. Save your skin and buy this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Had a very strong bronzer, I looked orange for hours after application, but was willing to deal with it. The smell was not even that bad. What was horrible was 12 hours after applying I showered, as normal, no exfoliation. When I dried and got dressed, no color was left over on my skin, not even a hint of color. I was upset and had put hope into this product. Did not return or ask for a refund because as a sunless tanner trying new products this is the risk you take, I do not believe in returning just because it did not work for me, I used the product about 5 times and threw away.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it looks so natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply!</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Awesome! Best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Does have a nice brown color but must be from a foundation type base. Stained everything light my skin came into contact with after it was completely dry. Stained clothes, sheets, and even the white toilet seat. And the stains won&#x27;t come out of any of these things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a porcelain skinned redhead and this product didn&#x27;t deliver much of a tan. I applied on day 1 and then day 3 to try to get a more baked look but the additional application didn&#x27;t produce more color. Noone at the office noticed my tan. This product might produce results for darker skinned gals. If you want to try it, the price with Amazon prime can&#x27;t be beat. It was also delivered ontime and in good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It streaked a bit. I found the best way to achieve a smoother result was to exfoliate several days prior and moisturize the morning before an evening application. Still doesn&#x27;t replace tanning salon sprays. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Great color very natural even after just 1 use, I will but again</li>
            <li> This is the BEST self-tanner. I hated self-tanners bc it always made you look spotty and orange, this Fake Bake Flawless is AMAZING!!!! I recommend this to everyone. I also bought one for my mom and she loves it as well. After so many years of searching we found the perfect one!!!!! So happy/excited!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of self tanners over the past 3 years. I don&#x27;t want to tan anymore but I want some color in the summer months. This is the best I have tried and I have tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very well. Even in those hard to color areas like knees, ankles, elbows and feet. I put this on at night before bed. It dries quickly. Be sure to use an exfoliating sugar or salt scrub before use. Then hop in the shower in the morning and rinse it off because it will rub off on your clothing (and sheets).  It looks very natural. I cant say enough about this tanner. After buying countless others, I will not use anything else but this.&lt;br /&gt;The mit and gloves it comes with is perfect. Make sure you apply it in circular motion however its very forgiving and the coverage is so smooth and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;It washes completely out of your sheets and clothes.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not on my short list of favorites either. I prefer Neutrogena micro-mist because it doesn&#x27;t have a messy guide color.  Pros: * Color came out fairly evenly. * Dries very fast and not sticky. * Good medium darkness after one application. * Mitt is interesting and can be helpful to apply evenly. * Gloves are essential, I like that they included a pair.  Neutrals: * If you like having a guide color this is a good one as it doesn&#x27;t transfer too much. I hate guide colors however. * While applying, the fragrance is nice but after about an hour it wears off and smells bad on the skin just like all other self-tanners, even after showering. They all have the same darkening agent I believe so they&#x27;re all going to smell bad on the skin even after showering until the color has faded away. It&#x27;s a musty scent that smells a bit worse than sweat (but not B.O.). I&#x27;d recommend using a warm perfume like coconut, magnolia, or vanilla to help cover it.  Cons: * Can&#x27;t spray directly to the body (as it will color your floors) so applying takes longer because it must be rubbed in. Neutrogena Micro-mist can easily be sprayed to the middle of my back without rubbing or staining floors. * As I said earlier, I hate guide colors. If you get a splash of water it&#x27;ll run onto your clothes or furniture. When you spray it from the bottle it will make a mess even if you&#x27;re spraying directly to the mitt. Also, it sticks to dry or damaged skin, including the hair follicles where I shaved before applying - this made me look like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs and bikini area until I rinse the guide off. * I&#x27;m olive toned and this color came out slightly too orange for my liking. If you&#x27;re pinker toned, I think this will look even more orange. * Self-tanners usually dry my skin but also help clear my face, this one gave me some clogged pores/breakouts - I don&#x27;t recommend on the face.  Recommendations: * Shower your body (not hair, don&#x27;t want water dripping) using exfoliating showergloves and scrub your dry parts hard. Shave your legs, etc. * Turn on your AC or make sure the room is cool enough that you don&#x27;t sweat - I don&#x27;t recommend pointing a fan directly at yourself or it may dry too quickly. Stand on a DRY floor or towel as tanner may mix with water on the floor and stain your soles. * Use a heavy moisturizer (Nivea cream, CeraVe cream, or Cetaphil Cream) on your bum and lady bits (trust me, don&#x27;t skip your bum crack), knees, entire foot/ankle, elbows, wrists, hands, and face (especially eyes, lips, and upper lip). * Put gloves on both hands then put on mitt. * Spray directly on mitt IN THE SINK so you don&#x27;t get it on your floors. * Start with legs: at your feet then work your way up each leg (I sprayed the mitt about 20x per calf and 60x per thigh+bum cheek). * Continue to back: if you can&#x27;t reach well, spray the mitt and remove from your hand. With your right hand hold at the corner and reach over your back then with your left hand reach under your back and grab the other corner then drag it back and forth behind you to wipe the color in. Or, if you have a one of those back washing brushes, you can try slipping the mitt over it. * Continue to chest and belly. * Continue to arms: when you do your back and chest it&#x27;ll get on your arms so do arms last so that you can even them out. Avoid wrists. * Continue to face: Take off the mitt, spray 1 or 2x directly to gloved palms, rub hands together and apply to face and ears. It&#x27;s ok to apply to lips and eyelids just make sure they are heavily moisturized. * Take off your gloves and rinse your hands and wrists (in case any tanner leaked in). * Apply heavy moisturizer to your hands and wrists. * Gently pat the mitt on the back of hands and wrists then rub back of hands together. * Put some heavy moisturizer or petroleum jelly on a cotton pad and wipe on edges of feet, between toes and fingers, and wrists (to blend color where it will usually get over saturated). * Avoid showering for six hours andrinse the mitt.  PRO TIP: wear full coverage cotton panties and give your self a wedgie immediately after applying the tanner and for a couple hours so that the color won&#x27;t run even from minor sweating and concentrate on your bum crack edges. You don&#x27;t want a football shaped outline on your cheeks when you bend over :)  Same for large breasts, use a cotton bra that fits all the way in under the breast to absorb any sweating.           Exhibit A:  Incorrect tan lines: (__(*)__)  Correct: (__*__)           Exhibit Breast: Incorrect tan lines:  ((  o  )(  o  ))   Correct: (  o  )(  o  )</li>
            <li> First time I bought this i loved it, but then i purchased again and it seems like a totally different product.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not really impressed. I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about. Nice color if it would only last more than a day. It stinks a little less than other brands but still stinks. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way around the smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I am a super novice self tanner and I get so many complements on my tan. I am outside kind of a lot and so I have a good base tan but this stuff evens out my skin tone and helps blend tan lines...it&#x27;s so great. It goes on super quick, dries fast and is not sticky at all. Contrary to what other reviewers have said this stuff totally DOES have the self tanner smell after a couple hours but it&#x27;s not as bad as some brands. I have not experienced any permanent staining of fabrics in fact I wipe up the sink and bathroom countertops with a white towel afterwards and toss it in the wash....comes out no problem. I will say that if you are going to be sweating heavily the next day after using this product you will want to shower...with soap...to get all the color guard off otherwise you will sweat the tanner off onto you clothing...not cute..trust me. I followed the advice of one reviewer and got the Xen Tan Blending Balm and after I swipe on this tanner I rub the blending balm around the edges of my feet, my knees, my elbows, my inner elbows, the webs of my hands,my knuckles and the edges of my hands and wrists. Because of this I have not noted any weird hyper dark discolorations. I took off one star because I just wish the color lasted longer....it lasts about 2-3 days and is pretty faded by the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  I usually do 2 thin layers, and it covers evenly and perfectly!  Gives my skin just enough color so I&#x27;m not pale, but doesn&#x27;t make me look dark/fake either.  Smells nice too.  I would notice some color come off in the bottom of the shower, even the next day, so I avoided using it in high humidity or if there was a chance I would get wet or be out in the rain....I didn&#x27;t want to end up with streaks.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles of Fake bake and love this product! It goes on smoothly and smells good too. It is the only self tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange as I am very fair. Great product and price!!</li>
            <li> Legit. It&#x27;s the real deal and arrived quickly. covers evenly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; product I have used. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> description was accurate arrived promptly through amazon shipping</li>
            <li> I bought the small 6-ounce size of Fake Bake to test it out.  Having used other topical tanning agents I can say the best use of this product is for the BODY.  Yes just the body; legs, buttocks, back, stomach and possibly the arms.  It goes on dark, evenly, dries quickly and looks natural.  These are the reasons I indicate the body as the best use of this product. I am fair skinned and have not noticed any orange tones.  For the face, chest and arms I recommend &#x27;Norvell Prime Bronze 4-FACES&#x27;.  It leaves a very nice tone on the face and chest.  Fake Bake left streaks on my chest so as I&#x27;ve said above - use a bronzer specifically for the face.</li>
            <li> so i am as fair skinned as it gets,  first try gave me a believable golden tan.  no streaking, not alot of mess, no smell.  put this stuff on waited 5 minutes to dry and threw on pj&#x27;s.  washed off color guide in the morning.  looks great!  i will be using this all summer i think!</li>
            <li> Pretty great tan! I have fair skin and it is so difficult for me to get a tan. I tried the tanning beds but it would take me 10 sessions just to get a slight color. This gives you a very natural tan and it keeps me out of those tanning beds. You can build up your tan to how dark you want to be. It is not sticky at all and the smell is amazing. I would use it in the morning and walk out of the house and people loved the smell. It dries in a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t stain anything. I used this tanner 5 times in a row to get a darker tan and I didn&#x27;t look orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing thing about this is that it made a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else experienced this but it made my skin so soft. I sprayed my face with this and it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or breakouts. Buy this instead of hurting your skin from tanning! For less than $13 it cost way less than tanning at a salon.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better tanners I&#x27;ve ran into.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me orange and they provide a mitt which is great and helps prevent a streaking effect that can happen without a mitt or sponge.  The amount of product is descent as well.  I got between 8-10 full body uses.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product was how light it was.  For a comparison, I changed my makeup 2 shades darker than I would usually wear (I&#x27;m fair skinned).  I was hopping for something slightly more drastic.  It also appears that you might be able to layer this product on after the previous layer has dried but I didn&#x27;t personally try this all over, I just happened to notice on a few spots that happened to overlap.  I definitely like the brand though and will be repurchasing the product, just in the darker version.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have found, and I have tried dozens. The instant color it gives is natural enough to go out in during the day, and the color that stays after you shower is really natural as well. This also has the most pleasant smell. Yes, it still has an odor, but it is more tropical than the tell tale sunless tanner smell most give off. Also, my skin is so fair it is pretty much see through, and it makes me look like I have spent time in the sun. I really like the mitt that comes with it as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this tanner. It really provides a flawless tan and smells good too. This is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this product already, I have been using it for a little over a week now, almost everyday, my problem with it is that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to stay very long. I have to apply it every day or every other day for my skin to keep the tan. It is great for an instant tan and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross fake tan smell. All in all, I will keep using it, until I can get some real sun.</li>
            <li> Finally! An at-home product that does not smell, lasts well, and doesn&#x27;t look orange, dirty, smudgy, streaky, etc. No self-tanning nightmares, and it costs less than half a spray tan! (Half a spray tan would be ridiculous, anyhow). I have told my sister and tons of friends to buy this already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tanned my whole body four times, and the bottle is still fairly full (1/2?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY problem, was that the mitt got hard/streaky after a few uses (looked like I was applying a faux Mahogany wood finish onto my thighs!!!). However, I washed it in warm water and used a teasing brush to fluff it back up (eyelash or bristle brush would have the same effect). Works perfectly again!</li>
            <li> Really great product!!! Smells very yummy and looks wonderful and healthy on the skin. I have found products just as good or better though, for a cheaper price. Still a great product</li>
            <li> Easy and looks nice and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well this works!!  I&#x27;m pale-skinned, Caucasian &amp; burn like crazy.  I had previously been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion/Deep Dark Color &amp; it was OK but the smell on my skin after awhile was terrible &amp; it would turn orangey-yellowy-brown on my skin but it still looked semi-normal &amp; gave my pasty white skin a little bit of color, so I kept using it.  THIS product is amazing--it doesn&#x27;t smell bad even after a couple of hours or the next morning when I wake up, it doesn&#x27;t get on my sheets at night, it turns my skin an immediate actual believable golden tan color &amp; then after I shower the next day the color is lighter but still present.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights so far &amp; it&#x27;s building color gradually &amp; totally believably.  I love the buffing mitt idea, I don&#x27;t need to use the rubber gloves that come with it &amp; I may be spraying too lightly each time onto the mitt but it works really well for me &amp; goes on sheer &amp; the more I buff, the more it goes on evenly &amp; beautifully.  It is hard for me to buff the middle of my back, but that&#x27;s just me &amp; my arms &amp; my anatomy.  This is the most realistic, easiest to use, best-smelling fake tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  This is absolutely going to be a staple in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great color, easy application, really lasts. Caution for older women, makes your age spots more apparent.</li>
            <li> Great tan!!!!!!  Great service! !!!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner!  I am a pasty white redhead, and this gives me wonderfully even, brown color. Nobody suspects it is out of a bottle until I tell them.  It is important to keep skin regularly moisturized while using this though.</li>
            <li> Easy application, nice color (not orangey at all) and dries quickly.  My only complaint is it takes quite a few applications to get a decent sun kissed looked and doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d hope.  But it&#x27;s natural looking and doesn&#x27;t smell bad so it&#x27;s worth the extra work - and it isn&#x27;t that much work anyway.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as the directions would suggest .</li>
            <li> Product works as described, unless you have dry legs! Easy to use as well!</li>
            <li> Love the spray tan product Fake Bake Flawless. I love that it comes with the mitt so you are able to apply the product evenly. The color is perfect! Not orange. I also love that it dries so quickly, so none of the product gets on clothes or on your sheets.</li>
            <li> I am half black and half white. I refuse to damage and ruin the youthful lipids from UV rays, but I really like a \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; glow form a tan. So I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanner for seven years. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Micro Mist (a good cheapie), L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (a glittery and splotchy mess) and countless others... Fake Bake IS THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do spray directly on my skin, and I have not have an \\&quot;orange\\&quot; issue. However, mileage may varies due to natural complexion.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used. There is not a hint of orange to the color, and gives you a buildable, dark tan if that&#x27;s the look you desire. I have received so many compliments on my tan, and some have even asked if I recently returned from vacation. It fades nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave you blotchy like many self tanners do. I will be a customer for as long as this product is available... truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried many, many self tanners over the years, and Fake Bake is by far the best. I have fair freckle skin, it tans but does not look orange or streaky. It goes on dry, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s not too dark and blends well with the mitt.</li>
            <li> This worked soo well for me and I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned person! It lasts for a while too!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Gives me a nice, natural golden tan color (I&#x27;m medium complexion) and the scent is not offensive at all....actually quite pleasant and not expected!  I used to use St. Tropez...but I found the color is not as golden on me...more of a brownish shade, the scent is a bit offensive, and the cost is so much more.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d switch, but Fake Bake beat out St. Tropez for me right now!</li>
            <li> When reviewing a self-tan product, I believe it&#x27;s extremely important to introduce certain characteristics of the author in order for readers to determine whether the product should apply to them. Before I begin, I am 21 years old and extremely fair. As a child, I was decidedly ginger/strawberry blonde, so my skin WILL NOT tan - not then, not now. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunless tanners throughout my middle school/high school/collegiate struggle to be tan (or at least a normal, non-ghost shade). This ranges from L&#x27;Oreals Sublime Bronze lotions/sprays, to Model Co. products, to Xen Tan, and lots of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, this Fake Bake Flawless is my favorite self-tan product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;d argue that, when used properly, this is the best sunless tanner. The color guard in combination with the mitt makes sure I get every single square inch of my body, no streaks. It dried in minutes, and I was able to dress quickly. The liquid develops into a wonderful brown (not orange!) color, and it was even and believable. HOWEVER... it must be used properly :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviews on here that have complaints about this product that I&#x27;m going to address here (mostly noting why they&#x27;re silly complaints). The first major complaint is \\&quot;bottle leakage\\&quot; - the spray bottle that comes with the product is too long for the bottle. The natural solution I came up with was cutting down the straw to make it short enough to fit in the bottle and prevent leaks. CUT THE STRAW before you use and your Fake Bake won&#x27;t leak! The second major complaint is about the application mitt. Some people say it leaves fuzzy stuff on them, some people say it should have velour on both sides, and some people think it won&#x27;t last until the tanning product runs out. All of these are wrong. If you&#x27;ve shaved and don&#x27;t press too hard, your mitt should NOT be leaving fuzzes on you. You&#x27;re supposed to lightly buff the product on. If the mitt had velour on both sides, there would be risk for rubbing extra tanning solution in random places, most notably on your body where it can leave a streak. One of my biggest tips in using this product is WASH the mitt of all leftover tanning solution after each use. This will keep it in MUCH better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the brown, amazing results that most reviewers gush about for this product... it&#x27;s not hard. Here are some steps to follow.&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Shave and exfoliate with a Baiden mitten or a similar Turkish bath mitt. If you don&#x27;t know what it is, promptly go purchase it and use it and be amazed. UPDATE 4/28/2014: Dry brushing thoroughly prior to entering the shower is also adequate exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Take some scissors and snip off a bit more than an inch of the spray bottle attachment that came with the product, and put the modified attachment onto the bottle. This WILL prevent all leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Rub body cream (I use Bliss Lemon &amp; Sage body butter, the BEST cream EVER) into your elbows, knees, ankles, and knuckles. Let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Apply sunless solution as per the directions, using the gloves and the mitt, spraying on the mitt and then LIGHTLY buffing the color all over (it&#x27;s probably best to put a tiny dab of body lotion on your knees and elbows and ankles).&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: This is my personal step that really helps me as an extremely pale person get a beautiful, even, brown tan. Everyone hates the tell-tale splotching on hands/feet that give away the fact that you&#x27;re wearing a store bought tan.  I highly recommend that every pale someone purchase a product called Xen Tan Blending Balm. Once you&#x27;re done applying the tanner all over, including hands and feet, take your blending balm and go over your elbows, ankles, knuckles, sides of feet/hands, and wrists. I usually don&#x27;t need Blending Balm on my knees when I use body butter. This will prevent the tan from developing into too-dark territory. UPDATE 7/25/2014: Xen Tan Blending Balm is almost impossible to find these days, but its first ingredient is petrolatum. Use some Vaseline instead if you can&#x27;t find the Blending Balm. I also recommend using Smith&#x27;s rosebud salve or any Badger balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL... The Fake Bake Flawless system is fantastic. It&#x27;s well-priced and delivers beautiful results (even for gingers), and beats the inconvenience associated with going to the spray tan place. When the correct measures are taken, it looks great for a long time. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep, dark tropical tan, you&#x27;ll need to apply it a few nights in a row. My advice is BUY THIS NOW. And then order some Xen Tan Blending Balm and a Baiden mitten (both very important!) OR as per update 7/25/2014 you can also use a dry brush pre-shower instead of a bath mitt and Vaseline/Smith&#x27;s rosebud salve/Badger balm instead of blending balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: September 27, 2012&lt;br /&gt;After finishing a whole bottle of Fake Bake, I&#x27;m happy to report that the velour mitten is still in tact. I&#x27;m adding this edit to emphasize how important it is to wash your mitten between uses. Washing the mitten also prevents leftover solution from becoming reactivated and leaving darker splotches in random places during application. Seriously yall, WASH YOUR MITTEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 13, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Something I never mentioned in this review which I should have... The color guard is GREAT. It&#x27;s gorgeous and brown. But... It will streak when it rains, and wash off in the shower, and rub off on your sheets. Which, to me, is whatever. It&#x27;s fine. But it&#x27;s just good to know and plan around! For instance... I opted to use Jergens the night before Carolina Cup a couple years back because I knew it would be rainy and I didn&#x27;t want everyone and their momma noting how streaky my tan seemed to get in the drizzle. Anyways, just wanted to give this little update. Happy tanning :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 28, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Years later, I&#x27;m still obsessed with this tanning product :) However, like many people in the comments note, the product doesn&#x27;t last as long as other sunless tanners without maintenence. Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 25, 2014&lt;br /&gt;A whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  I always use them when I tan. I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking. My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  Both always applied with gloves and mitt, after exfoliation, with the Xen Tan blending balm. Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade. If you&#x27;ve never had success with a self tan product, buy the Fake Bake Flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  For those of you who want a longer lasting tan, with a more difficult application, I recommend Tanwise Lotion or Mousse.  The lotion stays on FOREVER. Tanwise is not a product for the faint of heart - it goes on VERY dark and stains your skin in streaks unless you blend QUICKLY. The other issue with the Tanwise is the bronzers WILL stain your hands, and the only way to get it off is with baking soda. I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later. You can find Tanwise products here on Amazon or at a Sally Beauty supply near you - but remember, they are NOT easy to apply correctly. The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  I like to apply the Tanwise mousse with the gloves and mitt from my Fake Bake kit and it always works perfectly.doesn&#x27;t last as long as other sunless tanners without maintenence. Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this is a wonderful option when you need a light tan the day before a big event, such as a wedding or a horse race or a tailgate, and you don&#x27;t have much time to devote to getting it perfect and you don&#x27;t want to smell like you&#x27;ve been tanning.  Fake Bake Flawless is also an ideal option for people who have never applied their own sunless tanner before, as it is basically idiot-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 25, 2014&lt;br /&gt;A whole 3 years later, after 2 Fake Bake Flawless kits, I still have both velour mitts.  I always use them when I tan. I don&#x27;t always use the Flawless system anymore, as it doesn&#x27;t develop dark enough to my liking. My top two tanning products are Tanwise mousse via Sally Beauty and St. Moriz self tanning spray in dark, which you can find at Ulta.  Both always applied with gloves and mitt, after exfoliation, with the Xen Tan blending balm. Keep in mind that these are MY favorites, but I&#x27;ve been self tanning for more than a decade. If you&#x27;ve never had success with a self tan product, buy the Fake Bake Flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of so many comments about how this product doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m going to recommend another option that I really love.  For those of you who want a longer lasting tan, with a more difficult application, I recommend Tanwise Lotion or Mousse.  The lotion stays on FOREVER. Tanwise is not a product for the faint of heart - it goes on VERY dark and stains your skin in streaks unless you blend QUICKLY. The other issue with the Tanwise is the bronzers WILL stain your hands, and the only way to get it off is with baking soda. I went to Charleston recently and applied this the morning of a very long day of bar crawling, and my arms were still tan at work a whole week later. You can find Tanwise products here on Amazon or at a Sally Beauty supply near you - but remember, they are NOT easy to apply correctly. The Fake Bake Flawless is still my absolute favorite product for a quick, easy, pretty, coconut-scented tan.  I like to apply the Tanwise mousse with the gloves and mitt from my Fake Bake kit and it always works perfectly.</li>
            <li> After using banana boat self tanner all last year and not knowing that there was a self tanner out there for less then 30 bucks that wouldnt turn you that fake orangey color i continued to use it all throughout the year even though i knew how gross it looked but i have a weird issue with being tan so i just couldnt stop because i didnt want to look pale. SO this summer i searched and searched for a product that was easy to use and turned me a NATURAL TAN with no streaks....and i came across this stuff on youtube and i LOVE it. At first i was looking for a lotion because sprays sounded so messy and hard to apply, [but not this stuff it is fool proof with the mit.] So i was at first gonna try sun labs but then right before i ordered it online i saw a review of this on youtube and a demonstration. The girl made it look sooooo easy and the color she turned was a gorgeous tan!! ANd not only that it also is way cheaper. I am already quite tan and turn very very tan in the summer, so i got this for the winter times when im not as tan as usual. So we&#x27;ll see how it works on paler skin because with banana boat i had boughten it last summer and it looked great over an already tan body but on pale skin it turns orangey especially in natural lighting so i really hope fake bake doesnt do that. The girl that demonstrated it on youtube was quite pale and she turned a gorgeous tan so im not too worried about it. Also a lot of people said that you need to shower the morning after applying because of the color guard, well i dont shower after and it works great and doesnt rub off so i dont think its necessary to shower after, all showering does is wipe away the tan. I only use this product on my face and neck right now because i dont want to wear foundation and i want my face as tan as my body without having to color in my whole face and neck with makeup and look all cakey. it works really well and looks like my natural tan and if you use the mit thoroughly it wont streak!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner out there.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy after application, and smells pretty good.  Color is natural looking, not orangey or fake.  I did notice after the first use that the bottle does tend to leak some from the cap, so when I packed it for a trip by air, I sealed it in 2 ziploc bags.  Thankfully I had, as almost the entire bottle had leaked out.  Sadly I ended up washing it down the drain. I will definitely buy Fake Bake again, other than the bottle leaking, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously its goof proof! Where has this been when I was in my teens and thought tanning beds were awesome. If your undecided about buying this DONT BE! OREDER IT!!  Its easy to apply,no mess, no streaking and the color is beautiful! Thank you Fake Bake! Money well spent!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have ever used ! There are no streaks, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it starts tanning instantly! I am going to stay faithful to this product!</li>
            <li> I have used every sunless tanning product out there and this is the absolute best! Just the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning cream is huge! I can actually put it on my hands and feet without it looking like crap.  No transfer on my sheets either.....and they are white.  I do it at night after my shower.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have gotten my Mom to get this, who is even more pale than I am and she LOVES it and swears by it. She gets a very natural color as well.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Let me just start off by saying that I am Polish, Finnish, and Irish. We are a pale, stout people meant to live in cold, dark places. Thusly, no matter what I do I cannot get a tan; I burn, or turn a sort of odd orangish color. It&#x27;s really quite terrible. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test drive this product this summer, before I go to Hawaii in the winter, to give myself time to find a good fake tan. I have found it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by using it on my legs only, just in case it went badly. I followed directions and exfoliated quite well, shaved etc. I just used a rough washcloth and rubbed the heck out of my legs, knees and feet until I was smooth and clean. After making sure my skin was completely dry, I rubbed a small dab on Vitamin E Oil on my knee area and rubbed it in well, just to make sure they weren&#x27;t too dry. Then, I applied the product. I followed the directions of going lightly over knees and ankles, making sure they were extended so it wasn&#x27;t wrinkley, etc. The rest of it is pretty much self explanatory. The mitt worked well for me and was a nice touch. Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure this bottle will last me a LONG time. At least a few months of solid use, but perhaps even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells nice in the bottle. Sort of floral/tropical.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has NO fake tan smell on your skin. I was expecting it and was ok with it if I tanned well, but I am both tan and NOT  SMELLY!&lt;br /&gt;3. The color guide really does help you see where it went, and also looks passable as a tan until your tan develops.&lt;br /&gt;4. It dries quickly after you apply it so you don&#x27;t have to stand around nekkid forever.&lt;br /&gt;5. My tan looks nice. I went to bed, woke up and rinsed off my legs in the shower and that was it. So easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The spray part of my bottle was a little drippy so Ihad to keep wiping up little drips from my floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, that was it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. I will be buying more soon to stock up!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much anything out there. This stuff applies easily, does not over power me with \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; smell and dries almost instantly. The price is great too. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, one of the best (if not THE best) sunless tanners I have ever tried. The only thing that could possibly come close on the believability scale is Christian Dior. Fortunately, this is half the cost and with the added advantage of seeing color immediately. I will admit though that I was intimidated by some of the other reviews &amp; the product information concerning the prep &amp; how dark it might be. I wanted believable color but not to go from fair to Snooki in one day. I almost returned it before I tried it. So glad I didn&#x27;t! Yes there&#x27;s a bit more prep than you would have with the average drugstore product but nothing over the top. I was pleased to see this go on so sheer &amp; light while quickly drying. Most unbelievably of all? Absolutely no telltale tanner smell. You know the one. Usually even if you don&#x27;t smell it that night, you will by morning. This had none of that. There also wasn&#x27;t that drastic of a difference between the guide &amp; what your final color is. The next morning, I was believably bronzed with nary a hint of chemical odor to give me away. The only small downside to this particular product would be reaching your back by yourself. Still not enough to deter me from being a fan. This is one of those products that I will add to my long term routine for sure.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I tried it right away. I have used the original Fake Bake lotion and was satisfied with the results, just not the gawd awful smell.  This stuff is divine! It doesn&#x27;t stink &amp; takes half the time to apply as any other self tanning product.  I saw results after the first use, but used continuously for about 4 days and then every couple days I would reapply.  As long as you exfoliate once a week and reapply to get the desired skin tone, you will never have any problems with streaks or splotches.  It lasted me about a month of use and took about a week to 10 days to completely fade after I ran out.  I cannot wait to purchase more and I will never purchase any other product ever again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skinned redhead and I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunless tanning products including professional airbrush tans and automated spray tan booths. They all turned me an embarassing orange color. Fakebake flawless is the best I&#x27;ve used so far...by far!</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning a couple of years ago for the sake of my future skin. But, I could no longer take being so very pale. After reading many positive reviews on Amazon and watching many positive reviews on YouTube, I decided to give Fake Bake Flawless a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. No streaking, no spotting, and no orange color. It blends wonderfully, it wears well, and the color builds with daily applications. Also, six ounces didn&#x27;t seem like it would last long. But, I have barely made a dent in that six ounces. Love that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pale skin now has that beachy, beautiful, golden brown color that I absolutely love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the grocery and a woman I know asked me if I had been on vacation because of my tan. That says a lot about the product. She was so surprised the tan was from a self-tanner. The gloves and the mitt really make a difference in the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake Flawless is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair, to the point where even the lightest shade of foundation in most makeup is too dark for me. I tried Fake Bake after trying numerous self tanners for years! They never did their job as good as this product. I highly recommend it. It drys in seconds. I use a thin layer of oil on my skin before I spay on the tanner, which helps me from any splotches which would be very visible on me. I love this product. It&#x27;s a super fast application and for once I feel it looks totally naturally and I actually have a real tan. My husband says it&#x27;s perfect and he&#x27;s seen me go through MANY self tanners!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used other tanning products and none has been as easy to use as this one.  The included plastic gloves and soft mitt makes application a breeze.  I usually use this in the tub or shower and spray the mitt 8-10 times per application.  It takes 2-3 applications per body part (ie: right leg, left leg, chest, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews complaining that the color washes off.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue, but I apply it as recommended in the instructions - after exfoliation and before bed.  I can apply color to my entire body in 5-10 minutes.  I wait a minute for it to dry before dressing for bed.  I&#x27;ve never had my clothing or my sheets discolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I dislike the coconut scent.  Why is it all suntan lotion manufacturers think we want to smell like a coconut?  Unscented would be just fine with me.  So other than the scent, this is a great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product really shows your pores :/  but other than that i like it.  No streaking,  not orange,  grear color!</li>
            <li> It works to an extend. It is easy to apply. Make sure you apply it a few hours before bed so it doesn&#x27;t stain your sheets. When you wake up, you have to take a shower, otherwise, the tan won&#x27;t look natural, more of an orange color. Besides that, it works and looks pretty good for about 3-4 weeks. The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Applied the product per instructions. The color tint looked awesome after applying. Slept overnight in it. It stained my shirt and sheets. Would not wash out like most. Showered when I woke up and all the color went down the drain. I was no darker than before. I applied it a second day in a row, used double the product I did before and got a tiny hint of color the next day. I applied a third day in a row and never got any darker. I used almost the entire bottle in 4 days and got 1 shade darker. I have a light olive complexion but I am lighter due to stayimg out of the sun. I&#x27;ve never had a good experience with Fake Bake products but this was the worst. I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanners religiously for over 10 years. I would suggest L&#x27;Oréal sublime bronze for a drugstore brand or Victorias Secret tanning gel if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely what it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;fake bake&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all..and the tan doesn&#x27;t last if you get a tiny drop of water on you, you can definitely tell.. I was so excited when I first got it because all the reviews but I think the gradually tanning lotions work better then this!</li>
            <li> Great non-orange color. The mitt ensures a no-streak application. However, it only lasts as long as you don&#x27;t shower...</li>
            <li> I used to use a tanning bed, and while I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore, I couldn&#x27;t give u my glow. The price of this stuff is amazing for the tan you get. I put it on every other day for a week, and then once a week after that for the rest of the summer (unless it looks like I need touch-ups). The color looks so real, doesn&#x27;t rub off on ANYTHING, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like it! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now and it hasn&#x27;t disappoint me. Looks real natural when it develops and it also gives you some color as you put it on.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and the price was right. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but my legs just never seem to get as tan as my arms do so this has been a great way to get that perfect match! Color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;Billie Grable&lt;br /&gt;Author, The Weeping Willow Sings</li>
            <li> Love this product, looks like the real thing. The mitt is great for applying evenly. People are always saying &amp;#34; wow do you have a great tan&amp;#34;....they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s not real and it&#x27;s so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li> First off love this product works really good im fair skinned and it made me a beautiful taned color also loved how fast it got shipped i was surprised abd verry satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Didn&#x27;t stain any of my clothes and was easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend having a friend help for all over even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The color isn&#x27;t too orange and came off very natural!</li>
            <li> oh the smell. i cant handle it.  i just put some on my arms to test it out over night.  its been about 20 min and i cant take it anymore.  its not that its a horrible smell but the the perfume smell is so strong im getting nauseous.  they need to tone down that smell.  it smells like day old self tanner and too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of self tanning products over the years, and this one is my favorite. I&#x27;m one of the unlucky few with body chemistry that exacerbates the scent of every single self tanner I&#x27;ve tried EXCEPT for this one. With other products, the smell was so strong that it lingered even after showering- not in a powerful way but it was enough to make me reluctant to use it if I were going out and about anytime in the next 12 hours. With Fake Bake, I can apply it before going out and never notice the smell. As an added bonus, it goes on dark, so you can actually see where it has been applied AND it gives you an instant tan, which I find preferable to products that are initially clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve developed a quick, simple application method for those of you who are interested. After showering/exfoliating, but before drying off, I spray a little Avon skin so soft oil on my skin and rub it in like you would with moisturizer. Then I dry off with a towel, and apply Fake Bake with the handy dandy included mitten. The skin so soft helps with even application and absorption. It&#x27;s especially great for my feet and knees. I suspect this method reduces the amount of product absorbed into my skin, which in turn shortens the life of my fake tan, but it makes application so fast and easy that I don&#x27;t mind having to do it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another helpful hint: always wash the mitten thoroughly after each use, with soap, until you&#x27;ve rinsed out all of the fake bake. The mitten will last longer, and this is an easy way to also wash the product off your hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks like a real tan. It&#x27;s a real brown tint. None of that orangey stuff. It&#x27;s better than Tan Towels, Quick drench,Banana Boat,L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze,and Neutrogena Sunless tan products. And i&#x27;m not against any of those products either. This stuff is just superior. It&#x27;s going to be my new secret weapon. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ok lets just start off..Im litterally tanorexic!! I have tried every single one out there..before I applied this stuff I read the negative reviews and mostly said no color so I appied 3 coats amd let me tell you this stuff dries like theres nothing on ur skin its amazing!!! so I exfoliated first applied 3coats and washed it off in 5 hours and gave me a beautiful brown tan with a lil hint of orange but by far the best ever!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s the best/darkest self tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is, is that is starts to streak after 3 days at some places of my body (arms, feet).</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price, but fades way too quickly. It&#x27;d work best if you&#x27;re already tan, and use this just to maintain it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone trying to build a tan from zero.</li>
            <li> Did not apply evenly. Would collect in certain areAs. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner. Didn&#x27;t make me orange and had a pleasant smell. Recommended to my friends who want to self tan</li>
            <li> This product is worth EVERY penny! I&#x27;m a redhead/fair skinned, I burn super easy and never tan naturally. I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners, this is by far the best! it has a bit of a red tint, so It looks completely natural and streak free. I&#x27;m in love! I will use this product forever!</li>
            <li> Very messy to apply and stains everything, just go pay for a spray tan or two at your local tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I looove the way this smells!! Products like these are only as good as their users. You have to be very good about applying and rubbing it in so you don&#x27;t get any lines to streaks. I&#x27;ve stopped using this for a while because of laziness. You can not be lazy with this product. I love it. I just wish I wasn&#x27;t as lazy</li>
            <li> I have tried about 15 self tanners in the last 2 years or so and have not been impressed by any. I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I was surprised when I opened the bottle to see it so runny and was concerned. I am used to thick lotions or gels. I put in the spray nozzle and used the glove that was provided. It went on in a light thin layer not thick and sticky like all the others I have tried. Dried FAST and not streaky and gross!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; evenly. Easy to apply &amp; great color.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanning spray on the market if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Fake Bake original formula for years.  The original formula is messy and stinky but worked really well so I was afraid to try something new.  I wish I had tried the &amp;#34;Flawless&amp;#34; formula a long time ago!  It goes on more smoothly, no streaks, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells like a coconut sunscreen!  I will never go back to the original formula again!</li>
            <li> This product works and is easy to apply. The smell is fairly strong and I get tired of the smell.  It&#x27;s not an awful smell, just too strong.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have ever used, and believe me I have used MANY! This is very natural looking and quick to apply and dry. I would recommend exfoliating and using the skin smoothie for prep.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Took a little bit to apply the first time trying to make even, but overall amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tanner stuff I&#x27;ve bought/tried/. Looked really good and the tone was a nice golden bronzey tan not orange. It also didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin so two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a connoisseur of fake tanning products, and this is definitely a good one, particularly for the price. It goes on easily (BUT USE THE GLOVES!!) and you don&#x27;t need a ton to see a difference. I&#x27;ve only used it about 2x a week for a solid base. I received several compliments on my tan the first week I used it, and someone even asked if I had gone to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Super easy to put on and looks great! I used this for my winter wedding when I&#x27;m usually pasty white. I had a beautiful &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; for my pictures and honeymoon.</li>
            <li> works well, color is fantastic. I like the mit, and it applies the best self tanner to your hands.</li>
            <li> Get brown without skin cancer! Easy to apply. It comes with a mitt to apply. I now spray on my skin and quickly rub in. So much cheaper than other products! It can rub off on clothes until your first shower, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, but several hours after application it smelled awful.  Maybe it was just the chemical reaction with my particular skin type, but I found it intolerable.  I believe I do better with a creamier consistency, as it is easier to handle.  On the plus side, the color was perfect.</li>
            <li> I might try the darker one soon, but this is pretty great. It helps even out the color disparity between my arms and legs that comes from my usual outfit of jeans and tank tops.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick fake tan.  My new favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li> Drys quick. No lines but doesn&#x27;t cover as well by itself. I use it along with my other tanner for quick touch ups or if you just want a light coverage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome not orange!!! Smells pretty good not a heavy odor at all. Just try it once and you will never try anything else!</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t give me much of a tan, and what it did give me would fade in about four days. Was surprised to see the sally hansen  &amp;#34;leg makeup&amp;#34; gave me a darker tan, covered flaws, and was way easier to use versus the fake bake. Maybe try the darker version of the fake bake. I wanted to like this, guess it&#x27;s ok if you spray a lot on.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products on the market and this one was by far the best.  Myself and 2 other bridesmaid risked it big time and tried this the night before a wedding and it came out perfect.  It&#x27;s a faint enough color the next day.  You can do multiple applications every night to achieve a darker color but we wanted a subtle color for pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt is awesome.. I think that&#x27;s the key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> this product is okay. i would not recomend using it on your hands or the bottoms of your arms. it becomes blotchy and streeky. but other then thta works good on legs tummy topside arms and even works on face</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time. I wanted to tan up a little before heading out on a beach vacation but the product just comes off in the water and leaves streaks on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It goes on evenly if you do it right and last for a decent amount of time. Definitely did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I wish it was a little darker, but this color guard is beautiful and great for adding quick color. Once it washes off it doesnt leave as much tan as I would like, I use this after a spray tan to prolong my tan!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from a previous review, and this product works great. I rinse my mitt after each use. I also cut the tube that is inserted into the bottle before first use, and have had no leakage as others have reported.The smell is much better then other tanners. I have had no streaks or dark spots while using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It gives me just enough color to look like I laid out in the sun but doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, however you will start to get a little orangey brown looking if you keep re-applying too much. My recommendation, do it two days in a row and then start doing it every other day just to keep up the color, unless you don&#x27;t shower every day then just do it on the days you shower after exfoliating.  I love the mitt because it makes everything go on even.</li>
            <li> I am the self tanner queen! I never have time to go tanning and when I saw this product on youtube.com I just had to try it! It does not come out orange, the smell is great (because you know that self tanners can have a weird after smell), and it is so easy to apply! If you are unsure just youtube it like how I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance! I LOVE this product and will be an lifetime user!! A must buy!</li>
            <li> Best best best self tanner ever. I have used them all, no joke, I love trying new self tanners and gradual tanners. I was watching some reviews online and this girl named Steph,@ SMLx0 on youtube did a great review and demo of this product. So, I ordered it and I was definately not disappointed. If you are careful and follow the instructions it is very easy and just like it says, FLAWLESS! 1.) Just put on the cute, purple, rubber gloves, 2.) slide on the mitt that is included, 3.) give the mitt a few sprays, 4.) then in circular motions rub it right on. The color guard makes this so easy and it looks very natural. PLUS, this literally drys right away, and you can put your clothes on as soon as you are done.(if it does get on clothes or towels it will easily come off in the wash so dont panic, I actually always get it on my towels because I stand on one while applying this and it always comes out in the wash) The smell if the best I have ever experienced. Smells more like a lotion used for getting in the tanner bed, rather then those smelly gradual tanners like Jergens e[...] Be careful if you do this in the morning fresh out of the shower, because wearing the color guard all day can get messed up when doing things like dishes, hanging wet laundry, or if you end up getting rained on lol. Other then that if you can avoid getting it wet then there is no reason not to wear the color guard all day. HOWEVER, if you do not like wearing a self tanner with a dark color guard you can definately apply this after a good exfoliating shower at night, and then rinse if off in the morning for a fresh tanned glow. So basically you can not go wrong with this. It is good for anyone, of any color as far as I am can tell. DEFINATELY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! &#x3D;] To see exactly how to use this, go to youtube, type in SMLx0 and find her Fake Bake Flawless review! Hope this helps, enjoy your sexy tan everyone!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time! I think the color is very even and natural looking. Doesn&#x27;t build up around my ankles, knees and elbows like the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It will transfer onto your clothing a little, especially if you sweat during exercise. It&#x27;s always washed out except for one workout top that I had to throw away. It will really transfers onto sheets, but has always washed out.</li>
            <li> I finally got to use this since ordering it. I loved how easy it was to apply and there is no smell or runny-ness. You do just as instructed and you have a nice golden tan. I will be ordering more!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this product. I read almost every review and discovered that all the negative reviews said &amp;#34;I have fair skin.&amp;#34; Well I don&#x27;t have fair skin. I consider my skin a meduim tone that gets a little on the pale side in the winter. This product works wonders if applied correctly by following the instructions. I noticed an immediate tan and after 24 hours it darken up a shade. After showering it was the perfect glow I was looking for. The price was totally worth it and as a fairly new mom this is just what the doctor ordered. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to get some colour, I have wry fair skin and use this year round. I had an issue with shipping but it was handled so fast and with such good customer service, it ended up being with the carrier and not the company who I bought it from! Thank you so much, 100% Will be purchased again!</li>
            <li> This product gives the appearance of a beautiful tan when used, and is easy to apply with the provided mitt.  However...I thought it was the type of tanner that actually lasts for 5 days or so, but not so.  It washes off with first shower!  So buy this if you need a pretty tan for a day or evening, but not if you&#x27;re sweating or swimming.  It has a pleasant smell compared to tanners that actually tan.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have tried every single thing out there. I even tried other spray tans. nothing workedfor me. i am very pale and have frreckles. So being pale i needed somthing that wouldnt hurt my skin. So on went my quest to finding the right solution for me. i checked out youtube reviews for days and researched. I found this one late one night and the girl was super tan. so i decided to try it...Shipping was fast so 3 days later i was Tan. i wasnt orange at all. its a very Natural looking tan. and when it fades you dont get all spotty and what not. You just have to keep lotion on your skin that will make it last longer. its super easy to apply and give a great color. i would not suggest putting it on your face though. unless you want. my face is very sensitive so i tried it and it didnt work on my face that great. so i just got a darker makeup and it looks fine. I would definitely get a full body spray tan with it, the bottle lasts for a really long time to which is a big plus :) Enjoy</li>
            <li> I was hooked on the very expensive Guerlain Terracotta Self Tan Spray that you could only get out of the U.S.  Why it wasn&#x27;t available in the US, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;All I know is now I never have to order this type of product from out of the US ever again - as long as the formula of this specific Fake Bake remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Guerlain product gave me a natural healthy look without looking overdone, but they have nothing on Fake Bake at one half the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply.  The muddy colored guide rubs in, making sure you apply completely. Don&#x27;t freak about the color.  It&#x27;s a good thing it&#x27;s the color it is, because you want to rub it in and get rid of it!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure and use the mitt and gloves included.  There are those that say the mitt uses up too much of the product.  I didn&#x27;t find that.  I found spraying the mitt then applying gave me beautiful complete smooth coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wash the gloves or the mitt.  Just put the mitt upright to dry.  I put mine on the top of a lotion bottle.  When you use the mitt again, you&#x27;ll find what product remained on the mitt reactivates!&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned and have light colored hair.  This product left me a beautiful \\&quot;tan\\&quot; that only looks on the browner side (NO orange or other funky color) as though I&#x27;ve had a great time out in the sun over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re lookin&#x27; for a \\&quot;Jershey Shore\\&quot; type of color, I believe you could achieve it with this product but it would take about 5 or 6 days to get that - awful - color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERY BEST PART I liked about this product is the smell.  I didn&#x27;t smell like I was cooking from the inside like the other self tanners smell to me.  Fake Bake has a VERY light coconut smell - don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not a heavy Bath and Body Works coconut smell.  The smell goes away in no time.  Put it on before bed, wake up to a very beautiful golden, not a freakish&lt;br /&gt;dark, St Tropez tan.&lt;br /&gt;I will ALWAYS buy this product as long as the formula remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE RECORD.  I was not paid by this company to write a great review.  I am a consumer, willing to state my age and give my honest opinion of a product in order to help others make a good purchase decision.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner. It is super easy to put on and it doesn&#x27;t leave an orange or streaky look. It also smells really good, which is an awesome perk. The directions are easy to follow as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product works just like it says.</li>
            <li> I have used tanning beds for years to get a little color on my very very pale skin, but I have always been worried in the back of my head about what kind of long term damage I was doing.  I went out on a limb to try this product, as I&#x27;ve had bad luck with sunless tanners in the past.  This one was so easy to apply, and the color guide is great so you can really tell where you have applied.  I exfoliate and apply at night, and then rinse off in the morning, and I am left with a beautiful, natural looking tan!!  No orange, splotches, or streaks! I reapply about twice a week, and it takes so much less time than driving to a tanning salon :D  Now quit reading the reviews and just buy it already, you will be happy that you did!</li>
            <li> This worked great.  It has great coverage and you have a lot of control over where it goes.  Also, it&#x27;s easy to touch up missed spots.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I am very fair and this gives my skin the most amazing sun kissed bronze color. No orange. No streaks. really easy to apply. And it&#x27;s not too dark.  It really is perfect.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... I would recommend this product to anyone that looks to look like they&#x27;ve been at a beach over the weekend.  My favorite besides the natural looking tan you get is the scent... It is not bad at all... I&#x27;ve tried numerous other self tanners you get in stores, like jergens and a few others they smell like burnt tires.. horrible, yuk.. Besides the nice looking tan you get, one of the best perks is saving a hundred bucks a month from the tanning salons and risking melanoma..&lt;br /&gt;Also the kit comes with a pouch that&#x27;s actually the applicator you use to put on the tanner, no messy hands, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I am so in love with this self tanner! I have a fair complexion and most self tanners make me orange so I am always skeptical when buying tanning products, but this makes me look so natural and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was awesome too! AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all! Even the super pricey ones, but this one is my favorite! The only negative is it fades a little odd, splotchy and almost flakes off. But that&#x27;s only after I get lazy about applying it and it fades. The color is gorgeous and natural!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, best tanner ever! Doesn&#x27;t streak, not at all orange, nice dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it was easy to apply and dried quickly but was way too light even after several applications.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pale and this is the second year in row this is my go to product because it gives me a natural, dark tan. Whenever I am complimented on my tan I always recommend this product and they end up loving it too.</li>
            <li> Perfect flawless and fast shipping</li>
            <li> i like the tone and no real smell</li>
            <li> I had to retunr because it was smelly and doesn&#x27;t dry well. I will stick with my Loreal Sublime tanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different &amp;#34;spray tans&amp;#34; to apply at home.  This is by far the best!  Will not turn you &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and the applicator mitt helps with making sure that I won&#x27;t be streaky.  I&#x27;ve ordered this same Fake Bake four times now.  For those of you worried about applying to face---I just spray twice onto the mitt and apply it--never had any problems!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and cheap! Love this!</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It burned my legs and my hair follicles were very dark when I used this. I don&#x27;t advise buying this.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I was looking for something authentic looking and without a smell.  This met both of these expectations.  The smell is tropical with just a hint of the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; smell appearing a few hours after applying the lotion.  The product washes off all clothing and bedding!  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> this is literally the best self tanner ive ever tried and im  naturally super fair</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I have ever used, hands down. I liked this stuff so much I went and bought the flawless darker. I get compliments all the time on my tan. Everyone thinks I tan in a bed, in my opinion this stuff saves you money and is better for your skin.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I can avoid going to tanning beds year-round.</li>
            <li> I used this over a little bit of colour I had from a base tan and it gave me a nice golden brown colour. I found it very easy to use and I only needed a little bit. I really like the smell (coconut). I had no streaking with this product.....usually I do with other products I&#x27;ve used, no matter how careful I am. I haven&#x27;t used this on my face...so no comment there. I will though continue to use this product and will reorder another bottle in the future.</li>
            <li> seriously the best fake tanning stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to go tanning again.  my package got here so fast. It&#x27;s only my first time using it but I already know I&#x27;m going to buy another one here real soon</li>
            <li> This goes on pretty light but definitely noticeable. It is very buildable and after the third application, you&#x27;ll have a nice summer tan. It dries very fast and it leaves no streakes. It has a strong coconut smell but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love all fake bake products. It&#x27;s a good product for fake tans. Looks natural and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to appy. Doesn&#x27;t look orange anywhere except for a hint on my knuckles which was a little brassy/dirty looking. I&#x27;m not going to let it sit on my hands for very long because they darkened the fastest even spraying the liquid on the glove first. I&#x27;m pale and tan very very little naturally so tanning beds and laying out like most girls aren&#x27;t an option so I&#x27;m very happy to have found something that looks natural even though its fake :)</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions written in one review and this product worked perferctly; exfoliate, dry off completely, add moisturizer to knees, elbows, and ankles, apply at night and shower in the morning.  I was left with great color.  I am typically very pale and left with sun damage so unfortunately, I had to give up the tanning booths and sun bathing...But now I can look as if I spent time at the beach!...</li>
            <li> its easy to use and the smell is not bad, but i think u can still smell it after few days , the colour is not orange , i didnt put on me face tho . i like the colour on the body all im gonna say is 5 star . defnatly !!! get it ppeople :)</li>
            <li> Just got it!! Only took 2 days to get from cali to ny! I applied it tomy friend and it smells wonderful. Almost like chocolate (khalua or mudslide😋) color guard is great cant wait to put it on tonight</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC!! After use, I have a beautiful golden bronze &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. : ) My boyfriend has also used this product and he loves the natural color it gives. Thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> definitely will buy this product again! And would recommend it to everyone. I bought both original and the flawless and both are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years now. Never have had a streak my tan always looks natural and everyone wonders how I keep up my flawless color. I only do one single application because I&#x27;m so naturally pale I tend to look sick. This product gives me a healthy glow. Obviously you can keep applying layers until you&#x27;re as dark as you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to basically every negative review: ANY self tanner will sweat off after application, FakeBake is just smart enough to inform you that you should apply it at night so that doesn&#x27;t happen to you. For anyone afraid to buy this product due to a negative review, please don&#x27;t be. I have used it and then went swimming the next day and the worst that happened was the color faded from my body, and I reapplied it that night. It lasts a long time and I can honestly say it has never EVER EVER turned me orange. In fact, they don&#x27;t even use yellows and oranges in this product. They use reds and browns. So unless you apply 3 or 4 applications on top of each other which I&#x27;m assuming this reviewer may have done, it will NOT turn you orange. It wouldn&#x27;t be the best selling tanning product on Amazon if it did. BUY BUY BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Awesome especially in winter. I wear it in the summer too. Water resistant but obviously not waterproof, stays on through sweat and at the pool. Would I apply this product and then go to the water park or amusement park? NO! Sweat causes any self tanner to dissipate. Be smart with what will cause sweat WITH FRICTION. Friction? That&#x27;s okay. Sweat? You&#x27;re tan won&#x27;t run. Sweat WITH friction? Just DON&#x27;T!! If you&#x27;re drying off from anything, pat your akin don&#x27;t rub.  I went to the ocean with this stuff on and nothing came off all day in the heat and sand. When applying it  I usually spray it on my skin THEN rub. Unless I am doing my face then I spray the mitt and rub. You cAn use this product over and over until you are as dark as you want to be. Shave FIRST 24 hours in advance of application. Because if you shave and them immediately apply the product, it will seep into your pores leaving you tiny dark specs. Also let your body COMPLETELY DRY hair and all before you apply. It&#x27;s even smart to blow dry your body with COOL AIR before application even if you haven&#x27;t just gotten out of the shower. I wait hours after my shower just to be sure. If you don&#x27;t you will regret it because your tan will NOT be even; mark my words. If you wait until you&#x27;re dry though everything will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wear white until you&#x27;ve rinsed off after 24 hours of having it on ! Rinsing off won&#x27;t get rid of your tan unless you scrub and even then it probably won&#x27;t come off. If you leave it on for 48 hours you can scrub and your tan will not be affected which is why I love this product. Definitely worth the buy. Be careful around your arms if you&#x27;re like me and tend to have tanner arms on the top of your forearm and paler skin on the bottom part of your arm/the inside crease of your elbow. I have my roommate do my back and the back of my shoulders and legs just to make sure it&#x27;s perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you apply it more generously to paler areas (the bottom of my forearms are super pale so I do them twice). If you&#x27;re reading these reviews to try to find out if you should buy it-buy it. Totally worth it. Like I said, it wouldn&#x27;t be the best selling tanning product on Amazon if it wasn&#x27;t awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my granddaughter and The product was nothing like it was advertised. It was a cheap immitation of a liquid/spray tanning solution. Don&#x27;t waste you time and money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot but fond that sun labs tanner actually works better and lasts longer and is only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> This product is great! The box is very pretty to me I don&#x27;t know why. The color is a good natural one. It smells ok but after awhile it can become annoying and starts to smell like normal fake tans do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A Few Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-When it arrives be sure your skin is scrubbed clean and their isn&#x27;t any dry flakes.&lt;br /&gt;-Use the included spraying tip! But be sure to just snip about a inch off it so it will fit in the bottle smoothly&lt;br /&gt;-After every use of the buffing pad clean it off and hang it to dry in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t apply this if you have not bathed recently.&lt;br /&gt;-Take it slow with your face, don&#x27;t continuously re-spray your face after it has been sprayed before.  (and by spray I mean spraying the buffing pad and applying it to the skin) Respraying your arms and legs is fine however.&lt;br /&gt;-Try to apply it at night and sleep with it. This is better so you aren&#x27;t active during the six hour curing period.&lt;br /&gt;-Using this twice in a day is fine but don&#x27;t use to much, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-If the tan looks uneven then use a light lotion to go over the troubled area.&lt;br /&gt;-If you can try to get a light sun tan. This will dramatically help deepen your overall color. Even if you just get red it will really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole thing of spraying a fake tanner on a pad and rubbing it on your skin seemed so far fetched to me. But the soft pad and light misty tan spray made the operation quite smooth and very easy. Its so much better then self tanning lotion!! Make no mistake this is a great product if you want a great tan!</li>
            <li> I am pretty pale in the winter months, so I needed something to make my skin look sun kissed and this is it! It doesnt look too orangey, you can see where you are applying it which helped alot with streaking. I do recommend exfoliating b/c dry skin will cause discoloration. Other than that, product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I discovered this product. It&#x27;s going to be my go-to self tanner for a long time. I can layer it on if I want to, or just put a small amount on to give me a brown glow. I took off one star because it can smell sometimes (that fake tanner smell..).</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t make me look completely fake as I am a very pale red-head.  I just wanted a little bit of color for my bridal shower and rehearsal dinner.  This did the trick.  Was not orange like at all.  Followed someone&#x27;s advice; by using scrubbing gloves during shower, then applying to the mitt and rubbing lightly on skin.  In some places I did, spray directly on my legs and chest and then spread around.  One piece of advice though is to place a towel a underneath you when doing this and always wash the mitt after using and let air dry.</li>
            <li> Love love love. Highly recommend. Great color payoff after second application. I will definitely buy this product again. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have !!!! Love this product!! A little gose a long ways and it doesn&#x27;t make you Orange!!!!</li>
            <li> Great self tanner. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly. Gives nice golden color, not orange.</li>
            <li> I went thru about 3 bottle of this over the Summer. Looks very natural, so no more tanning salons for me!</li>
            <li> This works but I was disappointed that adding layers did not darken my skin at all and it did not last very long. I reapplied every day to keep up the color. Including something like a sealant similar to what the salons use would give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell like some of the other self tanning products out there.  Amazon has the BEST prices too!</li>
            <li> Left this on overnight, it was easy to put on, smelled great, and was a beautiful color. After I took a shower the next morning the color was completely gone like I didn&#x27;t use it at all. It&#x27;s good if you want some color before going out but that&#x27;s about it. Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading thousands upon thousands of reviews for sunless tanner. This seemed to have the most amount of positive feedback. It&#x27;s great if you want to be tan for the night, but as soon as you shower the following day all the color completely washes off. This does NOT give a lasting tan like it&#x27;s advertised to. I&#x27;ve had much better luck and nicer results with ULTA sunless tanning spray and Neutrogena Micro Mist. This fake bake does smell nice though unlike most other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Great product. People couldn&#x27;t tell it was a fake tan. Make sure you apply at night. Take a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. It comes out WAY to dark. Generally fake tanners are a nice orange color, but this stuff comes out deep brown, almost black and you really can&#x27;t do anything that night. You have to marinate in it over night, and the small is god awful, and most of it washed off in the shower. I had some terrible streaks, despite using gloves. I had to do a few coats of it. Once I got a few coats and a few showers on me... it turned out really nice. The only problem is, for the price, you are probably better off just going to a tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use gloves because it stains so bad. I only used it once... and then I had it in my cabinet for about two months and went to use it again and it had turned a horrible green color and went rotten.</li>
            <li> Went on a little green looking so I was a little nervous, but in the morning when I woke up the tan looked great. Would definitely reccomend doing it the night before you want to be tan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Wish I would have known about this a long time ago! It works great for a quick and simple tan!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it, I&#x27;ve done 2 applications this week to get my base color and wow I am glad I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I find this liquid very easy to apply, especially because the awesome mitt. I also made it a decision to add Fake Bake flawless into my weekly routine. I am naturally tan due to my heritage so this liquid tan enhances my skin to a bronze toasty look. Totally reminds me of how the actual sun would tan me so it looks very natural! Great way to relieve yourself of high sun exposures once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first at home spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used. The box has everything you will need for application, so thats nice that you wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase a mitt or gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I did try St. Topez tanning mousse twice and the second time for application I had this really weird itchy reaction to it. So I discontinued the use of it. I can&#x27;t really compare Fake Bake to St. Tropez cause of that but I maybe someone can relate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i&#x27;ll update on how this product held up on a long term basis.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned girl.  I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t look orange and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  This is the perfect solution.  The bottle is a spray that goes onto a mitt. The little glove helps you apply evenly all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;On my first application, I missed a few places on my legs, so it did look a little splotchy.  But after about one use, you get it down!  It does create naturally beautiful color and tan.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a light tropical scent, which is actually a welcome change from most of the tan in a bottle solutions.  This is a light smell that is easily masked if you want to tan in the morning instead of night.  The box suggest applying at night and washing off residue in the shower.  When I did so, I didn&#x27;t notice any color washing off.&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled at the purchase and happy with the results.  I will continue using this while I build up a summer base tan.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the mitt really makes this an easy and quick self tanner to use. I think it takes me about ten minutes to apply this to my entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color looks very real. You can even use this in the morning, before work or school, although most would recommend applying at night. I like to use it in the morning because the color guard gives you an awesome, dark tan right away and it really does dry quickly enough so that you can get dressed in about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell! Not when you put it on, and not even after you&#x27;ve had it on for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it on your face, just make sure you use one spray on the mitt and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget your ears and hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is not bad at all for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are very pale, it may take up to four or five uses to get the color you desire, but this is ok for me, because I apply it in the morning until I get the color I want. Until you shower, the color guard will give you a real, dark looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may very well need to use this self tanner daily. I do, or at least every other day, but I&#x27;m as pale as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long a bottle would last using it daily, but I will update this to let you all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Other self tanners that had much longer lasting color and that have also given me my desirable color after one use, but those tend to be the orangey ones. Yet I still stick to this self tanner because I&#x27;ve never made embarrassing mistakes with it, it&#x27;s such a better color, it&#x27;s sooo much easier to apply. I feel HOT with the color it gives me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate skin before using! Self tanners concentrate more in dry areas with dead skin. You can use a scrub, or an exfoliating glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer often, but never before or within four hours after applying fake bake. You want to keep your skin moisturized for this same reason!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have anybody to do your back for you, purchase a back brush and slip the glove onto it. I&#x27;ve found this makes it simple to get your back .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spray the tanner directly onto most parts of your body, but for parts such as your face, hands, feet, elbows, knees, neck and back, you will want to spray the tanner onto your mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always rub in circular motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your mitt after every two uses. You can do this in the washing machine with cold water on a delicate cycle and hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply too much pressure when rubbing it in the the mitt. This might leave fuzzier on you! A delicate touch with do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using, you will want to cut about an inch off of the spray tube. You will notice that its much too long for the bottle. It comes separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spray a lot on your body, or a little. I am still experimenting with that: maybe I would get a longer lasting tan if I sprayed a lot onto my skin versus the amount I use now, which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> My daughter actually told me abu this na dthen let me try her once before i ordered my own.  There is no streaking, no lines or orange tint to my skin.  I have very light skin and am happy with the natural glow it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> After alittle trouble with the shipping, product was on backorder and wasn&#x27;t told. When I contacted the seller they were quick to reply and my product was delivered within days. As for the Fake Bake its amazing, light fresh smell not over powering at all. Easy to apply and not orange!! With a medium skin tone I tan easily and this gave me a flawless dark glow to start the summer off with. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Instant tan and is easy enough to apply even minutes before going out for the day/night. Even if you just want your feet tan in the fall/winter while wearing flats. No fake tan smell- it actually smells kind of tropical. The mit is amazing and makes the application &amp;#34;flawless.&amp;#34; It is fast drying but not to worry because you can fix any streaks or lines by just applying more in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you mix in your hands with a body lotion it makes the application THAT much faster and longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you&#x27;re not going to use this product often then it may not be the best purchase for you *because after about 2 months or so the liquid starts to develop a greenish color which transcends onto the skin. You can fix it by just applying more, but just makes the process longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I have re-purchased this about 4 times. LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love the fake bake originial, this goes on spotting and you can never truly blend it even when expoliating, its good for day right after its applied but thats it, don&#x27;t waste money stick to orignal lotion.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item is that it does give you color and it smells good during application.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it stinks later that day. Like a burnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt causes uneven spreading on the body. If you put it on your face and hands, when you wash them the same day or even when you brush your teeth, it washes off and leaves streaks on your face. After you shower the next day, it washes off in some places but, not others so, it will never be an even tan.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a Store Manager at a Tanning Salon in a beach town, so being bronze is a big deal in my profession. I use my salons spray tan instead of the UV tanning in an effort to protect my skin. To maintain my spray tan I layer with this Fake Bake product. I love how brown the color is, versus the &#x27;orange&#x27; effect that DHA (sunless tanner) can sometimes give. I have used this product in the past alone with out a spray tan underneath and it truly is &#x27;flawless&#x27;. It can really help you achieve a dark color by using some days in a row to build up. Even my family can&#x27;t tell that its not the sun giving me the tan!Yay for fake bake!! Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> It really has a nice color to it and its smells amazing! The thing is is that this is my first time using a tanning product and I can&#x27;t get it evenly distributed. my overall body was pretty good not going to lie, but areas like your feet hands knees are super tricky and give the FAKE tan away so easily. Some parts of my body were patchy but overall it was pretty good. I won&#x27;t be using this again because is hard for me to do. It takes about a week to completely wash off if you only used it one day. The tan would probably have lasted 2 weeks probably three if I didn&#x27;t scrub it off every day to get rid of it. If YOU are already familiar with FAKE TANNING LOTIONS and products then you definitely have to GET THIS!! You will probably LOVE IT. I just don&#x27;t have the patience and time to get the fake tan looking flawless for me.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best products from Fake N Bake. It does give you a darker color and the glove is great for applying it evenly.</li>
            <li> I have used many self less tanning products and always an orange hugh, but this is awesome!  Best by far, they give you a glove to apply which is great and I had no streaking and even put it on my face and everyone thought I had been tanning.  Put lotion all over your skin before you apply an I put a little on first to see how it would tur out and then a little more the next day.  The amount you put on is what color it turns our to be, it doesnt get much drker as the day goes on, shake up the bottle before use and cut the stem on the bottle. LOVE IT  and WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> It was a good item for the price, except for my hands, I like that the tanning mitt does a good job of minimum streaks on the body. But for some reason it doesn&#x27;t blend in on my hands,and when I tried to put the fake and bake contents on my hands it turned them ORANGE! I thought it was me and i should blend it in more with the mitt but i tried many more times and it was the same result. It says in the directions do not put lotion prier to application but i did on my hands since it was not going on smoothly and still same results.. so just watch out for that. I do not think i will be ordering this again unless it turns out to be the absolute best tanning product after I try other tanning products.</li>
            <li> I just got this item with good expectations.&lt;br /&gt;But i think there&#x27;s no instruction on usage...&lt;br /&gt;Could anyone let me know how to use this effieciently without side-effect...&lt;br /&gt;Once I get to know it, I&#x27;ll give more information on this item experiencing later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far,,,, 5 star considering fast delivery. :)</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product, but just did not work for me...it looked fake....also caused my skin to itch very badly...</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used. Although I haven&#x27;t tried too many different ones, this one goes on smoothly and there really aren&#x27;t any streaks. You can see exactly where you have sprayed it on and rubbed it in so you don&#x27;t miss spots. I just wish the glove would last a little longer then it has, as it tends to leave fuzzies behind even after it&#x27;s been washed.</li>
            <li> I received this in the 2 day of shipping requirements.  I tried this item today and loved it.  I cut the spray tube alittle smaller and it stops the product from leaking out of the top of the bottle when applying it.  I watched a few Youtube videos on how to get the best coverage and application.  The price is awesome on Amazon.  I have applied it a few times because I like a darker tan.  You can smell alittle of that self tanner smell but today is the first day.  After I shower tomorrow and add another application I should be set.</li>
            <li> This product is a god send! I love the way my skin looks and feels with a little sun-kissed glow, NOT leather couch skin or cheeto skin (You know the people i&#x27;m talking about), but just a nice natural base. I used to tan once a week, but tanning beds are SO awful for you (I cant emphasize how much so), and I HATE the yo-yo skin color effect from burning, tanning and fading you get from infrequent use. Makeup shades look off (god forbid, the FOUNDATION LINE!!!) and its obvious to other people when your skin is constantly a different shade. With this product I can extend the amount of time between tanning sessions (about once or twice a month for me), without any noticeable change in my skin tone! I use this product mostly on my face/neck area because those are the areas that fade quickly on my body. It&#x27;s a little dark when you first apply, but I use it before bed and a lot comes off when I wash my face in the morning. Most importantly, THERE ISN&#x27;T AN ORANGE STREAK IN SIGHT! This bottle also lasts a really long time, a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried work well, but run out quickly even though im usually only doing a small part of my body. The glove is also a great application tool, I was skeptical at first, but trust me, its amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great... Didn&#x27;t like it on my fingers and toes but other than that it worked fantastically! Great for the sudden need of a tan.</li>
            <li> I used to go spray tanning and that started to get spendy, but I found this, and I LOVE it! I will be buying more and again!</li>
            <li> Great self tanner. Tans evenly with beautiful color. I have always hated the smell of the types of sprays and lotions but this one smells great. Lasts for a good amount of time too!</li>
            <li> Liked the product.  East to apply except my back (who doesn&#x27;t have that issue).  Need to invest in a decent application mit.  This one isn&#x27;t the best quality and pilled a bit.  If not for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have olive skin.  I am not fair skinned.  This was easy to apply, fast drying and didn&#x27;t rub off.  I acheived great color on my face and legs.  I did not apply to arms as I&#x27;m already pretty tan on that area.  Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff ! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanning products, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m tired of tanning in a bed every day. &amp; this is by FAR the best one i have ever used ! It goes on SO easy, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, or gross ! I prefer to use this stuff right after I take a shower, &amp; before bed. But if you&#x27;d like to put it on before you leave in the morning, you can do that too, &amp; it works just as good ! It also doesn&#x27;t leave you orange, like most self tanners do. It&#x27;s a nice golden/brown tan. It also smells VERY good, compared to most self tanners. It doesn&#x27;t have a self tanner smell to it at all, &amp; I love that ! However, I use quite a bit of it, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it would for most people. I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bottle, just to make sure I have it whenever the first one runs out ! I&#x27;d say it works the best if you already have a base tan, like I do. I&#x27;m not pale, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works the same for someone with with a base tan, than someone without ! I usually apply this stuff 1 or 2 times a week, &amp; it works great that way. Be sure to exfoliate before you use this, &amp; keep your skin MOISTURIZED. I use Tinted Love by Designer Skin, which is a moisturizer with a little bit of self tanner in it, &amp; I absolutely love that stuff as well ! Anyway, this stuff is amazing, &amp; you should try it ! This is the ONLY self tanner I&#x27;ll EVER use !</li>
            <li> it looks so natural and no one can believe it&#x27;s from a bottle.  yes, love this stuff, would totally recommend and I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every self tanner on the market, this one worked well. It is not my favorite for a few reasons, partially due to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy and non-messy application with the mitt, product dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Good value for quality of the product- the bottle lasted me several full-body applications.&lt;br /&gt;3. Color is natural, a golden tan on my very fair skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Because this is not a lotion, you need to be very mindful of exfoliating and applying lotion to dry areas- I get a bit lazy sometimes when using a self tanning lotions,  but there is no skipping those steps here. Not a big drawback, as I should be following those golden rules regardless. Also, this product turned into a blotchy mess when I used it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. The mitt can soak up a lot of product- when spray the product on my skin and use the mitt quickly in circular motions, it is evident that a lot of the product is soaking into the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;3. Color is not very buildable. I used this 4 days in a row, and still hadn&#x27;t achieved a nice tan. I wasn&#x27;t looking for something very dark, but couldn&#x27;t even obtain a medium tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched back to the Fake Bake lotion following this product, and I prefer that Fake Bake to this one.</li>
            <li> I liked this self tanner pretty well, it smelled good. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it didnt have a 360 spray nozzle plus it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and works better than any tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. I look like I&#x27;ve  had a week in Florida after one application</li>
            <li> This looks so real, I love it. Goes on so easy with the glove, you cant make any mistakes. It smells great too. The only thing is I wish it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> I have had this for only 2 days and I love it. First of all I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday (great) I love the color, it&#x27;s easy to use and it makes me feel so good to have the glowing skin. I would recommend this</li>
            <li> 5 STAR BECAUSE IT IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GREAT! APPLIES GREAT! LASTS LONG! MAKES SKIN SOFTER!&lt;br /&gt;I AM A TANAHOLIC AND THIS IS MY NEW GO TO! THE GLOVE U CAN WASH WITH LAUNDRY DETERGENT!! STAYS SOFT. IDK WHAT THEESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT &amp;#34;SHEDDING&amp;#34; AND LEAVES MARKS.. OBVIOUSLY U DONT KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT. I HAVE OLIVE SKIN ALREADY BUT THIS STUFF WORKS AWESOME.  ANYWAYS, I USE JERGENS NATURAL TANNER IN MEDIUM BEFORE I APPLY THIS, MAKES IT EASIER TO SPREAD, ALSO I SPRAY ON MY BODY NOT THE GLOVE. THIS STUFF IS A TANNING SALON MONEY SAVER!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it colors you immediately. I was able to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and ten minutes later put on my white summer evening dress. COOL</li>
            <li> Nice product which gives you a very nice and smooth tan.&lt;br /&gt;But i dont agree with the nice smell. At the end of each day i still have the typical fake-tan-smell in my nose.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It was recommended to me by a friend and I was very hesitant about it since this was my first foray into self-tanning. However, a year later I can confidently say this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is simple (even for a non-beauty nut like myself), the color is natural-looking, and the smell is very nice! Any stain I&#x27;ve gotten on my clothes or sheets has easily washed out, so no worries there either. I usually apply at night after taking a shower and shaving/exfoliating well. Then on it goes (it dries quickly too!) and I&#x27;m off to bed. The next morning I&#x27;ll rinse and can clearly see the stain coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is stupid proof as long as you read and follow the directions!</li>
            <li> Nothing get my tanner, and in the most even way. It is instant! The only problem is I had to say goodbye to white forever. This tanner will permanently die white red/orange. It never comes out. I have tank top that I sweat in and the arm pits turned red 9 months ago. They are still red. Be careful using it anywhere you don&#x27;t want it. Other than that it is a dream come true!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I had no problems with turning orange like you do with some products. It drys really quick and is easy to apply. I would be careful while applying around the ankles and the back of the foot because I applied it to my foot and decided to go back over my ankles and the back and sides of my foot about a hour later because it looked like it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my legs and I did get a little streaking after that on my foot and I tried applying the Xen Tan Blending Balm but it didn&#x27;t help. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet. And I did exfoliate my legs and feet before applying and I wouldn&#x27;t shave the day of application because from my experience I did get little brown dots where the hair grows out.</li>
            <li> very good product it dries very fast just make sure u put a towel on the floor when u apply it other wise it will stain your floor, the product is very good and leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li> This and the St Tropez are the two best tanners on the market, and I have tried them all! Million dollar tan, sun goddess, SUn, you name it! This one is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This is my first self tan product. Works flawlessly on my asian skin. And it comes with a professional mitt that makes no streaks at all. Fully dry in like 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is great for those of us who want a good self tanner but don&#x27;t want to pay for the St. Tropez.&lt;br /&gt;Girls, self tanner is self tanner. It will eventually smell like self tanner. However, Fake Bake has a nice coconut smell when it is applied but you will notice after three or four hours that it will start to smell like self tanner. I don&#x27;t care and just apply it before bed. That being said, this is an easy product to use. They provide you with the gloves &amp; mitt to keep from streaking.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product fades nicely and doesn&#x27;t get blotchy when it&#x27;s fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: because it&#x27;s a spray, I suggest standing in your shower while spraying it on. The spray might get on your floor, walls, etc. and to keep it in one place &amp; easy to clean up. It&#x27;s best to stand in the shower or in your bathroom on a towel.</li>
            <li> i was so pale i really think i was glowing in the dark! one application and i&#x27;m a bronze beauty! love love love this! telling all my girlfriends about this. easy application smells amazing GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> product has a great smell, it smells  like coconut does not smell like normal self tanners. Wish the color lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> I was going to the tanning bed hibitually to prepare for spring break until I found this little gem :) This stuff is the best,  it doesn&#x27;t smell funky and fake other self tanners,  it&#x27;s color guard gives you an instant boost of a bronzy brown color (not orange at all!), and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  You just can&#x27;t beat the quality of this product.  You will get a better color from this in one use than you would from using a tanning bed for months,  plus it&#x27;s safe for your skin!  The only con I have is how messy it can be. Just make sure to wear the latex gloves with the mit you get with the bottle or else you may risk your hands being stained.  The seller was also really great!</li>
            <li> I am an impatient fair-skinned brunette that can tan if in the sun long enough - but don&#x27;t want the sun damage.  Over the past 15 years I have bought almost every drugstore self-tan lotion out there.  I found the gradual lotions took too long (sometimes weeks), the sprays were uneven and stained clothes and they all reeked.  This stuff applies flawlessly, dries within 5 minutes, has a realistic color and does not reek.  I can get a faint whiff several hours after application but it doesn&#x27;t last.  I do live the humid south and if you apply this and then go get sweaty you do see the streaks.  It seems to be the same excess that washes off the next shower - but just so you know.  And like any self-tanner it can make those rough knees look darker.  I just avoid the front of the knee and apply around.  No more gradual lotions for me - I may have just found &#x27;The One&#x27; after 15 years.</li>
            <li> honestly the ritual for putting this stuff on is a pain I find. the mitt works great the bottle doesnt leak if you dont use the sprayer which I don&#x27;t. but the color fades within days if you don&#x27;t re apply. so every two to three days i have to not only scrub myself i have to then moisturize and then use this. those who are that committed to tans I salute you, for me its like a once a week thing</li>
            <li> Terrible orange color, worse than any product I have tried.  Why did they stop making Mabelline Solar Energy, the best there was.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this 5 starts because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my favorite (Million Dollar Tan).  I use this as a quick fix.  It immediately gives you color.  So it&#x27;s great if I forget or don&#x27;t have time to apply my Million Dollar Tan the night before.  It&#x27;s messy because it&#x27;s a spray, but I just lay a towel down or use it in the shower stall.</li>
            <li> some tips for this product:&lt;br /&gt;1: If you are allergic to latex gloves, buy the senstive kind. You&#x27;ll want good gloves.&lt;br /&gt;2: Test a small area ( some skin is senstive to the ingredients in this bottle)&lt;br /&gt;3: Exfoliate!! yes, Exfoliate and moisturize before applying. I did it three hours before applying the spray. It did wonders for the eveness.Exfoliate twice a week&lt;br /&gt;4: The VELVET side ( NOT the foam side!!!) is what you use to Polish the skin. And yes, rinse the mitt after use to keep it clean and in shape. I used a ponytail holder to keep the Mitt on my hand from sliding.&lt;br /&gt;5: For Lighter skin, it may take two applications before a set tan is achieved. Do not be dettered, its like most things...it takes  a few applications to get to the level you would like for it to sustain. I Had to do two Base applications before I was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;6: Moisturizers are your best friend!&lt;br /&gt;7: For face application I suggest using a small talfa pad, Spray a wee bit on the pad and blot on face, followed by a circular motion to even it out. (Yes you should exfoliate your facial skin before use too!!)&lt;br /&gt;8: For your hands ....Scrub scrub scrub your knuckle areas or else it gets blotchy. Mine were raw red for two hours and then when I applied the spray (using a talfa pad) it didnt look like bright orange marbles ! Which was my mistake the very first time I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;9: Coconut moisturizers around the knee and joint areas alleviates the blotchiness too. I did this two minutes before applying and it worked!! Also toned down the areas that absorbed dry patch areas by using the moisturizer, it made things even.&lt;br /&gt;10: Overall I find this product to be worth every cent! (As others said) It gets Messy, Try to find a spray nozzle that is less spritzy and more guided. One that mists perhaps. I used one from my old hairpump bottles, its got a better stream.&lt;br /&gt;11: This product will no doubt last me one-two months! That is better then spa&#x27;s that charge way more for a single fake tan application.</li>
            <li> this product is great in terms of it does not streak or become blotchy. It gives a awesome golden tan, did not irritate my skin (which can be sensitive) and has a great smell to it. Also after applying this and you let it dry for a few seconds you can put on your clothes with out worrying about it getting on your clothing. It is very messy in terms of when spraying it on your body alot of product lands up on the floor. So either spray onto mit or stand in shower to spray yourself down. Only downside it it will wash off in a few days...I think it took 2 washes and it was gone. But use it for a nite out or to go to an event ...its perfect for just that.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works perfectly and shipping is really fast!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best tanning spray you will ever use aloge with xen tan blending balm looks like a natural tan without the damage of the sun</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews for products but I felt it was necessary for Fake Bake. As a naturally fair person I&#x27;ve always been trying to find the perfect product to give me a good/natural looking tan (including tanning beds). Most of the tanners i&#x27;ve used either didn&#x27;t leave enough color, turned out orange, had that terribly unattractive smell, or came out splotchy/streaky. I saw the review for this product on youtube and after seeing the ratings here I decided to purchase it, and im SO GLAD I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Instant NATURAL looking color (not even a tint of orange) that just gets better as the hours go on, and it&#x27;s build-able depending on how dark you wanna go (I find two days in a row of application is a medium-dark tan)&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing for a self tanner, very similar to coconut tanning oil (My boyfriend actually LIKES how I smell after using it)&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing or sheets, dries extremely quickly and goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;-The mitt gets rid of any possibility of streaking or splotches as long as you blend, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about washing your hands afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Fades a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;d say you couldn&#x27;t go for more than a few days/a week without re-applying&lt;br /&gt;-Excess spray can make a slight mess in your bathroom (but it takes 5 seconds to wipe away with a wipe or papertowel)&lt;br /&gt;-A decent amount of product comes off if you apply at night in shower in the morning like recommended, I prefer to apply in the morning/afternoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to get any water or lotion on yourself after applying for at least 4 hours, but right after I put it on my hands I find putting a tiny bit of lotion of my knuckles smooths out any lines and makes it look perfect! Also make sure to moisturize on days you arent using fake bake, it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d give this product 4.5 stars, only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because of the fade factor! Fake Bake gave me a tan in three days that would of taken me one/two weeks using the tanning bed, Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Im very pale skinned and stopped using tanning beds because they destroyed my skin and this is a great product for people like me! You get instant results! The only thing i would say is as soon as you exfoliate your skin the color goes away. But it is totally worth spending 15 dollars a month on as opposed to 80 dollars on a tanning membership and i dont mind reapplying everyday because it smells great! No DHA odors! Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of self-tanning lotions and most will give me skin irritation after several applications.  The regular Fake Bake did a great job but after a time I began to get a small amount of itching where it was applied.  It was not as bad as with other products but it was the same type, perhaps an allergy to a chemical in the product.  The Fake Bake Flawless has worked well and does not seem to irritate my skin on my arms and legs.  It is much thinner in consistency so one must be careful applying it so as not to spill it all over the place.</li>
            <li> The overall idea of this product is great.  The formula is light, dries quickly, and goes on perfectly even with the mitt included.  The tan is super easily buildable over just a few days and is pretty long lasting.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the guide color can be a little deceiving about how tan you are actually getting.  Also when you stop the tanning treatments and it wears off, it came off much like too-tan skin; flaky and patchy ):  I really like it overall, just be sure to exfoliate often!</li>
            <li> Worked just as it said! I believe I had to look at reviews on how to use it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Im curious if anyone else received this with a purple cap and sprayer?  All the pictures of it has gold cap and sprayer&lt;br /&gt; I still used it, and seems to work pretty  well.  Haven&#x27;t showered yet,so I will update my review in the am. Smells great going on,its been about 5 hou7 and I  smell a little like self tanner. The yummy coconut smell is gone. We&#x27;ll see. .</li>
            <li> I love the mitt application, NO STREAKS and you use VERY little product.  This fake-bake creates a nice light-med brown color with no orange undertones.  Very pretty.  Also, this is super blendable.  I applied lotion on my knees and elbows and xen-tan blending balm on my hands and feet pre-tan.  Then blended at my ankles and wrists post tan and it looks perfect.  The bronzer is great because you can see where you applied it, but shower before going in pool :)  Also used this on my face.  Looks great, no streaks.  Will be buying this again year round!&lt;br /&gt;(30 years old, pasty irish/ northern Minnesotan skin tone)</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It goes on evenly, leaving no streaks. It looks very natural. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a Pale girl, no lie! It is so hard for me to get a tan. During winter i am ghostly like. I can get some color in a tanning bed but i have to go like every day and i just dont like it. I feel like im totally damaging my skin so i end up not going; hence i stay white. Ive tried many many many sunless tanners. ive heard of fake bake before but for some reason i just never tried it. i tried everything else and found some lotions that i liked for the color however when it would fade i looked like i had a disease! So i finally tried this and it was amazing. the smell isnt bad at all and the best part IT DRIES INSTANTLY. no exageration its dries so fast. this stuff is easy to put on. i dont see how you can mess up because i even did my hands and feet and they look awesome! If you are tired of frying your skin in the tanning bed and want to look good when you&#x27;re older but want that summer glow try it you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It definitely does not make your skin turn that obnoxious orange color that you get from most self tanners.  What I do is put it on before bed and wash it off in the morning and you can definitely see a difference but not too drastic!!  Great alternative to sitting in a tanning bed and risking cancer.  The only thing that needed to be modified was the spray nozzle...it was a little bit too long so hold it up to the bottle and cut it, other than that, it was a great buy!! 5+ stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the only thing that bugged me was the shipping, so product I give 5 stars and the shipper I give 4.5 stars :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now GO OUT AND GET THIS PRODUCT!! :p</li>
            <li> Washes off after once is the shower, but great for a quick one time bronze.</li>
            <li> This tanning spray is amazing. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used! And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different tanning lotions and sprays. It doesn&#x27;t rub off on sheets or clothes! Even white clothes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self tanners and this is by far the best. I was torn between this product and SunLabs, but this one was cheaper. I&#x27;m so glad I went with this one! I tan really easy in the summer but I wanted a quick fix to last me until I can physically go outside and lay out, and this was perfect. I bought some exfoliating body scrub from Ulta and used that in the shower, then towel dried off and put a little cocoa butter lotion all over my body (I have super dry skin). I put extra lotion on elbows, knees, and wrists because the instructions suggest putting lotion on these spots no matter what. I wiped off any excess lotion and used the spray. it dried so quickly! I would suggest only doing one arm at a time and doing your legs in two sections (top and bottom) because the product dries so quickly. Also, spray the product directly on your skin because if you spray on the mitt, it absorbs most of the product. the only time i sprayed on the mitt instead of my skin directly is when I used it on my face, the backs of my hands, and my feet. This is by-far the best tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used, even my boyfriend approves, and he HATES self tanners because im generally smelly and orange. This product smells great and gives instant bronzers so you can literally apply it and then walk out the door. it doesnt stain your clothes or bed sheets either. I slept in the same bed as my boyfriend about an hour after applying, and we were both afraid that some of the product would rub off onto him throughout the night, but it didnt! it dries quickly and is perfect. Definitely worth buying! And buy from this seller! Item was delivered a day before expected, which is always a nice surprise (:</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was aiming for! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a great self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t cost too much, would give me a great, even, strong tan (that doesn&#x27;t look fake like those girls people make fun of, but one that actually would look as if I just got back from a vacation in the Caribbean) for someone like me- I have highly sensitive and dry skin, and atopic dermatitis. That is very hard to do. I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of lotions and creams of all sorts, but all got me itching like a maniac by the end of the day (sometimes even the hour), and didn&#x27;t work for me that much in terms of an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;I am light skinned, borderline fair skin, so it means a lot if something actually gives me an actual tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was amazing. I&#x27;m in love with it. I used it two days ago, and I no longer wear any foundation (I actually just add a little cream blush on my cheeks to make it look more realistic. I know, I&#x27;m crazy!) because it makes me glow. I don&#x27;t use eye makeup, because my green eyes just pop with the tan, the way they do when you get that bronze glow.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell, it dries super quickly so I can just go ahead and put my clothes back on in a matter of just a couple of minutes, and they actually recommend sleeping with it- which means no more awkward standing with arms and legs spread waiting for it to dry enough so I could just sit down even.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t rub off on any of my clothes, which is pretty remarkable, considering I actually sprayed some on my arms and back, put on white silk pajamas and went to sleep, and nothing came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this. My skin isn&#x27;t irritated, I look healthy and tanned and feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great too, no more harsh chemical smells.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and application process was so quick, I was actually like: &amp;#34;wait, what? I&#x27;m all done? No way!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night I immediately bought 2 more bottles, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who&#x27;ve been looking for that awesome glowing tan, but never found the right product for them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow. For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually. This is a tan for pulling all the stops, without looking fake, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I bought this :)this to people who&#x27;ve been looking for that awesome glowing tan, but never found the right product for them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want that much of a tan, and just want some gradual glow. For that I&#x27;d highly recommend Jergens, actually. This is a tan for pulling all the stops, without looking fake, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li> Stuff works pretty damn good, and doesn&#x27;t make me orange, just make sure you scrape off your skin first so it doesn&#x27;t get spotty, also wash the mitt you dirty hippy.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is a pretty good product.  The tan is a medium tone, which only lasts about 2 days after use.  The mitt is handy for application - that also comes with a few gloves to wear underneath.&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle did leak  - faulty design, so I just switched it to another spray bottle I had and absolved the issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to spray almost the entire soft side of the mitt and apply in circular motions...or else the color will saturate to heavy in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Good product to have without a risk of getting a skin cancer and cost cheaper than go to the tanning salon. Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t make me look orange.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond fabulous.  It works beautifully without any streaking (follow directions to the letter - i.e. you MUST exfoliate all areas you intend to &#x27;tan&#x27; as well as use a balm of some kind on ankles, wrists, knees and elbows to blend in and prevent areas from getting too dark or blotchy.  If you follow the directions you will truly look as though you were on a week&#x27;s vacation in a tropical climate - without the dangerous exposure to UV rays or the need to sit for hours under the hot rays of the sun.  The color is so natural and was almost instant.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  And though the company does make a specific product for the face, I used the body tanner and it was totally fine.  I&#x27;ll be using this year round from this point forward.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I have fair/light skin and was wary when I received this and sprayed it into the mitt, it looked very dark and I didn&#x27;t want to look like a lovely shade of oompa loompa before an event I was looking forward to. I bit the bullet and tried the product after searching for a video on youtube on how to apply it properly. I was very pleased with the results. it has a very dark color gaurd which I appreciated when applying.  It washed away naturally and I didn&#x27;t get the strange flaking that some other products have.  The best part about this tanner was the lack of DHA smell, instead, it has a nice coconut smell when applying and after washing off the color gaurd it does not smell to me personally at all. Overall I would definitely recommend to people looking for a darker natural looking tan without a nasty smell. Just a tip- make sure to wash the mitt after every application or you will ruin it.  Hope others enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Even though the reviews were good, I was still skeptical ,as I am of any self tanning product.  I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it worked really amazing, and just after one night.  I felt like my skin was glowing the next day and I had such a pretty color.  Love this stuff, and it really was easy to apply, and I didnt get all of that yucky orange streaking on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> First, some information about my skin tone: I&#x27;m blonde with green eyes and I turn purple when I&#x27;m cold and red when I&#x27;m hot. That&#x27;s my paleness. I tried this last night after my bath (exfoliated, lotioned my knobby parts, dried myself very well) and it is AMAZING! Immediately saw the color and it built up over time. I haven&#x27;t showered just yet this morning and I know some will wash off, but my first impression is VERY GOOD. I&#x27;m not orange in the least. It looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun for a few weeks (or months in my case, since I have such a time getting a tan). So happy I found this product! So easy to use! Had to get my husband to help with my back bits (he didn&#x27;t mind).</li>
            <li> So, after realizing that the tanning bed was not the best option for my skin, I decided to try a self-tanner. I really had no where to even start, but after viewing a YouTube video about how great Fake Bake was, I decided that for the great price and \\&quot;said results\\&quot; that I would try it. Now I am 20yrs old, and I do have sensitive skin on my face, however I would never consider that the skin on the rest of my body is sensitive. The color Fake Bake produced was beautiful, for I am not pale anyways, but during the winter I do look a little dull. However, the next day I noticed bumps all over my body in different places where I have NEVER gotten a bump or rash! I was really disappointed because it did produce a great color but obviously it was not the right tanner for me. That would be my caution to using this product. If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin I WOULD NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly I would save your money. It gives you a tan but goes away as soon as you shower. Would be good for a one time event I guess... I&#x27;ll stick with a tanning bed</li>
            <li> I like the application mitt. However, there is still some streaking during application and I found it worked best when you use Vaseline with it. This product gave me the tan that I was looking for and did NOT make me orange. Everyone has been asking what i have been using and want it!</li>
            <li> This product works well and has a natural color. I have tried many self tanners and would rate this higher than most. It is relatively cheap and love that it comes with a mitt. My main issue is that the spray is messy and it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Still prefer at tropez mousse.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! as long as you do it right with the mit, should be even coloring. Make sure beforehand to cover elbows, knees, hands with some sort of lotion, i prefer hemp lotion. Everyone complimented my color at work monday asking if I went on a vacation. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute sh!t. It looks real. You can make yourself look incredibly sun-kissed without getting melanoma or wrinkles or becoming a disgusting dragon lady or spending $40 on a spray tan that lasts 7 - 10 days. And you can do it in THREE MINUTES. It&#x27;s amazing. I cannot imagine life without this product. The only time I ever regret applying it is when I get drunk and decide to fake tan. That is a mistake. I woke up this morning and knew immediately that I had applied Fake Bake after an entire bottle of pinot grigio because the guide was streaked down the right side of my face and right leg. Luckily, however, I just rubbed the guide off, nursed my hangover, and made a plan to fake tan again tonight. Love Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and this is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t smell bad or make me look orange</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great...at first. As the day wore on it developed that same old self-tanner smell (maybe it is just a &#x27;skin-turning-darker&#x27; smell?). Also it pretty much washed off in the shower, which I took 14 hours after I applied it. It is a good product and went on very easily, no streaks, and not orange at all. I will continue to use it. I didn&#x27;t want to put it on at night as suggested because I have white bedding.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a few years now, and I always get compliments on my tan.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends who use it loyally now as well.  Great color, easy application.  Everything you&#x27;d want in a sunless tan.</li>
            <li> At first, it made my skin look beautiful. It wasn&#x27;t the least bit orange, but after a week and a half, it started to fade and made me look like a brown and white Dalmatian. I followed the instructions perfectly also. Lets just say I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> After using other fake bake products I thought I would love a deeper color. Some reason it was great until I got to my chest. The applicator would not make any difference in color and even when I washed everything off I still had an obvious blotchy tan line from the chest up with the occasional patch of bronze. I was wearing no lotions and had just exfoliated before.</li>
            <li> Leaves streaks and the application process is just not that user friendly.  You get what you pay for !! Not happy...</li>
            <li> As good as home-self-applied fake-tanner can be... Mitt clogs and wears before the product is gone, though, and it&#x27;s kind of necessary...</li>
            <li> It really does give u a glow! It doesn&#x27;t give u a deep tan more of a bronze color. But it&#x27;s perfect the scent is not bad and u can literally put it on in the morning and go about your day! It dries super fast!! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is as it fades u do get blotchy in the elbow crease. I haven&#x27;t found 1 that doesn&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Only stuff that gives my PALE self a natural non-orange color.</li>
            <li> Loved it but kinda left my legs dry.used lotion but still flaked a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product just wish it would come with two application mits because the first one gets a little bit nasty by the end of the bottle</li>
            <li> Wonderful long lasting colors and will be purchasing it for now on. I get compliments on my complexion now !</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to apply and smells realitively good for self tanner. Tan stays about 3 days.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and when you wash if off the next day, there is no glow. Waste of time. I recommend Jergens natural glow</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use often, but it&#x27;s nice for a special occasion. Also got some for my daughter, commented on her tan, she said that&#x27;s the stuff you got me! I figured she had been to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than lotion type, looks natural.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells like tropical bliss and absolutely none of that gross self tanner smell. Goes on so easy without hassle, absorbs quickly, and without steaks of any kind. Looks natural and is a beautiful bronze, and the results are instant. If your concerned about it being a spray, you&#x27;re not alone because so was I. But these guys nailed it!!! This product deserves more than 5 stars!!! Buy it!! You won&#x27;t regret it!!! And what&#x27;s even better is they&#x27;re cruelty free!! No animal testing!! What could be better!?!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best self tanner I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty smell (I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most self tanners) it does have a tiny bit of smell but not that bad. This the product left best color i have ever had from self tanner! I tan very easily but need a little help in the spring and on my legs in general, no weird orange/yellow color, just beautiful brown!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Iam all about tanning! This stuff is GREAT!</li>
            <li> What can I say that no one else has? I did a lot of research before I bought this stuff and I honestly could not find one bad review and I see why.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff, fool proof and EXTREMELY NATURAL LOOKING.  I get VERY FAIR,  almost white in the winter; but in the summer, I am capable of getting a nice medium deep tan.  This stuff works from the dead of winter on my fair skin, to a touch up in the middle of the summer to cover bikini lines or even the natural tan from the sun that I have. And this is my FIRST TIME USING FAKE TANNER, I was always afraid of looking like an Oompa Loompa!  But this is seriously foolproof and will give even the fairest skin tones a chance to feel like a golden goddess!  Don&#x27;t think another second, BUT IT.</li>
            <li> Works great at first then doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> I love the spray in the tan can that this brand has. its one was ok for my legs</li>
            <li> Really like it! It doesn&#x27;t make me orange and looks like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan!</li>
            <li> I admit that I have a serious tanning addiction and since I am trying to stop years of destruction done to my face &amp; body from tanning beds &amp; beach days, a friend suggested I try this and it is perfect. No oompa loopa colored skin (or clothes). Just take your time when applying!</li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with this product. The tan seems to be uneven, washes off and stains my clothes. I do like the color it provides and if I decide to give up showering and buy tan colored clothes I may use again.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be really popular so I had to have it. It does work good and I do like it but the only issue with it is I wish it would last longer. It seems as if it washes right off but other then that its a great product. The best self tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and got a nice base tan instantly. I slept with it on overnight, only a little bit rinsed off but left no streaks just a nice tan. I have to try it on my face because I have acne prone skin but I didn&#x27;t make it so its a huge difference in color but enough to wear dresses and short sleeve shirts and have some color. Will be a nice collection to have when I start accutane and can&#x27;t use tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for $30 at a salon and loved it. Found it on Amazon for $14. I get compliments every day on my tan, everyone asks me if I have been to the beach or tanning bed. It is the most natural looking tan you can get in a bottle and the easiest to apply. I have very sensitive skin and so far have not had any problems. At least 10 of my friends have bought the Fake Bake after seeing me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.. I&#x27;ve tanned and spray tanned for about 4 years now and the color I get with Fake Bake is so much nicer than the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it is my favorite self-tanner the mit offers a great application</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the mint and color. Still cannot perfect the streak free look but it is a golden Brown and not Orange so I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just had to post a review as this product is the very best self tanner I&#x27;ve EVER used. I live in Florida but haven&#x27;t been out in the sun for the past 6months (winter) ...  after applying this self tanner (as per the instructions) I couldn&#x27;t believe how my instant tan looked SO REAL ! I would highly recommend this product!!! At least try it, it&#x27;s amazing! Thank you Fab Projects!!!</li>
            <li> I am about as experienced with sunless tanners as a consumer could be. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and I know all the techniques -- and this one threw me for a loop. The color is nice, the smell is nice, but Fake Bake &amp;#34;Flawless,&amp;#34; it seems, is inherently flawed:&lt;br /&gt;A) If you have even a hint of any sort of other product on your skin -- lotion, makeup, deodorant, deodorant that wasn&#x27;t scoured off with a freakin&#x27; loofah -- then it will turn that area green and it will stain the pad and turn anything else it touches green, too. And for those of you who are accustomed to applying lotion to your rough spots (knees, elbows, feet, etc.) prior to applying tanner...DON&#x27;T. It will turn those spots green too.&lt;br /&gt;B) You are supposed to apply it at night. Why? Because it turns you the color of a sunburned Oompa Loompa.&lt;br /&gt;C) Another reason you are supposed to apply it at night: Because if you sweat, the &amp;#34;color guide&amp;#34; will run and you will end up with a patch of white, untanned skin wherever you sweat or wherever skin touches skin. And herein lies the rub – no pun intended: for anyone who&#x27;s body is not perfectly made for this product (i.e. if you have anything but A-cup boobs and tiny thighs), you will likely sweat -- even just a tad -- at night while you sleep and you will likely have skin-on-skin contacts in different spots. You will therefore awake with white patches between and under your boobs, between your thighs and around your bikini line. I weigh 107 lbs so I&#x27;m thinking you must have to be anorexic or something for this stuff to work and even then you must have to sleep splayed out, on your back all night so as to keep your legs from touching each other, etc.&lt;br /&gt;......Upon using this a few times and assuming I was doing it wrong, I called the company and had the misfortune I&#x27;ve been speaking to an irreverent, unapologetic little snot who verified that sweat, lotion, and skin-on-skin contact would, indeed, cause this product not to work and sheoffered no tips, tricks, or hints that might help me, otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had bad luck with it.  Made me look blotchy and permanently stained some of my skin on my legs.  My cousin loves it so it is probably just me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely pale and never been able to tan.  I burn, peel and turn white again :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked the tanning lotions because they left me orange and streaky, but no more!  This stuff is&lt;br /&gt;awesome, however if you have age spots... like me, then you will see them pop out.  I have discovered though that by dabbing a mixture of Glycerine and lemon juice on them it helps to fade them.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless leaks ... ALOT. After 3-4 pumps, the liquid leaked large, brown splotches everywhere - it&#x27;s a good thing I was spraying the mitt over the sink. It continued to leak every time I pumped, and made a gawd-awful mess. I snipped the end off the pump tube, as another reviewer recommended, so that&#x27;s not the issue. It seems to be leaking right out of the nozzle itself - the little hole the product comes out of. When I finished applying, I rinsed the bottle off under the faucet, to get rid of the product that was smeared all over it. I then noticed a place on the back of my leg I wanted to touch up, so I pumped onto the mitt and pale brown, highly diluted product came out of the nozzle. Wherever the leak is coming from, it&#x27;s large enough for water to flow *into* it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond this, all I can say is it&#x27;s \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it requires a heck of a lot of work for the color your skin turns.  \\&quot;The juice is not worth the squeeze.\\&quot;  Will not purchase again. - there are many products out there which achieve the same result with less effort - and no mess.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have no problems using the mitt with it. I&#x27;m a stay @ home mom, in my early 30&#x27;s with kids. This is fantastic to use for an event, night out, wedding, etc. I don&#x27;t use it all the time. But its really nice to use when I need it. I have another Fake Bake product that is in a gold can. Its a finer mist type. I think it does give you more of a brown color than this does. This for me is more brown/bronze color. But not umpa lumpa orange.I don&#x27;t have the time or money to spray tan at salons. Although I have done that, id say this is about 75% comparable. I wouldn&#x27;t probably do this for my own wedding, but just to go out...its great! I use it a lot in spring &amp; fall..for in between colors. I&#x27;m Caucasian, I get ghostly in winter, but tan well in summer. I put this on after a shower around 5-6pm. I wear loose clothing afterwards, I do notice some rub off but it washes out. And I will notice it on the sheets, but no stains. I use this on say a wed night, again, thurs night, for a Friday or Saturday event. I do need about 2 rounds of it. But that&#x27;s more than plenty dark for me. If you do professionally spray tan this would be nice to use to extend the tan a little longer, sort of like maintaining it. I shower before using, and I use a Cure Series Japanese Bath towel (blue) to exfoliate prior. Works great!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless looks very natural and good for the first 1-2 days. The problem is that even if you follow all instructions it still seems to wear off very fast. I think this needs applied more than one time per week which makes it hard to do if you lack the time. Otherwise just based on color I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It does make you dark but I just don&#x27;t like how it goes on, I think I like the lotions better.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST self tanning product I have ever used.  And, I have used many, many.  The color developed into a natural looking, dark brown, beautiful color that  lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> LOVE this has a nice natural color, if you have fair skin do  NOT use too often youll be bronze like SNOOOOKIII but other wise I looooveee this Sooooo much going to buy ALOTTT Moreeeeeee !(:</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the only thing I dislike is the glove you put it on with.  It twists on my hand and makes it difficult to get it all over my body.  Other than that though I love it and it works fast and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a spray on tan expert, but this worked great for me all winter! I used the entire bottle and would do it again! I followed the instructions and it was great! I had several people comment on my tan that it was natural! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> No fake tanner looks like a real tan, but this is by far the closest you can get.  Doesn&#x27;t have that fake tanner stench, no streaks, easy to use, and good color.</li>
            <li> GreAt product and fast shipping! Love the price and the look the product gives. I also do suggest cutting the spray straw a bit so the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak. But overall really good! Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanning product i&#x27;ve ever used, and I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ll never use another self tanner! it comes with latex gloves and a mitt, it&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.  I bought it as a requested gift for my daughter.  She sent me a link and request...I bought it.</li>
            <li> All the sunless tanning product i used - after applying to the skin , i have to wait at least 30 min till it dries on the skin. This product is different - you are actually getting nice brown tan right away after applying ! No waiting time! The color on the skin looks pretty natural. Really like the mitten-is very soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast too.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> It was great!! It was very fast and easy!  It creates a beautiful color and smells great!  I would recommend this product to others. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s literally the only fake tanner that doesn&#x27;t look fake. I just wish I could find somewhere to buy the application mitts for cheap because they start to fall apart after a little while.</li>
            <li> This product starts working as soon as you apply. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how is starts to smudge off. You really cant reapply with the same coverage as the initial application because as you wash it and as the days do by it wears harder in certain areas than others. My arms for example had weird marks where it started wearing off at and then when I reapplied those were lighter than the rest. Good smell though...good smell.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used..ever!! The color is a gorgeous brown instead of orangey like spray tans usually come out. I am so happy to have found this spray and one of the best parts about it is the mitt that comes with it. Best thing ever!! It leaves no streaks at all and stays on for a considerable amount of time. I will use this self tanner for as long as I want to be tan :D&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much fake bake!!</li>
            <li> I saw this on you tube. was looking for help darkening  my legs, they are hard to get tan!  so I couldn&#x27;t wait to order, and when I go it , tried, I think its amazing , and fast, not messy at all.  everyone compliments my natural tan look...but its my secret!!!</li>
            <li> nice tan after one application</li>
            <li> Wow, I just used this for the first time and love it!! The smell is actually pleasant! It smells tropical. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena, Loreal and Jergens self tanning products forever but didn&#x27;t like the smell of any of them. Also I felt less sticky after the application. And love that it is tinted so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it. I came downstairs and my 6 year old son said, you look amazing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it! Goes on so well, no splotchy marks would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with the mitt.</li>
            <li> Well for the first time ever and I didn&#x27;t think it was possible. There is no scent  to this..none. no gross &amp;#34; we know you have self tanner on&amp;#34; smell what so ever. It&#x27;s dark, so be prepared for that. It&#x27;s the same color I got from the salon self tanner, no weird orange color but can be streaky until you get the hang of it. I suggest light strokes and maybe a new pad because the pad keeps flying off my hands. Other than that That I love it, not sure about winter, it will look quite dark over such non tanned skin and will be way too obvious but if you have somewhat of a light tan or any hint of being in the sun, you will be fine. I still cannot believe it has no scent and it dries immediately. I took my gloves off and lightly went over my hands. Worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Works great the first 5 times, washes off when you take a shower though, no real lasting effect and the effectiveness of it seemed to go down after using it more and more.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST , most natural, tanned look, I have ever used. No orange tint. I will no longer use anything but Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried.  This stuff dries very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have that nasty smell other sunless tanners always get, even after a few hours (as others sometimes develop or have right away).  As long as you wear the gloves and apply with the mitt, this goes on nicely and gives a great natural looking tan. You don&#x27;t feel sticky afterward, and you don&#x27;t have to wait around naked for it to dry.  I showered, exfoliated with shower gloves, and then applied to dry skin.  I then washed my mitt to make it last a little longer, but I do think I will end up having to buy another because I can&#x27;t see it lasting for a real long time. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> what a mess. it&#x27;s a stain, leaked all over destroying a nice 32.00 shirt. won,t apply evenly for me anyway.captez</li>
            <li> Great product. My favorite sunless tanner. The mit is great. No mess</li>
            <li> I have bought this product Several times! Love it and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best self tanning product I have ever tried and SO inexpensive! Trust me, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many tanners but this one is the last I&#x27;ll ever use.  Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on streak free&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell&lt;br /&gt; - Goes on with a dry feel and does not rub off&lt;br /&gt; - Fades evenly (Some I&#x27;ve used get blotchy when they start to fade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The mitt should have a thumb.  It wants to slip off during application.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I was feeling a little washed-out so I got this to spruce up my tan and wow! Instant tan.  Take a before pic of your legs then apply the product and take an after, you can visibly notice the difference- that is a good product for me! Note: it WILL stain any skin it comes into contact to so be vigilant about wearing the gloves and mitt! ;) I love that it is a safe alternative to tanning in beds during the off-season, b/c I always feel really guilty about doing so.  I would def. recommend this product !</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to darken her Asian brown skin a bit for a wedding.  She looked pretty good after one application.  After two she looked a bit orange.  The orange color is much more apparent in the wedding pictures than is visible by the eye.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying more than one time every week or so.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking with no orange color. Only reason it lost a star was it has to be used or thrown away within 10 days after opening.</li>
            <li> It works, it really works...beautiful tan, no orange...use it especially when going to doctor for check ups.  Makes one look like just returning from island holiday.</li>
            <li> The absolute best tanning product hands down. I use this in conjunction with the Jergens tanning lotion. It makes me skin look very tan and healthy! Pick up a bottle today. Put it on in the morning, let it dry before you put on your clothes. Then just make sure you shower before bed!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I think this is my favorite self tanners. I bought the 60 second one and I dont think it is nearly as good as this one is. Good light color but it is noticable and it goes on very even!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SELF TANNER!! I personally think this is the easiest self tanner out there. I&#x27;m medium skin tone with yellow undertones (MAC NC 37) and after two applications I look like I just came back from the beach (MAC NC 42ish). The application is so easy and it&#x27;s goof proof. I have never looked streaky after this self tanner. I guess always remember to blend the tanner in circular motions. Also, I was a bit addicted to this tanner and applied it 4 days in a row...well I looked a bit unnatural. So I recommend tanning 2-3 days in the row and then letting it fade and applying again.</li>
            <li> It actually works, looks great with no streaking. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the professional spray....but it saves money and time! Easy to apply, especially with the included mitt, literally takes 5 minutes out of your day. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other users are talking about when their skin turns green. I was hesitant to wear lotion or perfume because of those reviews but the spray is just too dark. I had to put lotion on to dilute it and keep it even on my skin (even after smoothing out with the glove). The glove does turn green though after a few uses but I didn&#x27;t notice any rub-off. It darkens super fast, is relatively easy to put on but the sprayer nozzle will sometimes leak so I have to put a crappy towel down to prevent it getting on my floors or spray my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good. P.S. I don&#x27;t do tanning booths, I was in the middle of my finals for my Ph.D. for several months during the summer and my skin hadn&#x27;t seen the light of day for months so I used this to help get rid of my white glow.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell is so yummy like coconuts, I apply it right before bed and I absoutely dont mind the smell hours later either. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my legs before work and I&#x27;ve gotten LOADS of compliments on my tan! Tee-hee...little to they know it&#x27;s FAKE BAKE! ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can express how much I love this self tanner. I&#x27;ve tried so many different tanners that have left me streaky, smelly, and orange. Well, hallelujah, I have finally found my miracle product! This spray goes on so easy! The whole-body application process takes me less than 10 minutes, and I always end up with flawless results. One of my favorite things about this tanner (besides the super yummy smell) is the dying time. There isn&#x27;t one. Seriously. I can get dressed immediately, as this spray dries instantly. I really like that it has an instant bronzer (that acts as an indicator) so you can tell where you&#x27;ve put the product on. This is my holy grail product for life. Can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is. I&#x27;d pay over $100 for a product this good.</li>
            <li> Was pretty pleased overall with this product.  My only real complaint is with the applicator glove.  The tanner soaks through by the time you get done with your whole body, so you still end up with tanner to wash off your palms/fingers, which defeats the purpose of having a glove!  The inside needs to be plastic or some other non-porous material.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every self tanner there is and this is by far my favorite.  I am very pale and this does not turn my skin orange.  If you follow the directions, you will not look streaky.  I do recommend putting lotion on your hands and feet (especially under your feet and on your toes) to help keep them from splotching.  The reviews I read on this before buying it were very accurate.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!!</li>
            <li> I have had some sort of tan for thirty years.  I have baked in the sun, roasted in tanning beds,and slathered on at least fifty self-tanners during that time period.  This Is, by far, the best sunless tanner that I have ever used.  I think it looks better than my tanning bed tan.  The product is easy to apply and dries fast.the best part is that you wash it off after 60 minutes, which means your bedding doesn&#x27;t turn brown!  Great product!  I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to find this product !  I love it !  Smells fine, lasts long enough.  I use it every weekend and it lasts until mid week. NIce color.</li>
            <li> It truly is flawless.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!! It gives such a nice tan to your skin. Like a lot of tanning lotions that make you orange, not this one! I would recommend to get the tanning stuff that is actually for you face, because with this stuff it made me break out a little bit; although I have not bought the stuff that is actually for my face. Otherwise, I seriously cannot get enough of this. I love love love love love love it! :D</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used for tanning sprays and this one is the best! Love love it!</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this with high hopes. I WANT to like it. I will say that it has a nice brownish color and does not make you orange.&lt;br /&gt;I followed all of the directions perfectly, and it did go on nice and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this is the fact that it all washes off when you shower. I also cannot get past the smell. That awful sunless tanner smell kicks in about 2 hours after applying.</li>
            <li> Great tan and is easily applied.  I have used other products in the past and love this one.  I did not turn orange or streak.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, we all feel better and look better with a little color to our skin! I think I&#x27;ve tried every sunless tanner on the shelves through the years. I&#x27;m a firm believer in skin protection while still having a nice sunkissed glow so I&#x27;m not one to use tanning beds or go out into the sun without sunscreen on. I also have a few tattoos that I care to keep looking nice, especially because I&#x27;ve invested so much money into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought everything from cheap lotion to expensive gels and even used aerosol spray tanners and gotten Mystic Tans. I was looking for an alternative to the sticky feeling of a lotion/gel and something that *hopefully* wouldn&#x27;t have that stinky sunless tanner smell that instantly screams &amp;#34;I USE SUNLESS TANNER&amp;#34; to everyone standing within a &amp;#34;sniffing&amp;#34; distance from you. I read numerous reviews for different products and decided that Fake Bake Flawless was worth trying. I read reviews that said the bottle leaked when using the spray pump and it was suggested to cut the pump tube down a little bit so it fits into the bottle. I did this as soon as I received the product and the bottle didn&#x27;t leak at all during my first application last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After exfoliating in the shower really well (use a shower gel that has beads or granules in it to help remove dead skin) and shaving, I got out of the shower and dried off. I then put a light coat of lotion on my knees, ankles, tops and sides of both feet, wrists (inner and outer), elbows (inner and outer) and around my armpits. I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with sunless tanner streaking or looking muddy in those areas. After the lotion soaked in I put on the latex gloves that come with the kit, then put on the microfiber mit. The directions say to spray the mitt with the sunless tanner and then apply but I found that the mit absorbs a lot of it before it reaches your skin, so it&#x27;s easiest to spray it directly onto your skin instead and then rub it in from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE TO LAY A TOWEL DOWN WHERE YOU WILL BE DOING THE SUNLESS TANNING. No matter how close to your skin you get with the bottle, some mist will get onto the floor or rug and if you don&#x27;t wipe it up quick enough, it might leave a slight stain. I did this in my bathroom and just put an old bath towel down on the floor. I started with my legs and sprayed a few sprays up and down the front, back, and sides of my legs. With the microfiber mit I worked the liquid into my skin by using a circular motion and sparingly spreading it down over to the tops and sides of my feet. I used a patting/dabbing technique to apply a small amount of liquid to my hands and feet and it seemed to work great. I then did my torso, rear end, back, chest, and then finished with my shoulders/shoulder blades, neck (blending it up to under my chin), and arms (front and back). I chose not to use it on my face since I have a lotion-based sunless tanner designed specifically for faces that I use. The mit is very soft and easy to use, but beware--I had some fuzzies come off and get onto my skin. I think this is just because it&#x27;s the first time I used it. As a side note: make sure to wash your mit out with warm water and soap after you use it. I threw mine in the dryer on high heat for about 10 minutes and it came out clean and fuzz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid rubs on smoothly and due to its chocolate color, you can tell exactly where you&#x27;ve already applied it. It has a great coconut smell and dries quickly so you&#x27;re not standing around waiting for it to soak in and feeling sticky. I put my pajamas on shortly after applying Fake Bake and my skin felt soft and had instant color. I went to bed and slept comfortably throughout the night and in the morning there were no stains on my sheets. My skin looks fabulous and I have a Bahamas-esque tan that isn&#x27;t orange or fake looking in the least! No streaking, blotching, or uneven areas to be found. The best part? NO SUNLESS TANNER SMELL! It never oncesmelled like the typical sunless tanners (I liken it to rotten fruit), instead the pleasant coconut smell went away throughout the night and I was left with a great tan and no smell whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s easy to use (only took me about 8 minutes total to apply) and the results are like nothing I&#x27;ve ever gotten before from other sunless tanners. If you&#x27;re hesitant about trying a non-lotion tanner like I was, this is well worth the chance. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan on using it much more in the future, especially as the weather gets warmer :)</li>
            <li> i have used ever tanning thing on the market, and this is the absolute best.  my second favorite it the neutrogena micromist in &#x27;dark&#x27;, but it just isnt quite dark enough for me.  fake bake goes on easily and smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  it&#x27;s easy to see where you apply it because the colorguard is super dark.  SMLx0 on youtube reviewed this and that&#x27;s why i bought it, i recommend going to find her video if you&#x27;re interested in it.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time yesterday and I love it. Looks very natural, not orange at all. Easy to apply, even on my face. Got lots of compliments. I had 100+ stitches in my face from melanoma and this absorbed nicely into my scar without making it more noticeable!!  Definitely recommend!!  Only Con:  keeping the Mir in was a little difficult but not impossible.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star only because i have found that after about 2 showers it seams to be almost gone. It goes on great, gives you a wonderfu tan, no orange color, no streeks, very nice tanning lotion. Just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle on my bottle of Fake Bake was faulty (needless to say that was a mess trying to use it the first time) however, I replaced it with a clean spray nozzle from a half empty body spray which worked wonderfully. I love how easily it goes on and love the color. Unfortunately, most of the color washed away with one shower. (And I did not use any body wash or lotion with ingredients that may cause the sunless tanner not to absorbe) I have found I like using this sunless tanner best a few days after a spray tan to make it last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I am one of the whitest girls my friends know. And I&#x27;ve always had pale skin, but this tanner gives me that perfect bronze glow. The first time I applied it I was a little splotchy but second time I figured it out and it&#x27;s perfect! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The glove makes for perfect coverage, no creases or dark spots. I would recommend spraying on the glove first not yourself though. Besides that wonderful! The color is natural and golden looking and does increase with time and applications.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good results, quick dry, no fuss, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this baby! Its a holy grail product year round!</li>
            <li> Love it! Always goes on flawlessly. I&#x27;m a very fair skinned person and embarrassed to wear shorts or a skirt, this gives me the confidence. I&#x27;ve heard people say the application mitt gets worn, yes I suppose it does if you use the stuff, but wash it out, place it over the bottle to dry, it&#x27;s good to go for the next time. When you reorder (and you will if you love it like I do) you will get a brand new mitt!! The tube for the spray nozzle is a bit too long, just cut it off!!! And when you get your new bottle, switch the nozzles to the new bottle or cut the extra off on the new bottle. I had a bit left in the old bottle too, so I used some in the new and poured the rest from the old bottle into the new one. :)&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes spray directly on my body and then rub it in with the mitt. Sometimes I spray onto the mitt and rub into those hard to spray spots. When done, I have a go at my face with what&#x27;s left on the mitt.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a fake tan product. Great product. Works perfectly. Just make sure to shave and exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li> Great self-tanner. Good color, no streaks, the smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> Fantastic self-tanner! I tried the Fake Bake Flawless Darker after I finished my first bottle of this one, and I actually like the Darker better for my skin tone. But this company is definitely the best I&#x27;ve found out of many, many, many self-tanning products.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes with a mitt that makes the application a piece of cake. The color is very natural for my skin tone, dries quick, not sticky, no streaks, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I&#x27;ll definitely be using it again and again!</li>
            <li> I did everything exactly as instructed, and the application was just fine... BUT the color is awful! I felt like I was one of those people who tan so much they look orange!</li>
            <li> I have never really been able to use a self tanner due to my skin being dry, but this stuff is outstanding!! I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Being as ghostly white as I am I was super nervous to try this. I had nightmares of looking like an Oompa Loompa. I tried it on a Friday night so it had time to fade before work on Monday if it was bad. To my joyous surprise it was orange at all! It looks you spent the day at the beach. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Simply love this fake tanner.</li>
            <li> I have never used a liquid tanner before, I have always used the tanning bed to get the tan I wanted. Boy have I been missing out. This product is very good and exceeded my expectations. It isnt orange looking like I thought they all were, it gave me a nice brown tan instantly. If only I would have tried this sooner. I would recommend this product to everyone I know, save yourself the possibility of skin cancer with constant tanning and go with this. One last thing I have a medium olive skin tone so not sure how it would work on a paler person. Though I assume it would look good.</li>
            <li> Turned me orange. Would not recommend or buy again!!!! Wasted my money on this. I noticed it while I was arround a lot of people and was so embarressed.</li>
            <li> Great product. You must exfoliate and put a moisturizing cream BEFORE you apply, and this does stain clothes so you&#x27;d have to wait a while before you put your clothes on. It&#x27;s preferable if you sleep with the tan so that the color can penetrate your skin more effectively. but its pretty good. It does have a strange scent that makes me feel like I haven&#x27;t showered in days, even though I showered hours before. But that&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo great! Ive tried all kinds of lotions that were suppose to give you a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking tan, including the expensive spray tan at the salon, even tanning beds that I knew were causing damage to my skin. Fake Bake is just as good as the salon spray tan except waaay better on my pocket book and easy to apply at home. Does not turn you orange and you can even apply to your face. I&#x27;m addicted and will more than likely try out their other product as well!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am a fair, blond, blue eyed woman with the whitest legs you have ever seen.  I have tried a lot self tanners.  Only to have that orange fake tone.  I really have to use something on my legs in the summer so I can wear capri pants and skirts without hose.  I was going to the beach and did not know how I was going to wear a bathing suit with chubby shocking white thighs. I received fake bake before I left for the beach.  I used it before leaving and I really looked like I had a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;So at the beach my husband and I would slather sun screen all over us before going to the beach and then sit under an umbrella all day.  We would shower and put fake bake flawless all over us before going out to dinner.(I know you are supposed to go to bed- so what - we went out to dinner instead.)  We looked like beach bums.  My hair looked blonder, my teeth looked whiter, my eyes looked bluer.  We thought we looked pretty hot.  I love this stuff.  I did cut the tube before using to avoid leaking.&lt;br /&gt;When we came back to work we kept the tan up for a while and everyone thought we had real tans from baking on the beach.  (I don&#x27;t tan, I burn!) I am now just using it on my legs.  I threw out all the other junk self tanners in my cabinet.  I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> The reason this item is getting two stars is because the item I received wasn&#x27;t what it was supposed to be. This was a watered down version of what I have used in the past, and love! I would typically SWEAR by this product. I LOVE the color it gives me. The fact that it was so watered down resulted in a unexpected spill  ALL over the floor (ran right off the mitt) . This ended up getting into my grout so what was supposed to take 15-20 mins, turned into over an hour because I had to scrub my floors. If this item was not watered down it would get 5 stars. Next time I will just go back and pay the $10 extra at Ulta to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> This selftanner is fantastic. As a frequent Xen-Tan dark lotion user I am converted to Fake Bake! The application with the mitt and color guide is easy. The product is dry within a few seconds so you can get dressed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing: it does not smell like selftan at all! It smells very tropical. Will buy more and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very natural looking tan - doesn&#x27;t make you look orange (i&#x27;m fair-skinned and it looks very natural on me)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great - coconut/tropical scent (after a few hours you do start to smell a bit of the classic \\&quot; fake tanner smell\\&quot;, but barely noticeable)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply - love the mitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last very long, need to apply about every 2 days&lt;br /&gt;Color isn&#x27;t very dark (I guess this could be a pro in some cases)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this self tanner.  I will try others though.  I&#x27;m just not sure I want to be applying it every other day.  If I can&#x27;t find anything that I like better, I will go back to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used Jergens tanning cream for two summers now and I had always thought it was pretty decent, even though it was the first tanning cream I used I always stuck with it. It would take maybe 4 days of application to really see a change but I thought that would be the same for any tanning product. Also I found that one tube would only last about 8 applications. So I would constantly be buying tubes and tubes that were 8-10 each. So finally I decided to try this product just for fun, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I was so worried about having streaks or looking orange. But I put it on once and woke up and my skin was already a few shades darker. It evened out my blotchy paleness and made my skin in general look so much better. By night two of it I was already at my desired tanness. It took two days to achieve what Jergens took about 4. Also I had no streaking or any fake looking areas around my elbows and knees. This product lasts a week without applying more before I start to see it fading in certain areas by my inner arm. It looks really patchy and bad if you let it get to that point. So it&#x27;s best to keep applying so it doesn&#x27;t get patchy. Lastly the smell of this product is AMAZING!! It&#x27;s like a tropical smell as its so good I wish I had it in a perfume!! I totally reccomend this product and it got me through a whole summer with just ONE BOTTLE! Big money saver and great results!</li>
            <li> This product is  awesome! It goes on effortlessly with the mitt...and Never streaky and just natural color results . I&#x27;m hooked on this product ,all the  other self tanners are history! Now that I&#x27;ve tried fake bake flawless!</li>
            <li> After trying several self-tanners, this is by far, the most tolerable. The application is easy, it dries really fast &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the hideous smell afterwards. The end result is great, until 2-3 days later. The tanner begins to fade &amp; leaves your skin looking blotchy. You need to exfoliate really well to get it all off. I like the product &amp; the color, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not orangy, looks natural and not stinky.  Perfect tan, without the skin damage! My go to tanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a pretty large amount of self tanners, and this one and Sungoddess are the only two i will use! I prefer the Fake Bake Flawless over the Sungoddess because Sungoddess seems to dry/bunch up when i&#x27;m applying in some areas, but other then that if i&#x27;m careful and rub in good then no problems. Color is GREAT ! A nice bronze tan, not orange. Yuck. I typically go to the tanning bed but it has been a bit pricey lately and the self tanners are also a better alternative for your skin. Big YES from me, i would recommend to anyone looking for a nice healthy tan without the damage of a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Should have noticed it right away by the bottle that this wasn&#x27;t a continuous spray which makes a lot of spotted and blotched areas on the body; which I understand thats what the mitten is for. In fact, it makes for a very nice deep tan (no orange) if you are willing to devote the time. I find myself correcting areas constantly with this tanner, which makes me use more of the product; meaning it will run out soon which is also displeasing. If you want to save time and money I suggest a JWOWW spray tanner, I used it before this product. Just a shower, continuous spray, and dry. Voila nice tan. Or you could buy this and rub in bloches for an hour trying to get an even tone.</li>
            <li> would buy again its just as the picture and description and cheaper than buying at Sephora or other beauty stores thanks A+++</li>
            <li> This product definitely leaves your skin with a beautiful, warm color. There is no orange tint to it at all, it smells nice, and it is generally easy to apply. Definitely one of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve tried. However, I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t exfoliate enough or my skin was too dry, but fake bake left some parts of my skin pretty blotchy. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and gave it a chance because the color is very nice, but it just didn&#x27;t sit well on top of my skin. I would recommend this product to a friend, but only if they weren&#x27;t willing to spend the extra $20 for the St. Tropez tanner, which I believe is definitely superior.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s not easy to smear it or leave lines and the color does not appear orange as some products do.  I have a friend who is VERY fair skinned that it looks a little orange if she is in a hurry, but over all I love this product.  It&#x27;s not recommended, but I use it even on my face.</li>
            <li> Great color, easy application. Great product</li>
            <li> If used exactly as directed, this is certainly one of the better self tanning products I have attempted.  And there have been many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The applicator sponge is a real pain to use, unless you are doing large area&#x27;s or your whole body, but for my face, I just don&#x27;t like it. Guys need to shave and exfoliate for best results. I found this works just as well if you use a paper towel folded twice, spray some water on the towel to moisten, then some lotion, then apply by rubbing on. No need to shave or scrub your skin. The diluted lotion goes on even, you just have to use it more often. I just use it on my face to hide mild Rosacea every 3 days</li>
            <li> This product was really great especially in the beginning. As the bottle emptied the rubbing into my skin became less noticeable and took more sprays. But still great product</li>
            <li> Best at home tanner I have found. It does not turn you orange and doesn&#x27;t streak. Comes with a nice mitt and is easy to see where you put it on at.</li>
            <li> Love this! Very fast and easy to use. I wish the tan lasted longer but it is still great. The tan doesn&#x27;t streak you even when it wears off it is very natural looking.</li>

            <li> This is the first time I have bought a self tanner and I read so many reviews on it and can now add to those and say how easy it is to apply and the color is so natural looking. Perfect for winter and keeping a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  It is the best most effective self tanner i have ever tried.  I am verrrrrrry sensitive to smell and almost everything gives me a headache.  I put this on my face at night, before bed, and the smell is nice--it is almost like a coconut scent.  I was it off in the morning and it give me a nice tan.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided on this fake tanner. I am overall pleased with the product, but I did expect it to be better. This DOES rub off on your clothes, so I would advise to shower after it has had time to set in the next day. It didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I expected it to either. I expected at least a week to appear tanned but really within a few days it was completely faded, even after applying 3 consecutive days. From the reviews, I did expect more, but it does serve it&#x27;s purpose and is a good product but I am not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I looked into buying this product for a while. I watched youtube videos and read a lot of the reviews just to make sure it was going to be a good self tanner and worth my money. This product arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! I took a shower and made sure to exfoliate very well, got out (dried off, etc.) and applied the self tanner as the directions had said. The first arm I did looked fine. then I did my chest and it was splotchy and there were streaks and no matter what I did the streaks wouldn&#x27;t go away. I figured I&#x27;d just apply more when it was dry and see if it would even out. I finished everything except for my face. My legs looked okay.. there weren&#x27;t as many streaks on them as there was my arms. I lastly applied it to my face which DID NOT go well. It made my face orange and brown and splotchy. Very gross looking. I ended up having to get in the shower and scrub the tanner off with lemons and salt in order to get it off. The tanner smells very good and I like the look and idea of it but all in all I&#x27;m very disappointed because I thought that this was going to be a great self tanner. Since this item can&#x27;t be returned I am willing to try it again.. I&#x27;m not sure when. If it goes any differently I will make sure to update my review.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the simple fact that it tans you instantly and does not rub off on your clothes. You can wear white right after you have applied this and not worry about it turning your clothes brown like other products.  It can streak your skin if you are not careful though.</li>
            <li> This product is super legit! It&#x27;s an awesome price for amazing results. I have olive complexion with yellow undertone and this spray just gives me the most golden bronze natural looking tan. It&#x27;s easy to apply, dries fast, and smells like coconuts. I will definitely be repurchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> This is not my first fake tanner-  but by far the best. I&#x27;ve tried sunlabs due to all the hype and hated it.&lt;br /&gt;Fake bake flawless is so easy to apply, and fades completely even.&lt;br /&gt;There is no mess, no horrible odor and it dries so fast!&lt;br /&gt;I never expected a sunless tanner to be so convenient</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this bc all the reviews and youtube videos Idk if its bc I&#x27;m like Powder white so what but it barely gave me a tan and I put it on 2 days in a row. I&#x27;m hoping that if I keep using it eventually a tan will appear I hope I didnt waste my money. Now before someone says something about me not exfoliating be sure I did I made my own with sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, sea salt and some vanilla extract (I smelled like a cookie and it was fab! I was so smooth but anywho) So ya I did that I dried off completely and then rubbed it in blending etc slept in it and then in the morning showered rinsing the color guide off. and i only had a hint like a barely there hint of color so I repeated it the same day at night again</li>
            <li> Gents,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I was as apprehensive as you, should guys try this stuff? The answer is an easy yes. Let me begin by saying, I&#x27;m pretty pale, especially in the winter. I&#x27;m planning on going to Florida soon, and didn&#x27;t want to blind people with my paleness. I considered hitting a tanning bed but that would conflict with my healthy lifestyle and they just don&#x27;t work for me. So i perused the internet and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were only female reviewers so I wasn&#x27;t sure. i went ahead and ordered it, and it works exactly how I wanted it to. No one has walked up to me and noticed that I became extremely tan in a day, that would be unnatural. It works by gradually bringing you to the level you want through multiple applications (and there&#x27;s plenty left over after multiple applications), It looks natural too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I hate the feel of lotion, it makes me feel greasy. This doesn&#x27;t feel like that which is good. It does smell kinda feminine which I don&#x27;t really like, I wish it just didn&#x27;t smell at all, so I&#x27;d suggest showering before hanging out with anyone. I&#x27;d also suggest waiting 8 hours before showering (not the 5-6 recommended). Finally I&#x27;d recommend not doing a vigorous workout in a white shirt 6 hours after putting it on (learned that the hard way, apply it the night before an off day). Good luck, men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge self tanning freak.. I&#x27;ve done it everyday for almost two years now and have tried just about every product there is. This is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve found (that is self aplicable). I spray directly on my body and smooth it out with the glove. Make sure you stand in your shower (without water running of course) or in an enclosed area where you can wipe the spray off the ground because it WILL get on the ground. It&#x27;s soooo good though... gets me so dark and lasts FOREVER! Great product and great price</li>
            <li> So first of all i must say i absolutely love love love this product! i am 21 and was completely hooked on tanning beds from age 15.. however i know that it is not good for my skin and i have been off them since November. i have been using jergens daily glow to keep from getting super pasty( i am Irish with naturally platinum hair). however i am going to Florida for spring break and wanted some color! i ordered this product and used it for the first time last night. i used the spray nasal after trimming the tube to fit the bottle. i sprayed onto the mit for my face, neck, chest and back but sprayed directly onto my tummy, arms and legs and then blended. the color looked amazing on my body right away but i was a little worried about my face because  i have acne scars from my teens years . the tanner made my acne scars stand out more when i initially applied it.it kinda made them look brown to be honest... this being said i would recommend that if you have acne scars that you apply this at night before bed when you don&#x27;t have to go out in public... overnight the tanner blends in. in the morning i washed my face with a gentle cleanser in the shower and the color looked amazing and did not make my acne scars stand out the way it did the night before. if anything it makes my skin look more even and hides my scars now!i usually have to use concealer over foundation to even out my skin and today i just used a bit of BB cream. the color is awesome and not at all orange. it dries very quickly and i havent noticed any on my clothing from last night or today. this looks better than any spray tan ive ever had, it looks like i&#x27;ve spent a week on vacay!it also smells like Malibu rum &#x3D;]a steal for the price!</li>
            <li> works! i would recommend it to friends. I dont like how if you put too much on in one place it will be blachy</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I ever tried/used. It beats every spray, cream, foam, towelette that&#x27;s out there. It is very easy to use, gives you a nice color right away, dries lightning fast, didn&#x27;t transfer onto any of my clothes or sheets, isn&#x27;t ORANGE. Putting on self tanner and building up color has always been a tedious task for me but this product is so great that I don&#x27;t feel that way when I use it- i just put it on before bed and that&#x27;s it. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best tanner ever! Smells wonderful and it looks very natural! The best part is the mitt that it comes with. Perfect for apply to the face and hands. NO ORANGE HANDS ANYMORE! Great product!! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many tanning products, believe me. This product is awesome. The color is so natural and no unpleasant smell. Also it is so easy to apply and NO STREAKS! I will definitely be reordering this when I need it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Prefacing this with &amp;#34;I followed the directions exactly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 28 year old female with pretty light skin (daywalker here). I wanted this to assist me in getting into the summer season and give me a base tan so I could confidently wear shorts (I&#x27;ve always hated my legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed the mitt once or twice and began rubbing in very light circles, moving from one area to another while applying harder pressure as the wet/dampness wore off. Then, I would repeat. The parts that rec&#x27;d the initial fresh, wet mitt turned out noticeably darker than other areas. Maybe the mitt wasn&#x27;t wet enough and you&#x27;re really supposed to drench the thing or maybe my skin is super dry and absorbed the wetness immediately, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was very difficult to apply and turned out quite splotchy--I will post pics. Because of this, I am going to wait for it to fade completely before reapplying in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I:&lt;br /&gt; -exfoliated very well&lt;br /&gt; -was clean-shaven&lt;br /&gt; -followed the directions exactly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the product:&lt;br /&gt; -the color is amazing, very nice brown&lt;br /&gt; -smells great&lt;br /&gt; -comes with everything you need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally going to give 2* when I realized that I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear a knee-length skirt in a dimly-lit bar but I will keep it at 3 until I attempt a different technique the next time I try it.</li>
            <li> i love it did kind of get on clothes but i love it will order more</li>
            <li> This is my go to self tanner. It is incredibly easy to get an even application</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I don&#x27;t feel like it leaves an orange color. It&#x27;s subtle but still noticeable. Had very little issues with streaking but that was because I&#x27;m a beginner at this. Now I have no issues. I wish it would last a little longer though. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last even a week.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I read so many great reviews on it and decided to give it a try. Ice has bad experiences with sunless tanners in the past so I was skeptical about this. I&#x27;ve used tanning beds off and on during the summer time for a good 8 years, I am only 28 and was recently diagnosed with Melanoma. So tanning beds are out of the questions for me now. I am so glad I found Fake Bake Flawless, I can now get a natural golden tan without the damage of the sun or tanning bed. I wish I found this years ago. I honestly think the tan with Fake Bake looks better than the tan I get from sun/tanning bed. Very easy application, can&#x27;t go wrong with the spray and mitt. Dries quickly, very little smell and haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off on my clothes. My mom even ordered a bottle cause she was surprised how well the color looked. I&#x27;ll continue to buy Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> The best fake tan for coloured skin and white skin and dry skin and scarred skin! Gorgeous colour !</li>
            <li> Not bad stuff. Fast and easy to apply. Though, maybe, it could be darker. It seemed to fade nicely everywhere but my neck and chest area...in those areas it faded horribly in patches and spots. Not sure what to do about that...it&#x27;s semi-fixable if you apply more so for that I take off one star. But it&#x27;s probably the best tanner I&#x27;ve used...better than Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> perfect, no streaking</li>
            <li> Love this product!  This works as well, if not better than most of the more expensive sunless tanners that I have tried.  The color is rich and very believable.  The product also has a decent scent!  Amazing!  Easy to use as well.  Please, please continue to offer this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff washes off to fast</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, zero streaking, beautiful color and no bad smell.  What else do you need?</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  The body lotion spray doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint as some products do.  I am a fair skinned red head and it&#x27;s hard to find this type of product that doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint, but this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  It goes on well and looks real.  I also recommend the face fake bake lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the face as splotchy for those people who are older like me who have large pores.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. It came off onto my underwear and clothes. Unfortunately, I ordered 2  bottles. I will never use.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. However, like others have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t last very long and it has an aroma somewhat like a three dollar hooker might have. It goes on easily and evenly. I just don&#x27;t like the smell and that it has an expiration date. After which, is still smells but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I tried the Fake Bake Lotion last year, and really liked the results. It gave a nice, even, natural-looking tan to my fair skin. However, it was a little messy to apply, so I thought the spray version might be an easier application. I found that this product really was easier and less messy to apply - just spray on the included mitt and rub in. No messy hands that you have to be careful to wash before they stain, and it seems to blend in to the skin even better than the lotion did. I&#x27;m very happy with the ease of use and the results, and I&#x27;m no longer the palest chick at Zumba class!</li>
            <li> I used to tan in beds, or lay out in the sun. yes i realize horrible for my skin. going into this summer I&#x27;ve decided to take care of my skin while I&#x27;m still young, but that means no more golden tan :( I did a little research and found this. decided to try it out reading all the good reviews was sure it would be good. and it was BETTER THAN I EVEN EXPECTED. goes on without streaks, looks natural, and one layer is light enough even if you make a mistake (which i did while I&#x27;m getting the hang of it) that it isn&#x27;t completely noticeable. Going to put it on one more night and then I&#x27;ll probably be as tan as can look natural on my pale skin. thank you fake bake!!! will be using this for as long as it is made :)</li>
            <li> I have always hated self tanner. No matter how bad i tried to make it even, it would streak usually BUT i bought this and OMG!!!!! AMAZING! It looks real and it doesn&#x27;t stink! 100% 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for a fast and easy tan! Shows up dark so you know its even! Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! I am a redhead, and my complexion is very fair. I&#x27;ve tried so many products! It has great color and goes on easily. No streaks and no orange! It didn&#x27;t last that long though. I also didn&#x27;t do much to keep it on like moisturize or refrain from shaving. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used it last night when I got out of the shower- it is awesome. No smell, and the color it leaves is brown, not orange like other brands tend to do. Great seller! Fast shipping! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  All the positive reviews are for real!  It leaves my skin the perfect color.  It is super easy to use.  The mitt that comes with it does need to be washed every couple times you use it, but it washes up really well.  Some of the color does wash off in the shower the next day, but the color is still on your body.  I will only use this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I am very fair and have always wished for a dream tan like you see people have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing.  It gives you the perfect tan with no orange effects.  I love how it naturally gets darker with each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read tips from other users and agree with the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut the tube of the sprayer.  It is way to long.  The spray head will leak some.  Just wipe it up with the mit while applying.&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep mit clean.  Wash in sink with a luke warm water and soap after every use.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not get on linolium (not sure if I spelled that correctly) flooring.  A small drop fell onto mine and the floor bleached a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply&#x27;s evenly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put a little dab of lotion on knees, elbows, hands, and feet before applying.&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells Great.&lt;br /&gt;4 Dry&#x27;s quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tried to purchase the Xen Tan Blending Balm everyone was talking about.  However, I was unable to find it.  Everyone had it back ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did it with nothing but a little lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all LOVED THE PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and some trial and error I think I have found my self tanner! I have light to medium skin tone and I tan easily but don&#x27;t want the negative effects of UV rays. ANYWAY, I find that this product is extremely easy to use and its effective. The color guard is fool proof and completely wearable if you are wanting to wear it during the day (as long as you won&#x27;t be sweating). I didn&#x27;t feel that I looked orange at all and it blends over rough spots like knees and elbows beautifully. My real trouble spot is my ankles and as long as there&#x27;s some lotion on there this blends perfectly over there too!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish the color was more build able, I feel like if I really want to maintain a deep color I have to apply every two days. Also, if you tend to have dry skin I would absolutely recommend moisturizing like crazy after you rinse off the color guard, before your next application because if I don&#x27;t my skin looks a tiny bit scaly. Other then that I really love this stuff, the smell is really good with little to no self tanner smell afterwards and I have been using this on my face with no breakouts or irritation (I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though)&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is easy to apply and the color looks natural. No one even noticed that it was self tanner. I was complemented several time on how good my tan looked!</li>
            <li> I am medium tone skin, tan in the summer- used in spring and was satisfied with the outcome.  This doesn&#x27;t smell bad nor does it appear orangey or streaky, there is a mitt that comes with it.  I just moisturizer prior to spraying it on and only do small areas at a time, wipe fast because it does dry fast-I like that though because I hate waiting on a self tanner to dry before putting my clothes on.  Like all self tanners, I would not put on a white bra, tank etc just afterwards because it will stain it a little.</li>
            <li> This is sooooo easy to apply with the mitt which is provided.  I just put it on this morning and cleaned the mitt immediately afterwards..I didn&#x27;t use gloves but washed my hands and I have to tell you, that this product goes on with ease..just spray it on the mitt and wipe over areas you wish to tan..easy breezy!  And, the scent is out of this world...not bad like the other products.</li>
            <li> So being 31 years old, I know that tanning isn&#x27;t good for me...i spent my 20&#x27;s getting as much sun as possible, but it seems like more and more people I know are getting skin cancer. :( I live in the upper Midwest, so being as white as a fish&#x27;s belly is common, but I still don&#x27;t like it. Which brings me to my goal of two things for an upcoming friends wedding: getting in shape and being tan. Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 totally helped with the first goal, but that&#x27;s a totally separate review.&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended the fake bake by the beauty supply store I shop at, and I find amazons price very comparable. I had realized the wedding was only a week away-did I mention an ex boyfriend would be there? Hence my need to impress...anyway, even a tanning salon couldn&#x27;t get me tan in just a few days. First off, the mitt is awesome. I love not getting it on my hands, and I&#x27;ve been rinsing it out per another review. (I shaved and exfoliated first.) the non aerosol spray is easy to use, it has a nice tropical scent, a gorgeous, believable color, quick dry time, and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, sheets, etc. Even when I&#x27;m sweating to Jillian Michaels.:)&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used this 3 times, and love love the way I look...im tan in places that usually don&#x27;t tan well, such as my face, and the color is totally believable without being streaky. I&#x27;ve found a much cheaper and safer alternative to tanning, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I apply this once a week to prepare for the beach this summer.  I get a nice golden glow quickly and evenly in no time.  I do exfoliate and scrub my feet as well since I put it on my feet too!  No dark spots, but I do go over my knees, ankles and feet with cream and let that soak in before I apply this.</li>
            <li> I love Fake bake!! It&#x27;s the best product from all the other name there is in the market. U have to use it ones a week to keep the color .</li>
            <li> So after reading tons and tons of reviews of different self tanning products. I thought surely this is the product for me. With no time to actually go get spray tanned and wanting to get the best value for my dollar, I thought this product was for sure the way to go. My excitement was so high for this product to only go down more and more as I use the product. I followed many of the steps suggested by other reviewers such as cutting the straw, exfoliating before, etc even with this I found streaking and mind you I am very meticulous. I also found that with someone having dark hair and pale skin if not out in the sun, even this product cannot hide my bodies imperfections. (I.e. dark hair follicules, razor burn, scars, etc.) I know that with many spray tans they tend to hide these imperfections or even freckles more than your tanning bed or outside tanning experience. So this was also a reason why I was excited because with me running my own business I lack the time needed to be outside all day and/or to go daily to a tanning salon. For those with dark hair, that will show even once you shave, this is still not the product we are needing and looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Other cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin looking orange&lt;br /&gt;- Leves certain areas lighter and/or darker&lt;br /&gt;- Enhances imperfections (razor burn. Dark hair follicules, scars, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased 12 boxes of this thinking for certain this was going to be the best product I have tried and seen. Well now after using one box and following every step and reviewer advice to a T. I am returning the other 11 boxes. As I want a flawless, sun kissed tan, just not one that does not cover my body evenly and leaves me orange.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading all the good reviews about it. I was a little nervous cause I have fairly light skin and usually do not tan easy. I love how the product doesnt have such a strong smell. I liked how it was pretty easy to use, just wish the glove fit a little better so it would stay in place when applying. I was applying this at night after a shower and prob around 4-5 hours before bed (so plenty of time for it to sink in and dry). I noticed it was stainging my sheets and thats why im not a huge fan of this product. I will be trying to find another self tanner but might continue using this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but even after exfoliating using a Kae exfoliating glove, it still goes on unevenly and looks orange. It also seems to wash off fairly easy. I have also used with the Xen Tan blending balm with no success. I wish I had not wasted my money. The straw is too long so cut before putting into the bottle. I also washed my mitt after  every use. The scent is pleasant until the next morning and you can still smell the sunless tanner smell. Not as strong as most tanners. Overall I am disappointed with the product and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of self tanners.  I&#x27;ve tried several of them-but the results are mixed.  Mostly I feel as though I should wear a sign saying &amp;#34;Fake tan here.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve long since stopped sunning myself, and tanning beds are not safe-so what to do? Self tanners are the only other choice if you want some color.  Well, this works.  The color is excellent.  And the color continues to develop over time.  I have used it three times-two days apart each time-and it looks good.  The price is great and the results are impressive.  Try it...</li>
            <li> THE BEST fake tanner out there. Once you spray it on though, be quick to rub it in. I use lotion first, so it&#x27;s blends in with the skin easier. A+!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  However, I&#x27;d rather use the NEW Jergens glow which is completely unscented and achieves a more natural look.  It&#x27;s less expensive, too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE!! Gave me a great color after a few applications. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very promptly and as stated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big production to put it on all over evenly, but the results are very nice.</li>
            <li> As a natural redhead with corpse-like pale skin, I need fake and bake in order to feel like a normal person during the summer and not look like the walking dead.  Trust me -- I&#x27;ve tried it all, from Jergen&#x27;s lotion to spending $40 on a fake bake at the salon.  I wish I had found Fake Bake sooner.  I don&#x27;t say this too lightly when I say this is the best self-tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  First, it gives you an insta-tan.  No waiting until morning to have that natural looking tan.  Oh, did I say natural looking?  It looks natural looking!  Goodbye orange glow!  It&#x27;s super easy to apply, using the mix that comes with the spray.  Spray and rub in, easy as that!  My only con is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long and most of it will come off once you take a shower.  But how natural looking it does look is so worth over-looking that con.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!  Love the wonderful fragrance....a bonus on using this, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great price and product. Highly recommend! Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> nice smell, easy application, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Makes me tan like I&#x27;m Cuban! Nice color. Definitely the darkest sunless tanner I ever used. I think the best way to use it is put it on at night before bed then wash in shower in morning to have it blend better. If you were to put it on and just go outside it can get a little darker then someone that usually uses light tanners is used to.</li>
            <li> Returning the product. Although it did not smell bad and the color looked good, the application was a mess. The spray color went on the mitt but also everywhere else on the walls and floors of my small bathroom. It was a mess to clean up and not with my time. I will go back to using Xentan or a lotion product.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used. It is just like the fancy spray tans at the salons but you can easily do it yourself. Gives you a rich tan even on first go. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I literally got it about 40 minutes ago. I followed the directions (exfoliated and whatnot) and started to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time ever using any sort of tanning (I&#x27;ve never gone to tanning place to get a natural or a fake tan nor have I ever used an at home tanner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, right away you can see the color change. I was expecting to look a bit orange, but not even a single hint of orange appeared. It went on simply and quickly (taking me about ten minutes to apply it feet to head). It dried really fast and instantly looks great. I am a bigger girl so I embarrassingly have, for lack of a better word, crevices, where I had a bit of trouble applying, but ultimately was able to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big con to the product for me was the mitt. Perhaps it was just mine, but it left brown fuzzes on my body occasional. It was no big deal because taking some toilet paper and gently wiping my skin seemed to get them off without affecting the color. Still, it was pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for me (as I am super pale) the first application gave me a very nice sunkissed look. But, I think I want a bit darker (especially on my legs which were naturally lighter than my arms so they still appear lighter), so I intend to follow the directions and apply it two nights in a row to see if I can get the color just how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is it smells great. I am not usually a fan of the coconut smell, but this is so soft and subtle that it is actually quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have given it a five out of five if it had not been for my mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I highly recommend it for first time tanners like myself since it was so easy. I also suggest having someone there to do your back because right now I have a big gap of space where I could not reach. Luckily no one ever sees that area anyways, but for people who wear backless shirts or bikinis or other clothing that shows the back it would be something that they would worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So summary;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Faulty mitt, hard to apply on backsomething that they would worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So summary;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Quick, simple, nice smell, looks good, no orange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Faulty mitt, hard to apply on back</li>
            <li> couldnt really get how to make this look good, it looks really streaky when I applied it. maybe i need to work on it more?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, i buy it religiously! Goes on great, I dont get streaks or look orange, but nothing lasts like a real tan of course, but this is close enough. Doesnt come off blotchy like spray tans!</li>
            <li> I love fake bake. I have not found a better self tanner out there and have been using it intermittently since 2013. Other reviewers on Amazon have given great recommendations on how to use this product and I recommend you read those too. This product has never been streaky. I am very pale and I like that with one application there is a difference but it is not so dramatic that people notice right away or that it is obvious I self tanned. I love the smell of this product and so does my boyfriend. It does not smell like a self tanner, instead it is very tropical smelling. Be sure to wash your mitt in the washer every once in a while, and I try to rinse my mitt after every application.  Fyi, I had an old bottle of this that I tried to use this month, and I noticed the liquid was spraying on the mitt green. While most of you might find this appalling, I was really happy about this. The bottle was about two years old, and the fact that it went bad means it has natural ingredients. Fake bake flawless is free of parabens! I&#x27;d rather have a skin product that expires on me than one that is everlasting due to parabens.  I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough. I was so tired of spending money trying to find a good self tanner. Thanks to fake bake I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless is AWESOME if you want a good tan and don&#x27;t want to use a tanning bed. You MUST be careful with the application, too much will make you orange. Perfect for a natural glow, just don&#x27;t layer it on too much at one time. Do as the instructions recommend and apply another layer each day if you are not satisfied with the color. It DOES darken over time! So if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dark enough at night, it will be in the morning. Also, be careful when you put it on your hands, they will be orange. I find that exfoliating with a loofa (while showering), then applying and wait for it to dry, then moisturizing is the best process for even color and locking it it. Works awesome on face and neck too. Overall, great product, just be sure to watch a youtube video before you apply the first time, there&#x27;s a lot of good ones out there!</li>
            <li> Ive tried nearly every lotion and potion on the market to try and get a natural looking faux-tan and I believe this will be the one I stick with. To begin with I have a very fair complexion, dark hair, light blue eyes and tons of freckles of every shape and size. In my early years I worshipped the tanning bed just so I could look normal in the summer months (its been joked that Im so white I glow in the dark!). I followed everyones suggestions of exfoliating and applying lotion to dry areas before application. I suggest putting on your swimsuit and applying OUTSIDE in natural daylight. Thats the only way to make sure you havent missed any spots or applied too much in one area. Fades evenly. Im applying lightly twice a week to maintain and using Jergans gradual tan lotion in light on the off days. The squirt top does leak and gets messy, even after I cut a half inch off the tubing, havent found a fix for that, and thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best self tanner in the world. it dont streak or make you look orange. i use to go to zoom tan an get sprayed. an honestly i looked so orange compared to this stuff. it has more of a green undertone than orange an it looks like a real tan not a fake one..</li>
            <li> Best Tanner I have tried in a while.  This one has the least scent I have ever come across in a tanner formula.  It&#x27;s great because my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t complain!  I also love how smooth it goes on and very little streaking if you&#x27;re careful!</li>
            <li> I am so happy i found this product because i will never use tanning machine anymore. This product is really good and leaves your skin naturally tan and for its price OMG is the best. The tan last and skin looks natural. With this product you dont need to go salon for airbrush tanning either and this product costs much less and last a lot since comes in good amount and you can use it for longer than expected. I highly recommend this product. Its the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for getting some color, but I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t get as dark as I would like.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanner ever. I have tried so many and this by far is the best. It smells great, makes you look tan (not orange), dries fast and is easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Use as directeed and you will have a beautiful looking tan. I&#x27;ve reccomended this product to many of my friends and clients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of self-tanners and had given up until I came across a recommendation for this in a blog. No matter how well a tanner goes on, how great the color is, or how long it lasts, I won&#x27;t use it if it has that tell-tale self-tanner smell. This one doesn&#x27;t!!! I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to have finally found this product! The mitt makes application very simple and it has a great smell when you first put it on but more importantly, it never develops the &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; smell. I shower at night and put it on before I go to bed and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my pjs or my sheets. I am very fair skinned and even so, I wish the color was a bit darker but it&#x27;s good enough (especially with no smell!). I break out very easily and have used a small amount of this on my face (just whatever is left on the mitt when I&#x27;m done with my body) and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner produces more of a bronze color vs the orange color I usually develop with other products. It took me about 2-3 applications to get a fairly dark tan. The color-guiding bronzer does not wash off in the shower if you do a light rinse/wash. From my experience, the color develops in about 4-5 hours and gets a shade or so deeper than the initial color-guiding bronzer. Doesn&#x27;t smell too awful, but it does have a hint of the normal self-tanner odor. Feels light on the skin, dries quickly and you&#x27;re not left with that sticky feeling for hours. Goes on evenly, although I have a hard time getting an even coat around my neck/collarbone area. This could be due to me being lazy and not washing the mitt (could be the residual bronzer from other applications). This product is good enough for me to recommend to my sister, since we both understand the damaging effects of the sun, but desire a believable looking tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for the price. I love the final color. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I&#x27;ve re-ordered this product 4 or 5 times. Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better than this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. You aren&#x27;t going to find the perfect self tanner but this truly comes close for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* GREAT brown color. A few reviews reported an orange color. I have been using this product for over a year now &amp; have never experienced this. You HAVE to exfoliate &amp; hydrate your skin for an even color, just like with any other tanning product or tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Easy application. Love the mitten. Really helps apply an even color all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I just love the smell of this stuff &amp; so does my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The price is incredible, compared to tanning memberships and other tanning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Instant color &amp; keeps getting darker with time and extra applications. You don&#x27;t have to wait HOURS for your tan to develop &amp; it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I found it does wash off easily but if you have several applications it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It will stain fabric if you are spraying it onto your mitt and it mists around it. I have to keep a bottle of stain remover nearby when I&#x27;m doing my applications. Just a little inconvenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It does not have a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I wish the mitt came with a place for your thumb! :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for what you&#x27;re paying for. Seriously the best out there. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Love the product I use it every two days, the color is a bronze color.  Easy to use and the smell is fine.  Not blochy looks natural</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and have never had any luck with self tanners...one mistake and you can&#x27;t fix it.  This product works so gradually that you have a chance to correct any areas that look too light or heavy with the product.  After a week, I had a great natural looking tan.  The color is very different from every other tanner I&#x27;ve used, no orangy look at all.  It even added great color to my face. Perfect :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous fake tans over the years and the aerosol spray I used to use I cannot find for a decent price, so after a few attempts this year with new products I decided to try this. I love it. First, it really does dry well so I don&#x27;t feel like I am sticky going to bed. (I have grey sheets and I didn&#x27;t see any transfer of the tan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips for using:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  I prefer to spray my body with the spray THEN use the buffing pad. I find that I don&#x27;t get streaks that way.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  IF you have streaks I LOVE the FAKE BAKE FAUX SHIMMER to intensify my tan or touch up any spots I missed. [[ASIN:B004BEFQUU Fake Bake Golden Faux Glo-Shimmer, 4.22-Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;3.)  To reach your back, I use a back applicator which is like a sponge on a stick, you can search on amazon they sell many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are my tips. Also, I am super pale, when I go to the makeup counter I am the lightest shade they make and this looks natural on me, not orange. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> There is no better product I have tried so many and have always come back to this formula great naurtal color sun kisses great great buy won&#x27;t get any other product</li>
            <li> Wifey loves this stuff. Works great and does not leave a residue on all our sheets and pillows or clothes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! No streaks no horrible odor! Goes on quickly and dries instantly. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. It takes ,e about 10 mins to apply to my entire body! I cannot say enough about this product. It looks natural and lasts a long time on the body and in the bottle! Love love love!</li>
            <li> So disappointed I wish I coul get my money back!! It streaks ad doesn&#x27;t deliver as it says it does:(</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have ghost pale skin and this is the best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I was a little worried after another reviewer said it didn&#x27;t work on her pale skin, but it was fine for me.  I sprayed about 3-4 &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; onto the brown-side of the mitt and rubbed it in circular motions.  There is a sort of brown &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34;? that shows where you&#x27;ve already rubbed the tanner in, it helped enormously in making sure I didn&#x27;t miss any spots.  The brown-ish guide paint stuff also adhered really well and didn&#x27;t come off until I showered the next day.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t sweat AT ALL while putting this on, it&#x27;ll run and get on everything.  Other than that, I found this to be the easiest tanner to use so far and I liked that it looks pretty natural.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again although it seems to take so little to rub in, I think this bottle may last quite awhile, even better!</li>
            <li> I dont tan! I have fair skin w/ freckles and i love this product! it goes on evenly and does not streak! Scent of it does not bother me i just got used to it and you cant smell it after you rinse off the color guard anyways. Which i dont really see any color come off when i rinse.  i use it before bed and rinse off in the morning. Gives me a great glow i havent put so much on that it looks dark i just needed something that wont make me look ghostly at the beach and this is it!  love the fact you can build the color up to how you want it. And i do not turn orange! yay! highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews I had high expectations for Fake Bake Flawless. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the flawless results. I followed the instructions and in the morning I did look tan. Until I took a shower and it washed off. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got this a a couple weeks before a wedding Im going to, to see how well it worked just so I could scrub it all off if it looked ratchet! It&#x27;s amazing! All the bad reviews on here should be disregarded if you really know how to exfoliate well and apply the right way ( I have my own spray machine, but I ran out of liquid n that stuff expensive, so I know exactly how you should properly prep your skin and apply.) I am seriously thinking about just getting rid of my spray machine and doing fake bake full time cause I got the same amazing results and it wasn&#x27;t near as expensive as the professional spray liquid my machine takes! Hands down amazing product! I&#x27;m not orange I&#x27;m brown and I look like a sun kissed goddess! If you&#x27;re looking for a good inexpensive product this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Ever other self tanner I have tried has turned me orange and stung my eyes, not to mention smelled wierd. This product is absolutely amazing! I actually look tan and people ask me if I&#x27;ve gone tanning all the time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally olive skin and tan easily. I tan outside and in a tanning bed when I can, but I wanted to try this after seeing so many great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated with a loofa, put on lotion, and waited about an hour. Then I moisturized my face, elbows, knees, and ankles. I applied the spray right onto my body and then rubbed it in with the mit. OMG! It was sooooo easy to apply and blend! I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all! it dried right away and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already fairly tan, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was going to show up on me. At first when I applied it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but as time passed I could see it getting darker. It&#x27;s a nice golden brown, not orange at all. It looks so natural! We&#x27;ll see how well it lasts and fades!</li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times now and love it! .. I will give one pointer, the first two times i used it i followed the directions and sprayed on the glove and then rubbed it on myself - it left a few streak marks and were a little blotchy .. the next two times a friends recomended I spray it directly on myself (in small areas at a time) and then rub it in .. it worked so much better! very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is my second bottle! Works how It says! No streaking or fading uneven. Definatly get this!</li>
            <li> I got this after trying several different things including the Tan Towel (which I did not like) - I loved this after the first use!&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to you, the directions say to spray directly onto the mitt and then rub onto the body but I found spraying it directing onto my body and then rubbing it in works much better, just simply do one area at a time. It takes me about 10 mins. This stuff dries INSTANTLY! Love it! I can get dressed literally right after using it, and leaving it on all day while going about your business is no problem either. It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, either. It smells SO good - very tropical. No fake tan smell at all. A full bottle lasts for about 18-20 full body applications, i would say. and it has a color guard! You can see exactly where you are putting it! I had no streaks at all, make sure you don&#x27;t get wet or sweat within the first couple hours of using it, I washed my hands and a drip ran down my leg, giving me a little streak mark. The only half complaint I have is with the mitt. The mitt, first of all is awesome and I believe is the secret to the success of fake tanning! BUT it does wear out before you are done with your bottle. I wish I could find one just like it to have on hand (I&#x27;ll have to look) Give this product a try, I get compliments on my tan all the time! I use this pretty much every other day and I have a very consistent tan, which doesn&#x27;t bother me. When it fades it does look a little bit funny (to be expected) but nothing outrageous looking, as long as you use it every 2 days or so, you wont have any fade at all.</li>
            <li> I tried too many self tanners in my life and this one is the best product by far!!! Dries fast, looks natural, the only con is that it&#x27;s a little bit expensive......</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skinned and this product is not streaky or orange, it is the best self tanning product I have tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> Messy , but very good product 😊</li>
            <li> Great tanner, red undertones, not orange at all. Use alone or add to lotion to make it last longer. It does stain clothing, so wear dark clothes until u shower.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, drying and comes out uneven and you look like a yam! Very fake looking (hens the name!!)</li>
            <li> Great price. Very easy to use and goes on perfectly. Will continue to buy this product. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and some of the girls asked if I spent money on a tanning salon spray tan. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the Fake Bake products.  I&#x27;m a lily white Irish girl who used to live in the sun.  I&#x27;ve done a ton of sun damage that I&#x27;ve been trying to reverse for the past 15 years.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, and this stuff is amazing.  The ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange!  The first night I put it on, my husband came into the room and said, &amp;#34;do my legs&amp;#34;.  His upper body is always tan, so he wanted some color now that it&#x27;s time for shorts.  He would never have had me put it on if it didn&#x27;t look real.  He said that I looked like I had been on vacation.  I have been using this in conjunction with the Fake Bake Glo-Shimmer.  I was hoping for more of a shimmer (you really can&#x27;t see any difference), however it does help darken the tan from the Flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I exfoliate like crazy, especially my face.  I use a Clarisonic, so I don&#x27;t put any fake tanner on my face.  I used mineral make-up, so I just darkened that a little and it matches perfectly to my tan.  This way my face is not uneven, and I can use my moisturizers and do my nightly routine with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Fake Bake products, is that they don&#x27;t last.  I have to apply every night, unless it&#x27;s going to rain the next day.  Mine always washes off, but again, I do like to really exfoliate my body and moisturize my arms and legs.  With that being said, it&#x27;s inexpensive, so I just buy an extra bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time to apply, and it dries ASAP, so I don&#x27;t mind doing it daily.  That&#x27;s the only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great! And looks so natural</li>
            <li> Im a guy, Im Irish, and I can&#x27;t tan :/ My dermatologist also told me I shouldn&#x27;t because of my high risk skin. I tried pray tans but looked a little orange even with the better brands so I read the reviews and tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT! Apply it before bed, its really easy and wash it off in the morning, about half the color gets washed away but whats left if a light BROWN (not orange) tan. I typically leave it on my face for an hour or two then wash it off before bed. I&#x27;ve layered this up for a couple of nights and now I look better than I ever have! My boyfriend is really picky when it comes to fake tans (he hates them) but he thinks this looks really good and encourages me to use it. Im stocking up in case for some reason it goes off the market. Get it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I just received my box in the mail and it was completely soaked through with product, I am returning it and am not sure if I will rebuy. If I do I will update my review. I heard the bottle leaked but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive this way. On a positive note I don&#x27;t even like coconut and it smells amazing, I&#x27;m giving it another star for this.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this product and it dries quickly.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it does seem to settle in the pores of my legs.</li>
            <li> Best tanner ever.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long at all. Just have to be consistent about putting it on or it will wash away in days. This bottle will last a good amount of time. Apply every other day by using the brown mitt that is included. Spray some on the velvet side and lightly buff over your whole body. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, that&#x27;s what I have bronzer for, but I know they have a face tanner from this same company.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake! The color it gives you is so natural and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange. It has a tropical smell to it and is easily applied using the mitt. The tan lasts generally about a week for me and I love that!!! My Husband mentioned I have come along way with trying out Self Tanners and this was is so far the best as far as natural look and no gaudy smell! I will defiantly be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and after exfoliating this product seemed spotty....obsorbing irregularly. Filling pores on my upper so that it appeared dirty. I like the application mitt and the fact that you can see where it applys on your skin then disappears but for me it just isn&#x27;t the right product. I prefer a moisturizing self tanner. You can buy their moisturizer separately but I&#x27;d prefer it as a 1 complete product. The color is a walnut like stain....not so great for fair blondes. I would recommend this for a younger person with darker features ( brunette) that has very moist skin...it would probably work great.</li>
            <li> This is the least streaky fake tanner that I have ever used (and my pale self has used a ton). If you just rub it on with the mitt that they give you, it is fantastic and blends right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty translucent. I like the color. It&#x27;s pretty brown, not orange. But it doesn&#x27;t get very dark the first go round. I have very Irish skin, and it gives me some color, but I don&#x27;t look normal people tan. Just a little less ghostly. I tend to apply two coats every time. It builds very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I remember to use it often, I can build up a pretty nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the mitt is fantastic. I&#x27;ve used lotions in the past and just put them on with my gloved hands, but it was never as, well, flawless as this. The mitt is soft, and I use it about twice before I just throw it in the washing machine. Just make sure to wear gloves under the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong. It&#x27;s kind of sweet when you put it on. After it sits for a while, it gets a touch of the fake tan smell, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some of the others that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly. I try to put it on and walk around naked cleaning or picking things up so I don&#x27;t have to sit down for a little bit ( because I&#x27;m paranoid), but I could put clothes on like 5 minutes after application honestly. It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my bed or clothes, so that is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has the color guide in it, so you&#x27;re not just guessing if you missed places. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m shaving, putting on lotion, putting on sunscreen or whatever, I ALWAYS miss spots. Not with this. I can see it when I do and go back and touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this product. I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fake tanning products since I was 12. I&#x27;m 47 now. This is the most realistic looking fake tan I&#x27;ve achieved. My arms and chest have a healthy glow. I&#x27;ve very pale and freckle easily, so if I&#x27;m not sure that this is the product for you if you&#x27;re looking for a Brazilian bronze glow. I was just looking for less flounder belly white. I am having more difficulty getting even coverage on my legs, but I suspect that I&#x27;m not using enough product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like coconut and it is strong, but at least you won&#x27;t smell like your skin is burning. I can live with coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no trouble with streaking, like I&#x27;ve gotten with other products. It dries amazingly fast and I haven&#x27;t noticed any on my clothing or sheets. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling slimy. The coverage indicating bronzer will wash away in the shower, but your skin will still be tan.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem with water splotching at it&#x27;s been raining every day here for weeks. I&#x27;ve had that horrible look getting caught in the rain after an expensive spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a week. It says that once you&#x27;ve achieved your tan that you will only have to apply once a week. I&#x27;m not buying that claim. I achieved the level I was happy with, but after 3 days of not applying, color was fading fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it does make age spots and freckles darker.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. The mitt is intimidating, but totally easy and looks so natural!</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars, because it is better than most self-tanners.  It doesn&#x27;t have the bad smell that most self-tanners have and it provides a natural, non-streaky color after you shower the next day to wash off the tint.  With that being said, there are a few things I don&#x27;t like about the product.  It has a built-in tint, so that you can see where it goes as you are applying it.  The tint gives you instant color.  However, it settles into your pores, highlighting them.  You really need to apply this at night and wash off the tint the next morning to reveal the natural color that is underneath it.  I used two days worth of coats and I wished the color could have been darker, but it was fairly natural and not streaky, so I am happy with that.</li>
            <li> I became concerned about using tanning beds and live in a rural area and it&#x27;s inconvenience for me to go spray tan, so I thought I&#x27;d try Fake Bake.  I am very pleased with the product.  It&#x27;s easy to use, looks natural, takes less time to apply than lying in a tanning bed, and is much less expensive and safer.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I think i have tried almost every product for self tanning. I do like Tan Towels and the Neutrogena spray, however I still was not completely satisfied about the color. I found it slightly on the yellow/golden side and I wanted more on the bronze/brown side. I have fair skin. I do not tan simply because I prefer to keep my skin cancer and wrinkle free as long as possible, especially since skin cancer runs in the family, So, self tanning is something I have been doing for years. I read the review by Glynis Ewing and decided to give it a try. AMAZING! Now, it took two applications to get a nice light tan that I wanted. This is probably because, as Glynis recommended, I did moisturize before application. This is also why I think there was no streaking or blotches. If you want the perfect tan, get the product, read the instructions in Glynis Ewing&#x27;s review here on Amazon and you will get fantastic results. Here are a couple additions recommendations to her instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the body exfoliation, I just used my exfoliating mitts, You can find them on Amazon or at the drugstore and should not cost more than $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy extra plastic gloves to wear under the mitt. There are only two sets in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do moisturize. The fake bake oil spray did not arrive in time, so I just used the new Suave spray. I suspect it does not matter as long as you apply evenly all over, and very well on knees, feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t rub too hard. That is how some users get the bit of fluff from the mitt on their skin. Even if you do, if you do it at night, just rinse off in the morn. In fact, I would only recommend doing it at night. The stuff can rub off, and if you sweat, that may mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be extra light when you rub across feet, knees and elbows. You can always go back if you need to and tan more, but over tanning is annoying to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St, Tropez tanning makes a remover that when applied within 4 hrs of tanning will remove the tanner. Good for mistakes. Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!nner. Good for mistakes. Fortunately, after following Glynis&#x27;s instructions, I had none!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product!!! There&#x27;s no cheap smell you get with usual tanners or streaky color.  Just make sure to absolutely exfoliate before applying fake bake or it will get patchy like typical tanners.  No complaints here just that i will be purchasing more as soon as i run out :-)</li>
            <li> Best product on the market. Doesn&#x27;t look fake and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. last about a week. Love the glove that come with it so that it keep the product off your hands. GREAT Find!!!</li>
            <li> Still cakes in spots I think.  I have spots that do not tan well on my feet so I bought this to blend with my tan and cover those spots some but it didn&#x27;t really work.  It is a very dark tan and looks natural but, still cakes up in spots where you need a little more coverage.  Not as natural as I had hoped.  Doesn&#x27;t streak but  not as smooth as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, you def get that instant bronze.&lt;br /&gt;no patches, smells like coconut, and makes you have that summer glow!&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Get compliments on my tan! It is totally even and looks natural. I usually apply twice a week to keep color</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! It works really well. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like that nasty chemically smell that some self tanners do. Goes on even and stays for a few days. People think it&#x27;s a real tan on me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! The mitt it comes with to apply the product really helps to make your tan flawless and not streaky. I also love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner odor. Does not look orange either. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t streak or look blotchy, smells great, and NO orange color at all! I&#x27;m pretty pale and had no issues with this. This is much better than Jergens. It does fade a little bit but not anything too major. I use this on my face as well. I put it on on night after showering. It does have somewhat of a typical self-tanner smell the next day, but only slightly and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It has a color guard as well so you can see where you put it. Definitely use this in the bathroom as it is a spray and can get on things. Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I&#x27;m surprised at all the wonderful reviews given by fair-skinned people saying it&#x27;s bronze and not orange-y. It honestly looks very much like other tanning products, I felt, and even though I exfoliated and followed directions to lotion up around the knees and rough patches, it still grabbed there. When it started to fade away, it seemed to just grab to my pores and those rough patches -- leaving me straight up orange when I decided to wean off the product. It isn&#x27;t as orange-y as other products I&#x27;ve tried, but nothing to scream and rant and rave about. I didn&#x27;t dare put it on my face -- thank goodness (after seeing what it did to my knees.) I recommend just NOT using it on your elbows or knees, or just EVER so stinking lightly. I was SO careful just to use it super sparingly and just pass over the knees and elbows to avoid staining and it STILL did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very difficult not to get all over -- wherever the mist landed stained my white bathroom counters if left more than a couple seconds. It&#x27;s hard to be cleaning and applying this at the same time.. There are still drip marks down my bathroom sink and the bottle happened to drip on my arm, which (even wiping it away immediately) left me with a handful of dark drip stains on my arm. Yippee.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t think it was as jaw-dropping as everyone else made it out to be. I did like that the mitt was offered, but wash it in between uses. ABSOLUTELY use a plastic glove under the mitt. Other reviewers are right -- snip the spray tube before trying to use it because it&#x27;s far too long and will make the bottle leak. I won&#x27;t bash the product, but it&#x27;s not impervious to the drawbacks one would experience with other products. I used it according to directions and even though other raving reviewers chalk up dissatisfaction to \\&quot;not using it correctly,\\&quot; I think it depends on the customer&#x27;s body and skin tone. I think it is a GOOD product, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I seriously LOVE this self tanner.  I am very pale skinned, and yet have dark brown hair, so a tan really does a lot for me. This is instant, which I love, and if you go dark enough it will last about 6 days.  I usually do an all over dark on Friday evening and I am set for the weekend.  It is still some color left by Thursday which is good.  I have even applied this before and while at the beach with good results.  I am a nurse and have learned that any dark spots instantly come off with a little alcohol.  So if you ever need to reduce the color absorbed around toes or joints... just use a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball.  I have noticed that the sensitive skin on my face can break out after using this, so I have stopped using it on my face and use loreal&#x27;s sunless spray instead.  I plan on ordering fake bake&#x27;s face tanner soon to try it.</li>
            <li> As a former sun worshipper and tanning bed junkie, I am now staying away from the sun - don&#x27;t want skin cancer! I have tried at least 10 different self-tanners, spray tan at the tanning salon, Mystic Tan, Versa tan, and none of them come CLOSE to this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY easy to apply - the applicator mitt is wonderful and ensures an even application.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very tropical and coconutty - like sun tan oil, and does not have that foul \\&quot;self tanner smell\\&quot;. It does have a bronzer in it to assist with application and give you instant color. The bronzer part will wash off, but you will still have a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using this at night is best - shower, shave, exfoliate and make sure you are completely dry. Use the Fake Bake - I spray it directly on my skin AND on the mitt and buff it evenly into any part of your body that you want to tan. Then wear loose-fitting pajamas, and in the morning, wash off.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do this a few (3 or 4) nights in a row, then after that, only once or twice a week for maintenence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this on my face, but Fake Bake makes a self tanner specifically for face, and I want to try this next.</li>
            <li> I am a regular tanner. A couple years back I was in a tanning bed probably 5 days a week for 20 minutes. I loved my tan so much. I can&#x27;t seem to remember why I stopped tanning, but I did and I went back to my pasty self I was when I was a kid. Yuck! My skin started to get very dry and sensitive after I stopped tanning and I actually ended up getting really bad acne. When I did some time lining, I found out that all my acne problems started when I quit tanning. So I figured I was over the acne I&#x27;m gonna start tanning again. My acne and dry skin has gotten better but for the life of me I can&#x27;t get even 2 shades darker from tanning. I have seen this product used all over YouTube, so I decided to give it a whirl. I LOVEEEEE THIS STUFF! Best thing I have ever spent my money on. I have used all sorts of lotions, creams, sprays, gels, salon spray tans and compared to this they all suck! You can&#x27;t screw up applying this even if you tried. I was rushing through it and my tan is natural and flawless. I actually could do my feet, elbows and knees with no problems at all. Normally with other products I have a hard time wearing spaghetti straps or bras that fit a little tighter than normal because the pressure will take the tan off and then I have a embarrassing mark where the straps are. 14 hours later, I have a bra and tank top on and there are still no lines :) :). The only problem I have with this product was the packaging. The straw on the spray attachment is way to long for the bottle so naturally the screw top doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough and the bottle will actually leak. I heard about this problem before I purchased it so i went to Sally&#x27;s and picked up a generic spray bottle and poured it in there. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a natural looking fake tan, who doesn&#x27;t wanna risk their safety with a tanning bed, who wants a long lasting tan, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t wanna fork out the cash for a salon spray tan that doesn&#x27;t have the quality that thisproduct does. BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! IT&#x27;s easy to apply, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave orange streaks.  And the name FAKE BAKE is a riot!!  I would recommend this product to all my fair skinned friends!!</li>
            <li> I tried this and not even halfway through the bottle, I am done with it. It does splatter and the tan does not get deep even with multiple applications. And yes, I did all the prep work, loofad, lotioned areas that needed it, etc. but this stuff did not get me tan. I have tried Tarte and guess what, going back to it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh was a fabulous product! Great price, smells wonderful, really easy to use and looks gorgeous. It gives a more natural looking tan at first, and as you build it up you get darker and darker. Its the only self tanner I&#x27;ll use from here on out! Loce love love it!</li>
            <li> In Puerto Vallarta I wanted to look &#x27;poolish&#x27;, not pale and foolish.  This product works the best of any I&#x27;ve tried. Tan it up and flaunt it out there.</li>
            <li> I really really like the color of the tan that I am able to get with this product.  It IS messy.  I decided that after I originally got it all over the bathroom room, that maybe I would try it again in the shower (easier to cleanup).  This worked better lol!  Everything went on nicely with the mit except for my upper thigh area...just didn&#x27;t rub it in enough.  Other than that, I think this is a terrific product and really enjoy the whole line that FakeBake has.  I get a lot of compliments on the tan, for sure.  It is so nice not walking around looking orangey, like other products tend to leave you with.  Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this fake bake flawless. I used it as soon as I recieved it. I followed the directions and sprayed it directly on the mitt provided. It went on very evenly and easy. One spray goes a long way! I noticed a pretty glowing tan instantly! It really does glow. I used to pay $60 to go to the tanning salon and go in the \\&quot;Versa spa\\&quot; tan machine. It smelled horrible and was super exspensive. Fake bake actually smells good! One it dries it has a very slight self tanner smell. But Barely. I am pretty pale and I do not get tans easily. But with fake bake, I look like I have a natural glowing tan. It is not orange AT ALL. It looks so natural. I am glad I bought 2 bottles of this stuff. It should last awhile. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this...GET IT.</li>
            <li> Pros-The mitten used for putting on the tanner made it easier to apply and get ride of streaks. The picture doesn&#x27;t show it but it also comes with two rubber gloves which protect your hands from getting tanning stained. I really liked the color, it is a bit intense though especially if you are wintertime white, it wasn&#x27;t orange but it was pretty dark. I also used it after a beach vacation to prolong the look my real sun tan and it looked very natural. It wasn&#x27;t streaky at all. The product said it could be used on your face, although they sell a face lotion version, and while it did work it took a bit of practice to get right of amount (a little goes a long way on the face) of tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-Still smells like sunless tanner, not as bad so some, but the smell is just unavoidable I guess.</li>
            <li> Great product! Has pleasant smell similar to Tropicana suntan lotion that has that tropical, &amp;#34;coconutty-type&amp;#34; smell. Even that dissipates after about 45 min. and then it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything...just you (which is a good thing, at least in my opinion). Goes on easy w/application mitt that&#x27;s included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t look fake. Also takes very little per application so it will go along way for me. I will definitely continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to apply, no streaking, no unevenness! Smells great when it goes on, but the color guard smells a little bad. Wash that off and you&#x27;re good to go. I apply on Monday and it wears off by Saturday so it&#x27;s pretty great for a home self tanner. I&#x27;ve purchased this twice already and I will definitely purchase again. Lasts me about 2-3 months</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I absolutely love this stuff I recommended it to my mother who has now purchased her first bottle</li>
            <li> Ladies- Exfoliating is EASY! Go buy a sugar scrub from Walmart or Target- THATS ALL! Then dry off &amp; apply this! YES YES YES I use it on my face as well! Its natural looking, no annoying fake tan smell, no streak problems, its not orange, and it does NOT wash off! So you can go swimming and it will stay on! If you slow down how often you use it, then it will eventually start to fade- I just use mine on the weekends for now. Do like the directions say- bend knees and elbows when applying to those areas! I just walk around the house naked for awhile to make sure its 1,000 percent dry before I apply my clothes! And also like the directions say- do this before you go to bed and sleep with the tan on! As for the mit it comes with- I wash it in hot water and then lay it out to dry! (I heard washing machines &amp; dryers mess the mitts up) Its perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. It works really well not to turn you orange while giving you a tan gradually so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I really wish you got a bigger bottle. 8oz. bottle would be perfect. The color isnt as dark as I thought it would be... Just a nice glowy look. It pretty much washes off in the shower. After showering I looked pretty white. I guess you have to put on a few coats. It gives a really good color though. Doesnt smell bad either!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it wears off pretty quickly! Love the color it gives me! Love that I can see where I am putting it! Love the mit and how flawlessly it goes on. The smell is good, no harsh tanning lotion smell. I will never use another self tanner again-this one is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have used several self-tanners. This product, with the color indicator, is an excellent self-tanner. I followed the directions on the package and recommendations of other reviewers: exfoliation, blending balm, gloves &amp; mit (they come with FakeBake Flawless), and I use Malibu Hemp Firming Lotion with gradual tanner in it- daily(Walmart). I recommend using this product at night before bed. The color indicator (and most of the smell) will shower off in the morning. My results have been very good. I wish that I could get an even darker tan. I have even applied the product twice within 24 hours. My natural color is fair to medium. I tan easily in the sunlight. It does have a fake tan smell and the color indicator will fade onto your sheets and clothing(before showering). However, it is a small sacrifice if you want a tan without the risk of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I saw a really good review in a magazine on this product as &amp;#34;one of the best tried&amp;#34; so decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to put on and looks pretty good.  You have to be careful around  your feet/ankles. and make sure you don&#x27;t miss spots.  I applies it right after I showered.  It says not to put on any moisturizer before applying.  It dried quickly and then I applied a 2nd coat the next morning.  I took a shower late that night after working in the yard and saw &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; in the water as I showered.  Not too much of the color came off.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and will probably continue with it for this summer.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and the applicator glove that goes with it. I just wish it stayed on longer. Otherwise a great product with a natural color</li>
            <li> I love the original fake bake but thought I would try this out. It&#x27;s not at all as easy to apply as the original fake bake. I will stick to the original from now on.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Easy to apply..... Looks very natural. Just make sure you shave first and exfoliate.... Don&#x27;t ever do fake tan in a hurry...take your time and do it with plenty of advanced notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many fake tanners before and usually they smell awful and leave me looking orange, not fake bake! The rave reviews about this product are spot on. If you&#x27;re looking to take a leap of faith on a sunless tanner this is the one. It comes with a mitten and some gloves to help apply the tanner. A couple of sprays on the mitt and you just rub the tanner on your body. You should leave it on for 4-6 hours as per the directions. Once the tanner is applied you&#x27;ll look as if like you just came back from vacationing somewhere tropical. Later when you shower it off you&#x27;ll still have some color but not as dark as you originally applied it. I&#x27;m planning to just apply the tanner every other day. By the way I&#x27;m ridiculously white, Irish girl here, my skin is very pale, you will not look like an oompa loompa using fake bake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few sunless tanners and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  I&#x27;m an experienced self tanner and didn&#x27;t experience any streaking but I feel like even someone who doesnt know what they&#x27;re doing might.  Less is more.  Don&#x27;t do anymore then a thin layer.  If you want darker, wait until the next day.  Wait 15 minutes after it dries then apply lotion, it wont mess it up but will ensure that it stays even and your skin wont dry up.</li>
            <li> I really like the result from this tanner, doesn&#x27;t fade patchy and it&#x27;s almost fool proof. The mitt works well at applying the tanner with one caveat. It is very difficult to keep the mitt on your hand during use. It really needs a wrist banding sewed onto the mitt to keep it from pulling off. I am going to try a rubber band the next time I use it, but I predict it won&#x27;t work that well because the mitt is a little short...we&#x27;ll see. Two other things I&#x27;m not \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; about; the smell SOMETIMES even after showering and it doesn&#x27;t look that great on my face. A little unnatural.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Very natural-looking, forgiving if you put it on a little unevenly, and smells great. I always get compliments on my colouring now. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pale and live in the east coast so tanning is not much of an option come summer time and it takes a long time for me to get tan. I have tried tan towels, banana boat, lorel tan spray, lorel tan lotion and numerous drug store tanning lotions. Everything i&#x27;ve tried would leave me real streaky, not bad color, but the streaking was just way too embarrassing. I heard from a friend that this product works and she lives in FL so i knew i had to give it a try. I put it on last night and when i applied you can easily tell where it&#x27;s been applied so its real easy to keep track. the mit makes it very convenient, but i did forget to wear the rubber gloves they provide with it and my fingers were like black, but i put alcohol on them and cleared them up this morning. The only complaint which was pretty popular based on other reviews is that the bottle does leak but its easy to clean up. I am VERY impressed with the color and the non-streak that I have, I have never been so happy with a self tanner. My friends at work thought I went and got sprayed at a local tanning salon ($50). I read that some color will come off when I shower later on today so depending how much comes off I will reapply and see how long the color lasts. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with the color and non-streaking AND this is the first product that does NOT SMELL!!!! It did not come off my in my sheets last night and stink everything up, I am so impressed... I will be purchasing this product again for sure!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased Fake Bake Flawless about a week ago off Amazon and just received it yesterday. I exfoliated and then put it on before bed last night. I woke up with a beautiful golden tan. The shade is a bit lighter than other self tanners that I have used but it looks SO much more natural! My boyfriend usually complains when I use self tanner because of the DHA smell and he thinks it looks unnatural. He actually commented this morning that he did not smell anything at all and that it looks super natural, like I just got back from vacation. If you want a really dark tan you can build it and use it a couple days in a row. But the shade of my skin right now looks so natural and the mitt it comes makes blending so easy and eliminates any streaking. I love it and am so happy I got this just before summer starts so I can look bronzed without risking the sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDE:  The only downside which I have seen in other reviews is the leaking spray top!!! I cut a bit more than an inch off of the straw part as recommended in other reviews to prevent the leaking.  But this did not solve the problem.  When I push the button down, liquid also seeps out around the perimeter of the spray top.  I even measured the straw up next to the side of the bottle to make sure it was cut short enough.  If anyone has any tips please let me know!!! It is such a drag when I have already done my legs, and I am up to spraying my arms and it leaks and then drops on my already-blended legs.  Help!!!</li>
            <li> I have been self tanning for a long time ...my favorite for the past fews years has been Bare Essentials ...but it does have alingering smell but you get a great tan . UNTIL i tried this !!!! OH MY it smells amazing....applys like a dream with the MIT ! ANd no lingering smell...none ...not later not the next day !!! The tan is gradual yet you can def see after the first application....my neighbor at work noticed my tan and asked ...and she ordered it right away ! This is a great self tanner and way way cheaper than the others !</li>
            <li> Your friends will think your face took a vacation.</li>
            <li> 3 stars mostly for the mitt. I&#x27;m obsessed with it and may purchase this tanner just to get another mitt! The tanner itself is ok but once it starts to fade it was a tad orangish</li>
            <li> I am so fair skinned and have skin cancer also and this stuff is GREAT!!!  Not only does it look good it is so easy to use LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great sunless tanner!  It turns your skin instantly darker and stays on for around 3-days with showering.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Have been using for 2 years and I won&#x27;t change to anything else!! I always get compliments on my &amp;#34;fake bake&amp;#34; tan!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner! It is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I definitely recommend this to family and friends. It may look streaky after you first apply it but once you sleep on it and shower the next morning, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it&#x27;s amazing! Received my product in good time, and the product never lets me down! The mitt makes everything blend in so easily, and if you are nervous about it, there are many videos on YouTube that show you how to apply.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! So much that I&#x27;ve purchased for other items of this brand! It&#x27;s not super blotchy, it&#x27;s not oiley, it&#x27;s not orange looking and smells fantastic... Do me a favor sand get this brand! They have they&#x27;re product figured out right!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but am not in love with it. First, being very fair skinned, I have to apply every night for 4-5 days to achieve my desired color. Second, it is messy. I would definitely recommend covering your floor with towels before using. I spray the product directly onto my skin (instead of onto the mitt), which I find to be more effective, but it gets EVERYWHERE. You won&#x27;t really notice that its everywhere until you clean your bathroom...lol...but seriously, stained linoleum and toilet seats aren&#x27;t funny, especially when you&#x27;re renting!  Lastly, it does rub off onto white sheets and light colored clothing occasionally (and the towels you lay down before application will look ruined), but WILL wash out. The smell is much better than most self-tanners, but it does become obnoxious after several hours. On the bright side, the color looks very natural and streak-free (thanks to the blending mitt and color guide mixed in). After you achieve your desired color, it will last several days before needed to re-apply. To prolong and accentuate your &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; I would recommend using a gradual tinted moisturizer (like Designer Skin) in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells great. Easy to use. I love that a mitt is included. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly impress on how easy and no \\&quot;orange\\&quot; look I got with only one application. I got it last week..used it Monday then Thursday for retouch on Saturday when I wore my little black dress I looked amazing. I&#x27;m not one of those girls that brags and talks about herself...well once in a while &#x3D;) but this product does speak for itself You will look amazing with a great tan. I&#x27;m now a new fanatic on using Fake Bake Flawless tanning lotion no doubt about it. YouTube had great demo on this product so it made it very easy to apply and get a great tan look with only few minutes before going to bed. The next morning if you do have spots that you missed retuch and you are set to go.</li>
            <li> I really was happy with the performance of this product. The color tome was good, gave me a tan that was not too dark, and with careful application it does not streak! However, the bottle does leak. I had to travel for wedding, and I took the advise of other users when I received it and cut the pump tube down to the appropriate length for the bottle. They must need to improve the top, perhaps some form of gasket to seal it better. Otherwise- good product!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and this product gave me a very natural looking tan. People keep asking me where I have been to get such a great looking tan.</li>
            <li> The BEST self tanner i have ever used. I have purchased every brand from the very highest end to the lowest. This product does not stain my clothes or my bedding, smells pretty good and i do not look orange and do not have any streaks. Looks very natural! If you are looking for a self tanner, look no more!!!! I highly reccommend Fake Bake and this seller whom i purchased from shipped extremley quick so i am very happy all the way aroud!!</li>
            <li> I simply love this stuff. I&#x27;m fair and don&#x27;t tan easily (yes, they used to call me \\&quot;Casper\\&quot; in high school) so you can imagine that I&#x27;m a little self-conscious about living in San Diego without a hint of the sun&#x27;s rays. I enjoy wearing dresses to work and this has helped my pasty legs tremendously. I like how it takes less than 5 minutes to apply (I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs thus far), dries super fast with a pleasant coconut smell. I can wear the \\&quot;tan\\&quot; right away with the color guide, if you will, so I don&#x27;t need to wait 4 hours until it shows up. Since I&#x27;m so pale, I can put one application on and I&#x27;m good to go for a couple of days. No streaks and the color looks completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, after a few hours the tropical scent wears off and turns into what I call a \\&quot;cornflake\\&quot; scent. Not a dealbreaker but I also noticed the same smell with the Jergen&#x27;s gradual tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: this is a weekly staple for my summer outfit.</li>
            <li> So this is my first self tanner I have ever purchased and used. Going into it I was VERY scared of turning really orange, messing up, etc. I looked around on the internet for hours before I finally decided to pick up the Fake Bake Flawless, and I so far really love it! (been using for almost a month now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice color, if I wanted to have a sun kissed look I would not spray much on, if I wanted a bronzed look I would spray more (for example for a sunkissed look I would do maybe about 4 sprays on each arm, if I want a more bronzed look I would do 6 sprays)&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice smell while applying, and doesn&#x27;t smell TOO bad after the 8 hours after it&#x27;s done processing&lt;br /&gt;4. Fades off nicely, doesn&#x27;t fade off in patches&lt;br /&gt;5. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes (at least it hasn&#x27;t yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somethings I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. While the smell isn&#x27;t too bad, the smell will transfer onto your clothes (alot) Also if you are going to have any skin exposed when you go to bed, sleep on a blanket or a separate sheet. I slept in a strapless short dress the first time I used it, when I woke up my sheets smelt like the fake tan pretty badly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not a huge fan of the mitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think if you are wanting to try self tanner, then this would be a good start! I have gotten alot of complements on how I look like I have been getting out in the sun (which I have not), and my color looks nice (everyone thinks it&#x27;s from being out in the sun! No one has asked if I use fake tan, yay!) If you are like me and are worried about trying fake tan and then it looking horrible or you messing up, just remember it&#x27;s not permanent! ALSO if you are REALLY worried, just buy some fake tan remover along with the fake tan! So then if you hate the color on you, you can remove it (or just scrub it off) I am so glad I finally tried this stuff! Will continue to use it (:</li>
            <li> This was so much better than I expected having never used a self tanner. I don&#x27;t like anything that feels greasy so I was unsure when I ordered it but it was not greasy at all. The application is very easy. Make sure you don&#x27;t use lotions or oils before applying. This helps the product to soak into the skin and for me it last about a week and is just the right color without looking fake. When it rinses off in the shower the next morning, a little of the excess washes off but doesn&#x27;t affect the color. Great Product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on great, smells like coconuts.  Hint; cut off about 3/4 inch of spray tube so that it fits better in the bottle and you will not have any leaking!  Also, this is not meant to be used upside down to spray, if you do that it will come out &amp;#34;spitting&amp;#34;, which you will instantly have to rub in or you will get splotches. I do the usual shower, exfoliate, dry, wait at least an hour after shower so you are really dry.  Remember to use a small amount of lotion, (not like you would normally moisturize) on heels, ankle bones, knees and elbows so that these areas do not get overly dark!!! Start at feet and work your way up. I spray on the mitt and rub in circles lightly over toes, and then harder on my legs.  Apply spray as needed to the mitt and rub in.  This product makes you instantly darker so you can see where you would need more spray. Continue rubbing in circles everywhere you want to be tan.  Unless you are double-jointed or have long arms, you will need someone to do you back. I also use this on my face, but since there is usually quite a bit of product on the mitt, there is no need to spray more.  Girls, if you wear you hair up, make sure to apply this to the sides and back of your neck and outsides of ears!  FYI Guys.. I didn&#x27;t originally buy this thinking my husband would even want to use this product as he was talking about going to a tanning salon...boy was I wrong.  My husband is a very fair person, with pasty white skin and especially his legs.  He doesn&#x27;t tan, HE BURNS!.  He has tried other products and they always left him orange and any age or darker spots, (he is 57 yrs old) on his legs were made even darker, NOT THIS PRODUCT.  I originally bought two 12 oz bottles, (didn&#x27;t know if I would like it but the reviews were very favorably) and we have both been using it approximately 3-4 times a week since early April and are into the second bottle, but there is about 2/3 left.  So I say between the both of us a bottle will last a month or so.  ALSO...FYI. I opened the second bottle and it came with a set of the blue gloves, and a mitt but no sprayer so make sure you keep the sprayer.  I wash the mitt every 3-4 uses, let dry in the sun, (just put by window not necessarily outside and it drys fast), and then soften the mitt again before use with a soft brush like a toothbrush or a nail scrubbing brush, not real hard just for a bit to make the mitt soft again so that the tanning product goes on smooth.  It is now May 13, and I&#x27;m getting ready to order again to carry us thru summer. Needless to say, we both love this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and will keep using it.  FYI...I used this in the morning, let dry and then went about my day.  Later in the day, while washing dishes and splashing water on my arms, the initial tan color was washing off making my arms splotchy looking.  (NOT THE TAN ITSELF).  I just took so paper towel and wiped on my arms to get the rest of the initial color dried off and everything was fine.  My tan was still there, it was just the initial color that had washed off.  Hence the reason the directions say spray at night and take a (VERY LIGHT) shower in the morning and pat, NOT RUB, yourself dry.  When you take a shower after applying this product, (WAIT OVERNIGHT OR AT LEAST 12 HOURS) what you see coming off is the initial guide color of the tan, the actual tan product has had a chance to activate and you will still have a tan, maybe somewhat lighter, but still tan.  I have had no other problems with this product.  Apply two coats initially if you would like, no problem.  This product is very flexible and we love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, just started using it, but am VERY PLEASED with the results, AND it&#x27;s stupid simple to apply.  Caution:  overspray...........so spray your mitt over a sink or tub.  CAUTION:  if you have a French manicure, be sure to wear enclosed rubber gloves, it will turn your tips brown!  It&#x27;s so much easier to apply than the lotions or wipes, because you can pretty much see what and where it&#x27;s going at the time of application, you don&#x27;t get that next morning wake-up surprise, strips down your legs!  I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts, but I really like it, and it looks very natural.  I read that the mitt gets kinda stiff and gooy, so I&#x27;ve been washing mine out after every 2 applications.  I&#x27;m really liking this, and would definitely refer and buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be the best subless tanning product I have ever used. Easy to apply and looks great and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I just applied it this morning and waited 8 hours to shower. I didn&#x27;t apply it very heavy but so far the color looks ok and pretty natural. I plan to reapply again tomorrow to see if I can make it darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did watch some videos on how to apply it which were really helpful for getting even color and to avoid streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviews say it doesn&#x27;t have that self tanner smell. For the first 2 hours, it smelled like it&#x27;s fragrance. After the 2 hours, it definitely has that self tanner smell. I&#x27;m glad I did this on a day I was home all day because by the time I was ready to take a shower, I stank. And so did my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update on again on the progress of color after a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  So I&#x27;ve tried this a few times now. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely smells like any other tanner. And even worse, it still smelled more than 24 hours and 2 showers later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide color looks better than the tan. Indoors, the final color doesn&#x27;t look too too bad - but in sunlight it is definitely orangey yellow. My arms don&#x27;t look as bad because they are naturally darker, but anywhere else has a weird unnatural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is messy. Even if you are careful spraying it, it still sort of &amp;#34;mists&amp;#34; all over the bathroom. I noticed my cleaning cloth was this sort of pinkish brown color when I was cleaning my bathroom. And the mitt is cheap. It fuzzes up and makes a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m not happy and will continue my search for a more natural tanner. I returned this one.</li>
            <li> follow directions as written and it works. really like the color and new look it gives me. will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old with skin that has been weather in Florida for well......52 years.  I&#x27;m naturally light skinned (European decent) so a little extra tan helps hide the sun spots and imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with the good characteristics. This product has a pigment in it that allows you to see where you have applied.  I&#x27;ve had no problem getting it evenly distributed.  Other products that I have tried leave you guessing until the next day.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product staining sheets, shirts, or any other clothing.  You will get some of the dye rinsing off in the shower though.  Because the consistency of this product is like water, they don&#x27;t have the cost of mixing in a cream or other base material.  Meaning that the cost for this product is better than most.  It also comes with a pair of rubber gloves, and a mitt to install it.  Unlike other mitts that I&#x27;ve used, this one will allow the product to easily seep through so you need to use the rubber gloves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad characteristics.  Because the product is like spraying water, it is messy.  If you apply this in the shower then rinsing it down (cleaning up) is not a big deal.  Another complaint that others have commented, it comes from the manufacture with the tube being too long for the bottle so it causes it to leak at times.  I cut about 3/4&amp;#34; off of it and I&#x27;ve had no problems.  The rubber gloves typically tear before I finish the bottle so I purchased a back up pair of gloves. I have large hands so this might not be a problem to most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get about 6 applications per bottle.  each application last a little less than a week (depends on how often your skin exfoliates).  To apply this to your back  you&#x27;ll need to purchase a back applicator.  I&#x27;ve used one similar to &amp;#34;Body Buddy Non Absorbent Lotion Applicator&amp;#34; that cost about $20.  Even with a good applicator, it will make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would give the quality of the tanning results and overall cost 5-stars.  I would give the easy of application 3-stars.  So my overall rating was 4-stars.  I plan to purchase more since I like the end results and this product cost less then most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic and have yellow undertones, I can get pretty pasty with no tan, I just started using self tanners this summer, and this was the 2nd brand that I have tried, first of all the box, the mitt  look in no way cheap, but I paid so little for this I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, the reviews on here were great, so I thought how can I go wrong?, To my surprise it was all I ever wanted and more, the smell is very mild and has a sort of tropical smell to it but not overpowering, I love the spray, I just have to work fast and rub from top to bottom, it does dry very fast, I got a golden glow from this tanner almost instantly, I am totally addicted, i do have to do it at least 3 times a week for my glow to stay, oh and before I forget I do my face as well with the mitt and I can see the color immediately! but I&#x27;m so thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to tan for hours to get a glow!! now I can have it year round and for such a great price!!</li>
            <li> Great natural bronzed look without streaking.  Smell is better than other drug store brands that I&#x27;ve tried - although there is an eventual tanning product smell after using.</li>
            <li> The application was the only thing I loved about this (LOVE the mitt!) I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it leaking, it sprayed on easy and smelled nice.  It was virtually streak free. However the color was almost a too light/orange shade. I REALLY liked the deep brown color before the color guard was washed off. Was super sad after shower. Seemed alright indoors, but in the sun I thought &amp;#34;Holy jeez, I&#x27;m seriously orange!&amp;#34; It also didn&#x27;t last very well and came off very splotchy! Luckily, it was so easy to remove the rest of the color it didn&#x27;t really matter. Of course then I was left with no tan. Tried it a couple times to be sure, but I&#x27;m very unimpressed. Really wanted to love this product!</li>
            <li> It will give you a nice tan, but the smell is terrible. I would never leave the house smelling the way this product smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best self-tanner i have used so far, i prefer it over st-tropez and many others...i think the color left is beautiful and it does not streak!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Fake Bake because it is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever come across. It smells amazing, gives you an absolutely gorgeous color/glow, and is easy to use. Now, when I say &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34;, self tanners aren&#x27;t exactly rocket science but they can be a huge pain to apply. Fake Bake goes on streak free, it has color guard so you can tell where you already applied it. It already comes with a mitt and gloves but even without the gloves, just throw some lotion on your hands and anything that gets through the mitt will wash off. I&#x27;m super hyped to try Fake Bake Darker &amp; continue using this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was very skeptical about trying any tanning products but after reading and hearing rave reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since the price is more than reasonable. I applied it two times, as instructed and I was extremely happy with the results. I just wish I kept up with it more! The color is instant, gradual and natural looking. I haven&#x27;t noticed and streaking or peeling. Overall I am happy with this purchase and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> love the smell and color easy application. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with the Fake Bake Flawless product. This is by far the best sunless tanning product out there, no question. I get compliments all the time and my friends are now using it too!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all.  The ones from stores that leave streaks or make my skin turn orange. Spray cans, gels.&lt;br /&gt;This one is easy to use, works fast &amp; does not cake &amp; peel off after a couple days like the other spray on ones do.&lt;br /&gt;After just 3 days I was able to darken 4 shades.  I am a light skin Hispanic woman, and now with this Fake Bake I have managed to gain enough color to look like I&#x27;ve been away on a cruise or something.  This stuff works great, leaves a nice golden tan that is not orange &amp; does not streak.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit washes off in the shower the first rinse after applying, but what stays behind is a golden tan that I could not be happier with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering another bottle to keep on hand when mine runs out. I will continue to use this product year round, no doubt.</li>
            <li> I swear by this it&#x27;s my ultimate go to for fake tan! Love it and for $10 OMG bargain!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanning product I have used.  The mit makes it go on so well.  It is fast drying, and the \\&quot;color\\&quot; won&#x27;t rub off on stuff while you sleep... I have left it on overnight and ran errands in early morning, and the base color does not come off til you shower..meaning the color that goes on while you are putting the product on.  This does not make me itch like all the rest of tanning products...and even better that it has no parabens!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the original Fake Bake and loved it. I wanted to try something new this time and read good reviews on the flawless. My only complaint is that its a little messy. The first  time i used it i got it all over my bathroom floor and yes, all ovet my bare feet  thank goodness after i scrubbed those babies, my over all tan looked real. Though it is messier than the original because it&#x27;s a spray, it gives a great color. The mitt blends the color into my skin for that flawless finish. I get more comments about my nice tan skin than ever before. I live in the NW where most of the year it&#x27;s rainy and gray. I&#x27;m sure people think I&#x27;m in the tanning beds a lot to maintain bronze skin but little do they know I&#x27;m doing it the \\&quot;safe way\\&quot;. The only healthy tan is a fake one and Fake Bake&#x27;d Flawless helps me achieve that. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t turn out orange. It comes out a beautiful light brown color that you can build on and it stays a far more natural shade than anything else I&#x27;ve used. It fades evenly when you want it to and doesn&#x27;t streak at all. I only experienced a little too much build up at my ankles and elbows a few times but that&#x27;s most likely due to me not exfoliating as well as I should have beforehand.</li>
            <li> Awesome color, that doesn&#x27;t look orange! Will continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and even! Like it better than my home air brush system actually faster.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Super easy to use just spray and rub and done! I look like a totally different person with a natural glow! Thank you fakebake! Amazing will tell everyone about this product!!!</li>
            <li> No orange fake looking color at all, lasts very well and does not rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> Tried it it takes alot of reapplications to get a good brown color... It doesnt have a horrible smell. Smells like tanner but is doable. Its def something buildable not a golden tan right away</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping for ( about 3 days instead of a week) but it gave me an awesome tan that was super easy to apply.  It dries really fast and smells really good for a self tanner.  I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great product that looks natural!</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted, fake bake flawless is my go to self tan. I have tried st. tropez, sun labs, and just a bunch of lotions. LIQUID IS THE WAY TO GO! So easy to blend and dries in an instant:]</li>
            <li> This product works well, but the tan Didn&#x27;t last long at all for me.  Also, the bottle leaks horribly at the point where the cap twists on.  Definitely more has leaked out than I have been able to use</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am in love with it. I am always going to the tanning beds, and pay $40 every two weeks for a tech to professionally spray me. This product is great, and I am so pleased with the results. I have olive skin, and with this, it gives me a really nice tone.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to apply. I recommend doing it right after your shower, use Pure &amp; Natural soap so there isn&#x27;t any sort of lotioney film left on your skin. If you have rough areas (knees, elbows) use a little salt scrub oil on them before you apply this product or it&#x27;ll make the areas too dark. The smell is also nice- doesn&#x27;t stink like typical self tanners. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Fake Bake lotion and loved it. I was going on a trip to Mexico and don&#x27;t like tanning in a tanning bed, so I thought I&#x27;d venture onto Fake Bake&#x27;s other tanning solutions. I came across this one and the reviews were raving about how flawless this product is. I was very disappointed. I did not feel it went on even and if anyone has ANY stretch marks, they will be extremely noticeable. I tested the product on my butt cheek (figured if it didn&#x27;t turn out, no one would see and I wanted a big enough area to work with)and I saw stretch marks I never knew I even had! The product did what it was supposed to...make me look tan, but it accentuated my flaws more than make me look better. Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for me, but I didn&#x27;t put it anywhere else on my body in fear of looking horrible.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely pale, and have history of skin cancer in my family, so I try not to use tanning beds or go out in the sun without at least an SPF 50. I have used a lot of sunless tanners over the years and was really looking forward to trying this product after reading the reviews. I did find that the product does have the classic &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell after a couple of hours, contrary to what most of the reviews said. I was very pleased with how easy it was to apply and the bronzer makes the tan look incredibly dark and easy to tell where you have not applied. I followed the directions exactly and even took the tips about cutting stem of the spray nozzle and did not have any issues with the product spilling down or around the sides. I read reviews where people said the next morning the tan washed off as soon as they showered. Although I am not as pale as before I applied the &amp;#34;Fake Bake&amp;#34; I do not have nearly the tan I thought I would. I reapplied before going to work as I didn&#x27;t see where the product had rubbed off very much on my sheets or blankets and I am wearing a loose dress. Again, with the bronzer it looks like I have a great and natural tan, however if this application does not darken I wonder if it will wash right off tonight when I shower. I bought this product to get a good base time before going to the lake this weekend for Memorial Day, I hope it can withstand me being in and out of the water all weekend. Overall I was pleased with the ease of the application process, how quickly it dries and though the tan is not intensely dark, it does look natural and it did not streak at all. I am disappointed with the darkness of the tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and this is the best bronzing product out there.  Natural looking, long-lasting tan compared to the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Love the product , but will never buy it online again.  Bought 2, received 1 , called to see where #2 was and they resent, but there was a problem with my zip code.  Funny the first one got there with no problem at all .  Not sure how they missed to pack 2 the first time round. Both could have fit in the package together and saved on postage.  I was pretty steamed!!</li>
            <li> I did not use this, but my boyfriend did.  It looks great, and it applies evenly.  So far from everyone I have seen use self-tanning, this one looks the best.  The color looks natural and not orange-looking.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is almost one of the best I have used thus far. I have red hair and very pale skin. The color is natural looking and not orange. When you first put the tanner on it is dark in color and applies evenly. The only complaint I have is when you shower the next morning a lot of the color does wash off. When you first apply it the smell is not intense but after sleeping in it over night it is smelly. This is typical of most self tanners I have used though.</li>
            <li> Thw absolute worst fake tan ever streaking and dye smears everwhere!&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this tanner  at all it took days to get off me and it was a mess.HGBakker</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. No streaks, drys quickly, and natural color.</li>
            <li> Loved this product when I first received and used it, but it fades way to quickly. I am very fair skinned. The color is very realistic, but I found myself having to apply it every other day to maintain a descent tan.</li>
            <li> This product is a really good tanning spray! It works and looks natural for sure. I have also bought it for my sister-in-law, brother and Mother. They all love it as well!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my fair skin.  Best to use at night then wash off the coloring that is used to guide during application the following morning.  Must exfoliate well prior as with any self tanner.  No bad smell, nice natural brownish color. It can be a little too dark if I apply too much.  One even coat is plenty.  I find it best to spray it directly on my skin however, a couple sprays at a time, then rub it in with the mitt.  Seems to do better that way.  And be careful about getting overspray on your floor, clothing.  May want to mop after.</li>
            <li> This stuff is literally amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I saw some videos on YouTube that made me want to get it, (so glad I did)&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many self tanners that have all rubbed off on my clothes or came off in the shower or just stunk really bad, and I finally found this one that smells really good applying it and hours after, it dried very fast and did not streak me or come off on my clothes or in the shower it&#x27;s long lasting and will make u want to cancel you&#x27;re tanning membership. It don&#x27;t turn u orange looking it gives u a deep sun kissed tan an looks great! Everyone has been asking me how often I tan or where I tan at and they are shocked! When I tell them I self tan. I ordered this obviously from amazon! And I did one day shipping and it was here on time and price was very reasonable . Thank you amazon! And this is a must buy for anyone that wants a nice tan from a effortless bottle :)</li>
            <li> Works just as it says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon before, and also have never used self tanner before until I bought this last week. I am so pleased with fakebake that I knew I had to write a review. I spend a fair amount of time outside, in Florida, and have never been able to get a great tan. My skin just won&#x27;t hold the tan, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to start my summer with a tan. I used this in the evening after watching some YouTube reviews (I&#x27;m new to this!) and had zero problems with application. It was easy, it smells good when you put it on, I wore the gloves, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t when he did my back and it stained his hand, so I would suggest using the gloves under the mitt. I waited until the next morning to take a shower, and it did stain my clothes, but I wore old clothes (the videos said it would so I was prepared) but it didn&#x27;t stain the sheets. I took a shower in the morning and the excess washed off and left behind a beautiful tan. Doesn&#x27;t look orange, doesn&#x27;t streak, looks like a great tan. I would also suggest exfoliating your skin first! I would 100% suggest this, and will keep using it! Happy summer!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well...I like the color.  After first shower, it was patchy in some areas, but that could have been my fault for how I applied it.  Overall, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Even color and easy application!</li>
            <li> great prodct I use to sale this in my salon for much more very happy with this product its great</li>
            <li> I was told how great this was.. Unfortunately it made me look orange and it is so easy to mess this up and end up looking streaky. Will not repurchase</li>
            <li> I typically rely on the reviews when choosing between products. In this case, while the reviews were great, I was still skeptical. Based on the reviews I expected a product without that weird sunless tan odor that was easy to apply and resulted in a natural looking tan.  After trying the product, I can confirm that this is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. There was minimal scent and the scent that was there was actually nice. It didn&#x27;t develop a weird smell after application either. It did not rub off onto clothing during my workout the next morning. The color that developed was very natural looking (I used it primarily to add color to my upper arms to eliminate a semi-farmers tan). My friends could not tell it was a fake tan -- not even a hint of orange! The application process was very easy as the tanner comes with a mitt and is tinted.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my engagement shoot when I didn&#x27;t have the time or desire to bed tan. I purchased it on a whim and used it the night before our shoot (probably a bad idea). I was really impressed with how natural it looked and it looked great in pictures. I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t have any problems with drips or streaks (I worked in a tanning salon in college so I know how bad some sunless tanning products can be!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m knocking one star off is because it turned my hands orange! Not even my palms, it turned the backs of my hands orange. My (now-husband) jokingly called me pumpkin hands for the rest of the day, but luckily it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable in the pictures. I applied it the same way that I did everywhere else, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was just a fluke, but I definitely won&#x27;t use it on my hands again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. BEAUTIFUL color. It&#x27;s instant &amp; basically fool proof. Only down side is, if you get it wet, it shows. So either don&#x27;t get wet or shower after it&#x27;s been on for however long the directions say. It will rub off on clothes, but it always washes out.</li>
            <li> Love this! Natural looking tan with no streaks! An incredible price too!</li>
            <li> The most natural fake tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Great color! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try for a while and I was very impressed with color ....no streaking!</li>
            <li> Good tanner.  Would be 4 stars if the mitt was lined so that the product didn&#x27;t bleed through while you were applying the tanner and stain your hands.</li>
            <li> This is great if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a spray tan. It tends to wash off a little lighter than I prefer, but it is still a great product. This is great for winter to give a little color without going overboard. It is very easy to apply and I love the fact that I can see where it is going while putting it on.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and the color is natural and pretty.  It does give a legit tan that lasts about a week.  Smell kinda like accelerator, but overall pretty nice.  I used this with balm that I rubbed on my knees and elbows to help keep those areas even.</li>
            <li> The best tanner I have found so far in that price range! I do not even use an special exfoliator. I coat feet, hands and rough patches on my knees with moisturizer prior to Fake Bake to achieve perfect results. This was my fourth reorder.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! It looks SO natural, and so affordable!</li>
            <li> I use this product on a weekly basis.  I squirt it on my hands, apply it to my face and it looks really good.  I wash my hands and then repeat, putting it on my arms or legs.  You do not have to be tan and it does make it look like you have a nice color to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Most of the other sunless products that I have used, turn my skin a blotchy brown, orange color. Fake Bake Flawless leaves me with a nice, natural looking tan, especially with the mitten that comes with it</li>
            <li> Always a great product.... And super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I tan everywhere but my darn legs. I have to have a little help with those. I was happy with how easy this is to apply.I haven&#x27;t had any streaks and it is a natural looking tan. Just be sure to always exfoliate and dry your legs before you apply. It&#x27;s best to apply overnight. Rinse off the color guard in the morning so you don&#x27;t stain any clothing that day. And then you are golden! Literally. And it lasts a good week or until I do another exfoliate and shave again. Then I just apply another coat. I am usually a very fair skinned person but I do lay out regularly (I live in the desert with a very extended summer) so I can&#x27;t vouch for how this would work for people who are very pale who do not also sun bathe at least a little.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves a natural looking tan and is easy to apply. Dries quickly too!!!</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this self tanner but was left disappointed. This self tanner washes off so quickly, I would say in about 2-3 days; and it is quite orange against my extremely pale skin. Maybe it would work better for someone who already has some color and just wants an extra boost.</li>
            <li> stuff works really well.  Be careful with how thick you apply and definitely exfoliate before applying.  Most people can&#x27;t tell that i just have sunless tanner on.  will definitely be my go to when i&#x27;m feeling pale</li>
            <li> I always use the  mitt and it produces a natural looking, non-streaky tan. One bottle lasts for months.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is bomb. Smells good and looks real. I apply it in the shower like a make shift spray booth and just spray the walls down when I&#x27;m done. First time my white but has ever had color</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. Can&#x27;t wait to try the &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; after I run out</li>
            <li> This tanning spray is great! It make me look REALLY dark and it was a nice looking tan but you have to rub it in really good or you&#x27;ll get lines and the reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c when it starts fading and wearing away it looks blotchy and very fake so you either need to add more or scrub it off, and it is not easy to get off but all in all I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Box was busted and item was all leaked out upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews on this product and figured I would try it out cause I want to stop tanning in tanning beds. Its a great quick self tanner with very easy application. It does streak though if not properly rubbed in. I advise everyone to exfoliate before hand cause that can be the reason it streaks as well. It was quite a lot darker on my hands and face so next time I&#x27;m only gonna apply a tiny bit. All in all i was pretty pleased with my results. Way better than a spray tan! Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange at all. Gave me a very nice light brown skin color and I have pretty fair skin in winter. I would likely buy this again for a quick tanner!</li>
            <li> I used this product the night before the Kentucky Derby and truly looked bronze the next day. No splotch or orange tint, it was perfect and super easy to apply! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this often. You must be careful not to get smears, but it is a realistic color of reddish &amp;#34;tan,&amp;#34; not orange. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this color, it&#x27;s not orange at all. It only last about 3-4 days at the most, but I have to put it on about 3-4 days in a row just to get it to last that long and keep the color that I want. Afterward, I look like I have just been at the beach. You definitely have to put it on before bed and wash it off in the morning because you have to leave it on for about 6 hours to get any color. It is a really nice product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I am very fair skinned and every time I try and go out in the sun to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; all I do is burn which eventually turns to a blotchy tan and then my skin starts to peel and the tan goes away, so I NEVER get a nice golden tan. Plus I know how bad the sun is for you, so I decided to try this after reading some of all the great reviews. It&#x27;s VERY easy to apply and goes on evenly. I had a little problem at first, but I learned quickly how to apply it, it just takes practice like anything. I didn&#x27;t know if I should try to do my face or not, but I did try it and I just used the extra that was on the mitt after I put it on my arms and a little is all you need on your face otherwise it looks to unnatural. The first time I used this, I went to work the next day and everyone was complimenting me on how great my tan looked, I just kind of laughed to myself. I love the mitt AND the rubber gloves so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your hands, that&#x27;s what I used to hate about other products. Plus it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and when you take a shower the next morning, the smell washes off. So, If you want a nice &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; golden tan and your really fair, like me, try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!   UPDATE:  I decided I don&#x27;t like this product so much after all...It washes off when you take a shower especially if you use an exfoliating body wash - then it all comes off. I joked to my husband that I can&#x27;t even keep a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tan!! Also it gets all over the sheets and your night closes if you put it on before you go to bed, which is what is recommended. The only places it doesn&#x27;t come off of like you hands and face is where it stays on! So overall, I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this product again, it just not worth the price and in order for me to keep any kind of color I have to put a ton of it on and it is expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY self tanning products over the years &amp; this is by far the best. I have even sent this product as a gift to some friends up north who have not seen sunlight in months due to this horrible winter weather. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I like the smell but otherwise it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It made me an orangeish color and was very splotchy.</li>
            <li> i just got this product yesterday and i love it. I put it on last night and instantly had a nice tan but it was also the dark color guard, woke up in the morning washed it off and it was a beautiful brown color, i added some more today love it (: deffiently will re-purchase ! btw i am naturally a little tan.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using self tanner, and this was PERFECT.  The kits comes with everything you need to get a believable tan, with my threat of being orange.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was the highest rated by users on Amazon, and had some good, in-depth reviews. I was looking for a replacement for the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze products I have used for years. I like the dark tone they provide, but it can be pretty orange and they have to be applied frequently to maintain it. They are also very thick and oily feeling, and remain sticky for quite a while after application. Reviews on Fake Bake Flawless made it sound as though they had solved all of these issues.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and mitt work very well for a quick, easy application, and I love the delicate coconut scent. It&#x27;s also nice that they include latex gloves. The spray goes on very smoothly and evenly, and dries almost immediately for a lightweight, light colored glow. Unfortunately this color is VERY light, and washes off immediately in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to use the Fake Bake Flawless spray and mitt to even out the tone of other bronzing lotions, and I like it for difficult areas like ankles, neck, and face. It is definitely not dark or long-lasting enough to use alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The included mitt disintegrates very quickly, so that it is scratchy on your skin and leaves chunky bits all over you. I still like the spray as a product, so I will not give it a lower rating, but be prepared to find alternative methods of application.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural and NO STREAKS and takes NO TIME! Its do fast and looks amazing every time. I have never had a mess up since I have had it. and I get my legs and stomach done in less than five minutes which is get nice!</li>
            <li> I use to go tanning before I had my 5 children but since having them I have not had the time to get to a tanning facility and when I did find time to go to the beach I barely got a good tan so I researched the self tanning products and found this one. It is great!! I apply mine after I shower in the morning right in the shower itself. It dries very quick and so far no staining on my clothes. It is very easy to apply and definitely gives you a natural looking tan. If you have a base already then this will just enhance your tan. Its been 2 days and still looks great!!</li>
            <li> Just typed the product name into google and on a list of sellers this was the cheapest. The product is great no mater where you buy it from, I&#x27;d pay just about any amount for it.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of dry skin, so when I applied it to my legs it was getting a little streaky. The instructions say not to put on any kind of lotion before applying, so I just got the mitt the littlest bit wet under the sink &amp; re-rubbed in the areas that were getting streaky &amp; it worked awesome. I love the color, I am also pretty white &amp; it wasn&#x27;t to dark or orange. I feel like this is more of a \\&quot;builder\\&quot; fake tan, which is really good for anyone of any skin tone. I can&#x27;t say everything about this product, because I just applied it today. So the only color I got was the base color when you first apply it. I can for sure tell that it is  staining my skin, because I can smell that \\&quot;fake tan smell\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t very strong which is good for everyone&#x27;s nose&#x27;s. All in all so far so amazing. I haven&#x27;t stepped into a tanning bed in a 2 years &amp; I was missing that golden brown tan. This has so far been the best option for an affordable non-UV tan I&#x27;ve ever came across. I highly recommend! &amp; This particular seller (123 Skincare) has the most outstanding customer service I have ever had the pleasure of being served!</li>
            <li> This product is a keeper. It looks very natural. I&#x27;ll never tan in a tanning bed again. Very happy with results</li>
            <li> I seriously cant say enough about this product. I am hooked.  I love it and I buy it religiously.  It is so easy to apply, never looks orange, never streaks and always looks natural --- and I am a spaz with this kind of stuff.  I get so many complements on how tan I look.  It even looks natural if you are super pale.  You just start out with light layers and continue layering until you get the shade you want.  The mitt  makes it almost fool proof to apply and the spray has a little tint so you can see where it has already been applied.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, so you can apply it and go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:  1. Exfoliate 2.  Make sure your skin is clean and free of all oils, I wipe down with a skin cleaning astringent, 3.Let it stay on your skin at least 12 hours before sweating or washing it off.  It seems to stay longer that way.</li>
            <li> Made my pale Irish skin look naturally tan. Easy to gradually build up the tan with this spray</li>
            <li> When I received my package the box was a little damaged, no product was leaked though. I used this so far a total of 6 times. One application doesn&#x27;t do much. Adding 2 at once(waiting until one dries and apply again) looks much better. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I was hoping. It seems as soon as I take a shower it comes off?? Also my mitt is falling apart. The velvet is coming off. I&#x27;m thinking maybe I received an old product?? It does appear very natural with no streaking at all whatsoever so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I will never run out of this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing! Instant tan! Not orange! Natural looking tan! Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Year round tan with this product. There is a darker version which I use for legs only.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m not one that needs to tan since I already have a dark complexion, but this really comes in handy when traveling in the winter months to hotter, tropical areas where my legs need a little help with evening out my skin tone. It lasts a pretty long time. I apply a couple of hours the night before I go to bed after taking a shower. It only takes an hour to completely dry and set. By the next morning when I take another shower, the coloring is still in tact but I&#x27;m still able to wash off any residue so none of the coloring gets on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand mit is really helpful to prevent streaking. This is definitely great stuff.</li>
            <li> used a spray tanner for the first time ever and this was surprisingly perfect and not orange.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I thought this one deserves a sparkling one. First of all, the package arrived amazingly fast. It goes on as a beautiful bronze gold and doesn&#x27;t streak at all. Now, of course the user has to take necessary precautions, such as showering and exfoliating. As for the reviews that say the tan washes off the next morning, I would like to debunke that right now. The color that the tan goes on as (a darker bronze) is not what your tan is meant to stay as. That is just an application color to help you not miss any spots. THAT is what washes off the next morning, not the tan. So yes, you are not as dark, but that is how it is supposed to be. It took me a couple applications to get as dark as I wanted, but of course, like everything it just took some time and experimenting with. Overall, I feel like this was more than worth my money, and if you want it to work, you have to be patient and do what it recommends in the directions for the best result!!</li>
            <li> Great for a darker solution</li>
            <li> Will not buy again. Color good but messy to apply and wears off quickly and rubs off onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> The product works best if you put small amounts on at a time to build up to your tan.  Will make knees and ankles orange if you get too much product on them.  I barely touch the mitt to these areas and I still can end up with orange spots if not careful.  I like to rub a little lotion on knee, ankle and feet areas before applying it.  Over all, product works good.</li>
            <li> Recieved item on time. product is just as described!</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; of self-tanning lotion for years. It was almost impossible to avoid the streak marks. But this product is very different. It  isn&#x27;t a lotion, but a liquid. It goes on very easily with the included hand glove. I can wear shorts again and not be concerned about my white legs. It just takes a few minutes to apply; you&#x27;ll be able to see a tan right away. I put it on every other day. Love this stuff. Buy this. You&#x27;ll won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and beautiful color with my fair skin. Only complaint I have is that most washes off after one shower and all off within 2-3 showers. Not a good idea to wear to the pool!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells Good (Almond, Beach Scent)&lt;br /&gt;- It Is VERY Effective&lt;br /&gt;- It Dries Fast&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t Stain&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t Look Orange ( Looked More Like A Golden Tan But Not Orange )&lt;br /&gt;- Good Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A Bit Too Effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I Give It 5 Stars :&lt;br /&gt;As You Can See , The Product Has More Pros Than Cons , In My Opinion . I Actually Looked Too Dark Because I Probably Applied Too Many Layers . Later On , I Will Use It Again With Less Layers To Achieve The Look I Want . You Must Try It Once Or Twice Before A Specific Day You Want To Use It For . You Have To Find Out How Much You Need To Apply For Yourself To Get The Tan You Want . Everyone&#x27;s Skin Is Different . That Isn&#x27;t Really A Big Deal Because That Is What You Should Always Do . In Conclusion , I Really Recommend This Product .</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks natural</li>
            <li> This is the best fake tan I think I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. I usually use St Tropez&#x27;s spray or mousse but saw this and thought for the price, why not try it. Boy I&#x27;m glad I did because it is so easy to apply, dries quicker than St Tropez and is way cheaper! The colour is an amazing chocolate brown (no range) and it&#x27;s immediate! The mitt that&#x27;s included seems to glide the spray lotion into your skin with ease and you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied. I am a light olive skin colour and I applied 3 coats, one after another and just loved that my body looked like I just came back from a tropical vacation. Highly recommend, and the scent is lovely and inoffensive. I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping over night with it on as it recommends, I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning and showered before bed as I don&#x27;t want my sheets to get dirty. Some brown colour can be seen in the water that rinses off in the shower but you are still left with a great colour. Be careful not to accidentally splash yourself where you applied the spray though. I did and it streaked but I just wiped it off with a damp tissue then reapplied a coat and it was fine.</li>
            <li> The color, the smell, the ease of application... there is nothing about this that is not excellent.  It works better than others costing two and three times more (yes, even St. Tropez, Bare Minerals and Tarte).  What really sealed the deal for me with this product is the way it fades.  Many others leave me patchy or scaly, but this just gradually fades like a real tan.  You cannot go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> If you love being fake than this is for you! Finally, a way to show people that you are as fake on the outside as you are on the inside! Blends smooth, better than other Fakies. They give you a cool little glove too, I&#x27;m assuming to slap people with so you can smear fake all over their face too! I gave it 5 stars so you can&#x27;t hate me too much right?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner, doesn&#x27;t steak, splotch, turn orange. So easy to apply on yourself and others. I love fake bake and it won&#x27;t be the last time I order!</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, Jergen&#x27;s and Loreal Sublime. I used to love Sublime, but Fake Bake color is beautiful and rich even after one application. I love the price and it includes a mitt and rubber gloves. Personally, I don&#x27;t think I need to apply it 5 days in a row, as I tan rather quickly, so every other day will be fine until I reach the desired shade. Although the smell is not offensive, the itching afterwards is. I used it and 2 days later, I noticed I was really itchy, could not figure out what caused it. I used Fake Bake again last night and within 3 hours, I was itchy and my skin felt flushed on the areas I applied to. I showered again, the itching subsided, but not the uncomfortable flush feeling. It&#x27;s too bad, I love the color and I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself allergic or sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li> i have tried many self tanning products and normally discontinue use due to the odor. fake bake does not have the bad smell others do. i use it at night which works well. you do need to be careful w/elbows &amp; knuckles, be sure to bend so that you get the product in the creases. if you get too much to can wash it off &amp; start over.</li>
            <li> All those embarrassing moments I had to brave a pool party unprepared like a chump... are history!  This stuff is great.  Easy to use and looks awesome.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use. Not Orange. I am 52 with fair skin. Looks natural. Best of all, it does not stink. You exfoliate, spray on the mitt, rub, done! I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER written a review but had to with this product. It already has amazing reviews and after my first use I see why. So many people complimented my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; and when I told them it was a self tanner they couldn&#x27;t believe it... I have already bought another bottle. I even used this on my face and it looked great!! It doesn&#x27;t stink and it doesn&#x27;t streak!!! So easy to apply...bye bye expensive spray tans!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no drying time necessary. The best fake tan ever ! I will use this from now on !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying products for years. This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes. Easy to apply. There is another review posted that gives a lot of details on how to use it. Follow her suggestions.</li>
            <li> Read another positive review with suggestions to counter others complaints.  Dead on fix! Easy, great color, quick dry! LOVE it</li>
            <li> excellent  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;excellent  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPED FAST JUST LIKE THEY PROMISED, LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE PICTURE AS PROMISED VERY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> I really like Fake Bake. Good even coverage quickly. No bad smell. Only drawback is that it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used self tanner in about 15 years or more.... I was so scared but I was so pale I nearly glowed in the dark.... I am on medication that makes me super sensitive to the sun so I have just gotten more and more pale. ANYWAY.... I was scared. I followed the instructions mostly. I used a sea sponge loofah and some sugar scrub I made to exfoliate everywhere, really focusing on my knees, elbows, ankles, hands and feet. Once out of the shower I toweled off thoroughly and put moisturizer on my face, hands, lightly on my knees, elbows, and feet. I put on the cute purple gloves sprayed the product onto the glove and started buffing the product on. It has a guide color so that you can see what your doing and help with even application. Already I was looking good. My husband even helped with my back to make sure I got everything even and non streaky. I was pretty much dry by the time I was done but I waited a extra 15 minutes plucking my eyebrows and cutting my nails etc before I got dressed. I woke up this morning sunkissed and golden and not even remotely orange. It looks like my typical tan. One application was enough to look like I&#x27;d spent days in the sun but again no orange tones or streaks, and I started PALE PALE. I would HIGHLY recommend this product and I will be buying more!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of self tanner.  This product covers well and is easy to apply with the mitt.  You can see the color when applying so you know if you missed a spot!!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so easy to apply before bed and wake up tan. I would def recommend it:)</li>
            <li> I was using st. Moriz tanning mousse before I tried this product. At first I thought this was better but I don&#x27;t think so anymore. First, this gives you a more subtle color but I tend to like a more dramatic bronze. Sometimes after applying it at night and washing off in the morning I feel as though I&#x27;ve washed off all the color! Second, it does not last long, it may give you a nice glow but after 2-3 showers its pretty much completely gone. Third, I have to put on so much because the spray does not spread easily. I do like the mitt it comes with. I just use it with my other fake tan. So I say if you want a nice glow for a special occasion, go for it. If you&#x27;re looking for all year round bronze, you may wanna try elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve found. I am very pale and this is really the only thing that has worked for me. With that being said, it is not perfect (I doubt if a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; self tanner exists) which is why I gave it 4 stars. Exfoliate first, use lotion on drier areas such as knees and elbows, spray the mitt a few times, and spread as evenly as you can. I even use on my face without any issues but I recommend doing your face first before too much product soaks into the mitt. The mitt doesn&#x27;t stay on my hand very well but I believe some reviewers use a rubber band to help keep it in place. It dries pretty quick and I have not had any issues with it rubbing off on my sheets, clothes, etc. It can be a little messy (I would also recommend cutting the spray tube a little and washing the mitt after every use) but the major drawback of this prodcut for me is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. I have to apply every other day (sometimes every day) to get some color and the darker I go the more orange/streaky it gets. But, it is an affordable product that lasts me quite a few weeks and actually gives me some color so I would highly recommend giving it a try even if you&#x27;ve tried everything else.</li>
            <li> I can put it on my face and arms well, and it looks really pretty good. But i just can&#x27;t seem to get it to go on my legs or belly as nice. I don&#x27;t like the mitt that you are supposed to use with it.  It get&#x27;s little knot like little balls on it. And the mitt makes it hard to apply evenly to your face, but i manage. I am not sure if i will buy it again. I might try another brand next time. Maybe if they had a different kind of mitt to apply it with...say with fingers and different material...it might work better.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST self tanner I have used! As a fair skinned person who burns easily, I have turned to slathering on the SPF and using self tanners for color. There are currently 6 different brands of self tanners in my cabinet and I have tossed countless others, in the quest to find (1) non-orange color, and (2) tolerable smell. While buffing on this tanner, I get an instant shade of tan, with a sun-kissed blush color on top. Better yet, it smells like pina colada during application, then once it dries it has almost no smell at all. The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; to this tanner is that the blush color comes off when it gets wet. It&#x27;s ok if that happens in the shower...but don&#x27;t get caught in a the rain! Once the blush color rinses off, the tan underneath lasts about 5 days as long as I do not exfoliate between applications. Other reviewers mentioned the mitt falling apart...my bottle is about half gone and the mitt is still going strong. I rinse it thoroughly and allow it to air dry before putting it away, and it still looks new. I like this tanner so much, its time to clear out the cabinet and get rid of my collection of self tanner fails!</li>
            <li> If you can follow the directions, this is an amazing product!!!!  You can SEE the tan on your skin as you rub it in!  It will get on your clothing (which is washes out), but I don&#x27;t advise putting on this product and then wearing white.</li>
            <li> The mitt and gloves provided really help in preventing the streaking and hand-staining that most other sunless tanners cause. Found my new favorite sunless tanner!</li>
            <li> I am white as can be and I burn as soon as I walk out into the sun!  I just do not tan.  At all.  I go from white to red, to a faded version of a tan and back to white.  Other sunless tanning lotions I used would leave streaks, give an orange appearance or just not work that great.  Before I found Fake Bake I would just spend the money to get an air brush tan for special events, etc.  This was actually recommened to me by my Esthetician who does my facials and air brush tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so exited to try this product when it came in the mail.  I read the directions, but they didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; completely into my head because I was so anxious to try it--I ended up spraying the product directly onto my skin and THEN using the mit to rub it in!!!!  It actually didn&#x27;t turn out too bad, as I only did small sections at a time.  I do now use it by spraying the solution directly onto the mit THEN rubbing it in to my skin and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome.  It has saved me so much money (from getting air brush tans) and I can apply it anytime in the privacy of my own home.  It doesn&#x27;t streak and I love that it has the applicator mit.  I really think that makes all the difference.  I do recommend washing the mit everytime you use it to keep it clean and lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!**</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a die hard St. Tropez person for a long while. I decided to try Fake Bake really because it was much less expensive than the St. Tropez. And to be honest I&#x27;m really glad I tried this out. The color is awesome and it lasts for a long while! With St. Tropez you felt sticky afterwards and the color maybe lasted 3 days. This goes on dry, you barely have any color come off on clothes, it smells great, and the color lasts at least a week (in my opinion). PLUS the mitt is really, really great. Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note the color guard can float through the air so expect it to land on surfaces in the bathroom. So when you clean your counters, floor, or anything else don&#x27;t be surprised if it comes up with a reddish brown color. :)</li>
            <li> I left this on for 16 hours and you can barely tell I used anything.  Then most of it washed off in the shower.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> WOW, This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this.  I love it and everywhere I go someone comments me on my tan.</li>
            <li> I am about the color of snow and this stuff has people asking me where I got my TAN!  Never thought I would EVER have that question.  Red and white have been my only skin colors up until now. No one could believe it was sprayed on.  I was so excited that I got several bottles for myself and others.  I LOVE this stuff. And just in case you are wondering, I was NOT paid to give a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s hard to put it on your feet without it looking blotchy.  But I think that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;common of most self tanners.  I also wish it didn&#x27;t start to fade after 4 or 5 days.  This is also a common complaint with self tanners.  So I guess until someone comes up with a monthly application I will have to just learn to deal with the frequent applications.  But overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well at first I was skeptical because the fragrance was a little strong at but I got used to it.  Also after you apply it be careful because it will streak or run if you splash water on yourself anywhere that you&#x27;ve applied it.  It does rinse off when you shower but that&#x27;s the color guard but some color does remain and you have to use this more than a couple of times to see any kind of results.  After two weeks I have seen results with this, it adds color and a bit of tan to me which I like because I haven&#x27;t the time to lay out and plus I don&#x27;t like getting freckles or sun spots and I don&#x27;t even tan evenly so this is pretty good.  BUT...it&#x27;s not dark enough and my husband says that he can&#x27;t even tell but then I had another friend tell me that I was getting really tan and they had thought that I had been out in the sun!  So I&#x27;m still giving this a good rating! Also I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of applying this stuff that I don&#x27;t even have to apply it in the shower anymore, I&#x27;m just careful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! I love it so much that I am selling my tanning bed since I&#x27;m starting to get nervous about melanoma cancer. I have been waiting to find something that would give me the ok to sell it by knowing that I could get a great tan from a bottle. This did the trick!</li>
            <li> Great product very easy to use. I have used a tanning bed for years and decided to try Fake and bake (my sister uses it). I will never use the tanning beds again. Goes on easy, looks like a great tan and no strong fragrance. Will continue using this product. Seller was great. Recieved product in 2 days as promised. Will buy from seller again. Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover evenly and there was a green hue to it... I followed instructions word for word. Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> The MIT makes this truly a flawless finish. No more streaks!  It&#x27;s the best self tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> not weird looking but really natural healthy glow to me rather than pale white like a trout&#x27;s belly IT WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> With a new baby at home, I don&#x27;t have much time to be in the sun. This self tanner is AMAZING and I have had lots of compliments, my friends can&#x27;t believe its a tan from a bottle. VERY NATURAL LOOKING! It takes a little bit to apply but worth it! I wish I would have found this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> There is a review (voted most Helpfil) which I won&#x27;t rehash. But I will add that, although I&#x27;m 21x2+3, that reviewer and I have the same skin tone and have tried the same tanners from drugstore and beauty counter. I&#x27;m here today ordering my second bottle of the Fake Bske because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried. I find this to be the most natural color for my pasty skin, and also the most affordable. I get the best results by exfoliating always and using the handy little mitt that comes with. I took the other reviewers&#x27;advice and trimmed the little tube in the squirt bottle straight out of the box. No leakage. I&#x27;ll probably order the bottle without the mitt this time because the one I got first is holding up. I rinse it after every use.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite self tanner!  No streaks.  I will be purchasing more.  Love the mit it comes with.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural!!  Make sure you do not have dry skin before application otherwise the &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34;  will turn darker.</li>
            <li> For someone who has spent Lots of $ and Lots of time in tanning beds I love this product! I have tried EVERY single self tanner that you can purchase in a drugstore and have NEVER found one I like, so that is why I continued to use the tanning beds. I am now over 30 years old and realize I need to stop using them so I went searching online for recommended self tanners and found this one. Once again I was apprehensive of using it because I have never found anything I like and I find it extremely important that it looks &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;. I have to say I am very new to this product, but I really do love it! The color does fade quite a bit when you wash it but not enough to &amp;#34;complain&amp;#34; about that. It really does leave your skin beautifully natural and bronzed. I feel like i&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;kissed by the sun&amp;#34; after using this. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be that I did not like the way it went on my hands, however I am new to using this and I am sure it is just that I have not mastered applying it to my hands yet. The spray dried in seconds and leaves a very pleasant smell (considering some of the other ones out there). The color is very nice and had my teenage daughter wanting to use it! I honestly would recomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love it. I use this anytime I&#x27;m gonna be in the sun so that I&#x27;ll actually wear sun screen and not feel like I&#x27;m missing out on getting color. No skin cancer fo me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never splotches, never streaks, comes off pretty evenly after about a week and a half. Smells great! I will never use another tanning product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Easy to apply, creates a super natural looking tan that lasts days, smells great, not sticky or tacky, awesome price. I LOVE IT and will continue to repurchase  it!</li>
            <li> Came perfectly on time.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on after I showered and everything.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT. Not orangy and im irish pale. Perfect color. Not sticky at all. Really happy with this. Easy easy easy application. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on easily. I can even use it on my face without worries. The color guard is fantastic.  Only bad part is, it starts to fad after a couple days. I have used the bottle probably 6 times and there is still more than half left!</li>
            <li> Natural, no way to overdo with color! I love it and will use just this product. No more tanning salons!</li>
            <li> I saw a review about this on youtube and she had nothing but great things to say about it, and she is one of my favorite gurus so I was like, I Need to order this! The thing she kept saying was &amp;#34;This does not turn your skin orange, you look like you just came back from the beach, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell!&amp;#34; I recieved it in the mail along with the body exfoliant, and that night I was in the bathroom with a big smile on my face getting ready to get my tan on. I am as pasty as it gets, I am always getting comments on how pasty I am and how I&#x27;d look so much better with a little tan or bronzer. I put it on and I noticed the smell was alright, not my cup of tea, not really into those hawaian tropical scents, but she said there was not that &amp;#34;fake tan smell&amp;#34; so I did not care. It came with the little mit, which you are supposed to spray the tanner on the mit and then start in a circular motion on your body until it is all blended well, it comes with a color guard so you can see where you are putting the tan and to prevent streaks (which didn&#x27;t even work for me.) I applied it all over my body and was super tender from trying to rub streaks away. I got dressed and went to bed, all excited to wake up looking like J.Lo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t wake up in the morning, but rather at about 3 in the morning when I smelt a faint &amp;#34;gym sock&amp;#34; smell. I was like. WTF is that? I start smelling around in my bed, around the floor and then finally I put my arm up and smelt my arm. BLEH!! That dreaded fake tan smell, front and center, even worse than the jergens brand!! I thought, Okay keep an open mind, you still haven&#x27;t showered yet maybe the smell will go away. I breathe through my mouth and go back to sleep. In the morning I go to the bathroom to take my shower, and I look at myself in the mirror and I am ORANGE.. O-R-A-N-G-E.. EXCLAMATION MARK. I just stood there in horror for about 2 minutes, and then my optimism kicks in.. Maybe it&#x27;s just the color guard! I get undressed and I see streaks EVERYWHERE (Yes I waited at least 20 minutes before dressing back up after I tanned), the worst was on my legs.. again.. gotta be the color guard, the streaks will go away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hop in the shower and have my normal shower, and that gym sock smell was just BAD so I lather up my body really good twice with my soap.. After the shower, I was still doing my silent prayer, &amp;#34;Please let the orange be gone, I have a picture day today.&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m a teacher) I breathe three times and then turn towards the mirror. Nope.. My Gods ahve foresaken me. I am orange.. and I still smell like a gym sock. I exercise every day which only makes the smell come out more. I will not be using or repurchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Natural color, may not be long term probley something you apply everyday but its the right color base high lights muscles and cheek bones. It washes off but I dont mind that since then it looks fresh. I went and got a versa spary tan and omg I wished it washed off cause the peeling process was diseased look</li>
            <li> I used this product for the color guide. It was a fast and easy fix for quick color when I needed it and it goes on smoothly. Other than that, the color does not last as long as I would like. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the color and it is very realistic, but I would much rather it last longer than my next shower. If you have light skin and you want a glow, this is the product for you. If you prefer a darker color or you have darker skin I would suggest  skipping this and using the Flawless Darker version of Fake Bake. The tanning mitt is excellent and should be a necessity for sunless tanning. All in all, this product is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews for products but this stuff is FANTASTIC! I have used so many sunless tanners and usually give up on them after 2 or 3 uses. Normally they&#x27;re streaky and orange. This stuff rocks! No orange tinge just a nice tan that you can build up to as dark as you want. Dries fast, not sticky at all. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> After all the years of using self tanners, finely one that actually looks natural. Amazingly easy to use, without any streaking! Awesome awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I used to airbrush but the place near me moved and I have been searching for another way to tan. I&#x27;ve tried self tanners before and they all smell horrible and come out splotchy. This works great, easy to put on and looks so natural, has such a mild smell, doesnt bother me at all. You need to exfoliate before otherwise tan doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. All in all very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner I use after trying so many. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who have tried every store brand self tanner and have been disappointed by every single one of them. Everyone knows that they turn you a weird orange color, when it peels you look dirty and half crazed. I was VERY skeptical of trying this one but after I read the reviews on how natural the tan looks I decided to order it. I followed the directions and it turned out GREAT. I had a natural brown tan, and when it began to fade it did so evenly without looking patchy. IF BROWN IS YOUR THING AND NOT ORANGE GET THIS!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Once you get good at applying it, no one can tell it is not a sun tan.  And it last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!  The spray is super easy but a little messy!  I just sprayed directly on my skin and blended with the glove.  Make sure you are careful with your hands and dry spots!  Also make sure it&#x27;s dry before getting in bed I have white sheets an noticed that a little bit of the guide came off but it rinsed right out!</li>
            <li> With a little practice and patience this product is a great alternative to tanning salons which can be inconvenient and spray tan can of course get expensive.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it for the first time when you have somewhere you need to be as it takes a little while to figure out the technique and work out the kinks. Somebody else recommended thoroughly washing the mitt after each application.  I&#x27;ve found this to be helpful as well.</li>
            <li> does exaclty what it says, turns you a beatuiful golden brown, smells great and dries so quickly.  I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping at a great price! Almost $10 less than you would pay at Ulta. The color developed into a very natural bronze shade and dried faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. The mitt that comes with it is also very high quality.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t look blotchy or streaky at all! And it&#x27;s a nice golden brown color. I love it! Go buy some! (:</li>
            <li> I have just used this product for the first time, and I am very impressed! It goes on very evenly, it smells nice, and it doesn&#x27;t look orange. It is a nice golden color!</li>
            <li> Great price and a very good product.  Really works, and a bottle last for a month or 2 of tans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanners since 2000. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t get on your hands because comes with gloves and mit&lt;br /&gt;2. Dries instantly, you can get dressed right after&lt;br /&gt;3. Almost no smell!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;4. Color comes on instantly to guide your application&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get real dark you need to apply a few days in a row, but for someone like me who is real pale one or two applications puts me in a happy place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I don&#x27;t shower the morning after I apply and wear it through the day to give me that extra tan look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still kind of getting used to it. I use it primarily on my pale face and sometimes I feel that it&#x27;s just a bit too dark and doesn&#x27;t look natural. By day 2, however, it&#x27;s faded and looks better. I can only get about 2, maybe 3, days out of it before needing to apply it again. It&#x27;d be nice if it lasted longer. It&#x27;s easy to apply and goes on really well. The pad used to apply the lotion is getting a little beat up, though, so I bought a new one at a local store for $2.00. I think the pad should hold up longer. And I do wash it after every use, as another reviewer suggested. I would purchase this again. I may try their face tanning lotion, too. The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange, like other products do.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use it on my body and face.  It&#x27;s pretty even color, I&#x27;m sill getting used to how quickly it dries so I still get some uneven color.  It smells very nice and isn&#x27;t sticky.  The color on my face fades much more quickly than it does on my body though.</li>
            <li> So all the reviews ive seen are from a womans point of view, i just wanted to give a guys take on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty pale skin and during the winter i can get pretty pasty, i bought this stuff and i put in on about once a week or so and it works great. The tan looks really good, and natural. It applies even and i have no problems with it at all. Sometimes i even just put a little on my face and neck to liven up my color and bit and it works good. Doesn&#x27;t look to fake or feminine at all. Can still be a man - with a tan..., much better than a tanning booth in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator pad for me sorta went bad after the first couple uses, the soft surface isn&#x27;t soft anymore, that&#x27;s my only complaint really but it still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great, works awesome for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner out there! I am IN LOVE. It doesn&#x27;t smell. It goes on bronze, so you can SEE where you&#x27;re putting it ... and it&#x27;s a GREAT value! I&#x27;m a bit of a sunless tanning-a-holic, and this is the BEST there is!</li>
            <li> It is an amazing self tanner. It smells tropical and goes on streak free. It gives a great long lasting dark color.</li>
            <li> I have been using self-tanning products for 8+ years. This is by far the BEST self-tanning product out there. The mitt helps you to get a nice even coat and this is the ONLY product that does not smell. My only piece of advice is that the product can stain your carpets in the bathroom. So, I apply this in the shower and then rinse the shower after the application so that the stuff doesn&#x27;t get on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Yes. That&#x27;s right.  The holy grail of sunless tanning products. It looks like a REAL TAN.  NO ORANGEY ANYTHING.  Take it from a Mexican girl.  I tan up real nice... but I live in Alaska right now, so my paleness was becoming alarming.  I&#x27;ve been developing a farmer tan up here (since it&#x27;s never warm enough to wear a bathing suit).  I used this product all over and stopped at my farmer tan on my arms.  My actual farmer tan matches with the rest of me.  Total farmer tan disguise.  You can&#x27;t see where my farmer tan begins and the fake tan ends.  THIS IS AMAZING.  I does last a pretty long time, too.  A week and a half or two weeks?  When you put it on, there&#x27;s a darker color guide that keeps you from missing spots (it washes out when you shower the next day, but the tan remains).  I do lotion up my knees, elbows and feet before I apply.  That&#x27;s a bit of trial and error.  The first time I went too heavy on the knees, the second time, too light.  I&#x27;m figuring it out!  I&#x27;ve used it three times and I&#x27;m not even halfway through the bottle.  At $17 a bottle it&#x27;s DEF cheaper than tanning beds. I look all vacation-ed out.  You&#x27;d never know I live in the Alaskan wilderness.  YAAAY!</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about using a self tanner, but application is easy, clean, and completely even. The perfect natural color.</li>
            <li> This product is the best of both worlds!! I was paying $40 a session to have someone spray me at an expensive and inconveient spray tan place. A co-worker mentioned this product and I really was sold on the other reviews. This product has the conveience of doing it yourself at home but with the coverage of a professional spray application. No, wait, it&#x27;s better than that! I can put on as much or as little (please read some of the older posts on this product, their directions are helpful) as I want and instead of the streaky-ness and uneven coverage of a sray tan done by someone. This product is  way more affordable, if you have doubts just try it, $20 is a bargain and you get more than one application out of it. Fake Bake Flawless... you have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Great product! This gives a very natural color with no stains on hands/fingers and dries super fast! I highly recommend this tanning liquid!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best self tanner i have tried. it gives you the perfect glow without the look of a fake tan. it spreads quickly using the mitt and i will DEFINETLY be repurchasing! good for people with more pale skin</li>
            <li> 4out of five stars because: you NEED to apply with a mitt AND gloves( it&#x27;s a hassle,but a must w/this). Also it  clogs my pores like some other self tan products do. It&#x27;s a pretty good color, not orange at all but I&#x27;ve had better. It also fades uneven on me &amp;I hate that blotchy look. But if you take the time ( &amp; it is time consuming !) to apply this correctly, then shower off the excess &amp; re apply if u want it darker-it will give u a pretty decent color.for how long, well I guess  everyone&#x27;s skin is diff so it would depend on the individual .all in all I&#x27;m not sorry I purchase this &amp; will use the remainder of it, yet I don&#x27;t think I will order again.i didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the original FB &amp; figured this would be better which it is. But to me this wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;all that\\&quot; &amp; there are many other products I use &amp;have used that are similar or much better &amp; they&#x27;re at cheaper prices on here ( Amazon) , so why settle?!!?  This had many Good reviews so that&#x27;s why I took a chance &amp;bought it. Everyone&#x27;s skin &amp;chemistry is different so what might work &amp;look great on 1person, might look horrible on another. If you like \\&quot;Fake Bake &amp; it works &amp; looks good on YOU, then I recommend this product highly. If you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, I would recommend THIS over the original as its easier to apply &amp;better outcome.its worth a try if you have the $. It just didn&#x27;t \\&quot; WOW\\&quot; me &amp; I can&#x27;t see paying this price for an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; product. Happy Shopping!!  :)</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to apply than the one I used to buy. It dries fast and it smells very nice! I like to use it during the winter months, the day before my ballroom dances.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for a year now. Amazing color, doesn&#x27;t come off streaky. I don&#x27;t really like the smell but it is bearable. Everyone asks if I have been tanning, this product is the best I have had and I have tried at least 8 different products and they all turned out orange and streaky. This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Great smell usually. It smells awful the Color is vry nice and brown no orange its the best one ive tried so far its a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying that I have tried almost every self tanner on the market. That being said, this one ROCKS. Not only does it smell amazing, but it leaves you with the most beautiful fake tan you can get. Just make sure you read the application instructions and follow accordingly. Happy tanning! :)</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product stating how amazing it is. I do NOT agree. I usually use St Tropez, which is amazing! I should have known better then try another kind when the one I already use works perfectly. Fake Bake streaked was extremely uneven and looked so unnatural! Then I had also read that you could use on your face.. Yeah don&#x27;t do that! My face looked muddy dirty. Not happy at all. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Could be a little darker like the lotion and spray but by far the easiest to apply!</li>
            <li> I actually really love the color of this product and have been using it for about a week now. There is SOME light streaking as it does take time to apply evenly. The only major problem is I have to apply every other day or so or the color fades FAST! Other than that, I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky like the other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I use this when I am in a super rush and need to get some quick color. You just rub it on and voila! Immediate color! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about using this, as with most spray tan products, it kinda gives you a musty scent under your arms.</li>
            <li> I have never used any self-tanners before this one, so I don&#x27;t have any experience to compare this to, but I absolutely love this product! I was scared that I would look orange or unnaturally dark after using it, but that was not the case at all. I feel like I looked as tan as I did during the summer time. The only downfall of this, is that when I stopped using it, I started to notice my tan &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; off when I would exfoliate my skin in the shower. At first I thought it was some freaky skin problem, but it was just the self tanner. Other than that, this is great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it! The bronzer/color guide looks pretty orange after you put it on, but if you exfoliate in the shower and apply it at night, you will have a golden brown glow after you shower it off in the morning. Once you&#x27;ve showered, it looks really natural and not orange-y at all. It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied. It&#x27;s foolproof. Color stays through a couple showers. Best sunless tanner out there.</li>
            <li> Not much better or worse than drug store self-tanners for me.  It doesn&#x27;t look orangey which is nice but it didn&#x27;t provide a lot of color and the mitt was a pain.  I prefer Moroccan Mineral Self Tanner instead - which I bought this summer.  It&#x27;s a lotion but gave me much better color for less.  This does dry quickly, has a decent and subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t streak.  All good things but not quite what I&#x27;d hoped for the price.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever tried, and I have tried many different kinds. The &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; helps with even distribution and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanners. Results are immediate</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a girl on YouTube. It goes on very well and is nice for a quick fix. Smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Takes a few days to build up, when tint washes off a lot of the color is lost, be careful on knuckles color can build up, thanks for good transaction.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product. After just a few uses of the mitt, it was gross and smelled funny. The product did indeed leave a residue and came off on my sheets (as expected), so I found myself not wanting to use it since there was no convenient times where I wouldn&#x27;t be ruining any garments. The color it turned my skin was also not natural looking. I should have saved my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> The most realistic face tan money can buy! I&#x27;ve been buying this product for over 2 decades with excellent results. Spray it on the Mitt (included) and wipe on face.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this tanner! I have tried so many over the years, and this product blows them ALL out of the water. The smell is faint, yet tropical. The application is so easy and not streaky. They are not lying when they call it \\&quot;flawless\\&quot;!! I don&#x27;t see myself going without this tanner :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you get instant color and about half of it stays after a shower. After a few showers and without reapplying its gone. Don&#x27;t put this on if you are going to sweat, it WILL get on all your clothes, socks, etc. I think its worth the price and something ill be using all winter long :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! The color is beautiful,it looks natural and steak free! Only complaint I have is the color don&#x27;t last long...seems to fade fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Will definitely keep buying</li>
            <li> This product is great! It has a subtle scent and immediately gave me the tan, bronzed look I was trying to achieve! Great price and was very easy to apply! I would reccommend this product to anyone! The mitt was great and I didn&#x27;t even need the gloves that came with it in the box.</li>
            <li> Works very well on body but I recommend getting something else for your face or it will get spotty and attracts towards your pours making your face look weird.</li>
            <li> BEST sunless product I&#x27;ve found that gives you a flawless golden brown tan with no streaks....but the best part is you can apply in 5 minutes! LOVE the ease of this product!!! The foam mit ios genius. :)</li>
            <li> This tanner is amazing! I wasn&#x27;t orange, streaky, nor did I smell of Fritos after using it. It has a nice tropical smell and gives a nice brown color. I also use the Fake Bake Body Passion Fruit Body Polish beforehand, to give my skin a nice scrub. It dries so fast, so you can get dressed in minutes instead of standing around like a starfish for half an hour. I spray 3 sprays on the mitt (brown side) and just rub in circles wherever I want the color to develop. If you&#x27;re going over your knees/elbows, keep them bent. I&#x27;ve found it helps fully cover those areas.</li>
            <li> Flawless is right, fades evenly. Exfoliate first and put lotion on dry parts, duh. Always brown/tan, never orange.. Apply as little or as much with the mist and glove it couldn&#x27;t be easier or better. Can&#x27;t get better results than your own custom spray tan. Hate to say it but better than the SUN laboratories lotion I used to use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very pink, pale skin. This is the only tanner I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look orange. It also has a fairly good staying power. Also, it fades very nicely. No weird splotches. Very good! Just purchased my 2nd bottle! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Okay honest review here! I will say I had high hopes for this product, and I was let down, AT FIRST. On the day I was to receive product, I exfoliated, moisturized and was so excited to put it on after all the wonderful reviews. The first time I put it on, I was horrified to see that I was getting all these dark blotches all over my face. I looked \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; so, to my dismay, I washed, exfoliated it all off and moisturized again thinking I messed up. 2nd try, same thing. Then after some research this is what I found, and after I followed it it was a HUGE HUGE sigh of relief. I was like yayy I can actually use it now! As with any new product, you have to get used to it. Follow these steps EXACTLY, no matter what you may have read, and I promise it will turn out \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; (gave 4 stars because contrary to most comments, after a day or two, it does have a tinge of orange. NOTHING BAD THOUGH like most other self tanners. Looks natural.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1- cut 1 inch off the bottom of sprayer tube (helps with the leaking most people report. Stem is too long!&lt;br /&gt;step 2- make sure you are showered, exfoliated, BUT NOT MOISTURIZED. I REPEAT, NOT MOISTURIZED.&lt;br /&gt;step 3- Wait until before bed when you aren&#x27;t running around. Sweating will take product off.&lt;br /&gt;step 4- put on rubber glove, and tanning mit&lt;br /&gt;step 5- spray directly on arms, legs, body and rub in one section at a time. (DO NOT SPRAY ON FACE.)&lt;br /&gt;step 6- spray onto glove and lightly apply to face.&lt;br /&gt;step 7- go to sleep. DO NOT MOISTURIZE if skin looks blotchy/dirty Don&#x27;t worry!&lt;br /&gt;step 8- wake up, shower, the color guide to see where you applied product will wash off, (blotchiness will go away.)&lt;br /&gt;step 9- dry off lightly, moisturize entire body. Keep moisturized to keep tan up&lt;br /&gt;Repeat steps the same night if you want to go darker. I did because the first layer didn&#x27;t show that big of a difference, but I read you&#x27;re supposed to apply thin layers. If you follow this I promise it will come out better. I guess moisturizing before applying blocks the product from allowing to stain your skin, so that could be another reason why people complain of color washing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: don&#x27;t go overboard on face. It takes 6 hours to fully develop. A little goes a long way. I went overboard my first time and it looked not so good lol.</li>
            <li> I buy these in groups of 8-10 bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;My girls and I like this because the color is good, not so orangey and fake.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s dark, which we like because we&#x27;re so pale naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the guide color makes it look like you just got home from Cabo, and it dries super quick unlike the creams.&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that it will discolor your sheets and white clothes.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s the best self-tan value.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had gallon containers of it :)</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful and even tan! I love applying it. I love that it also gives a slight tan right after using it, so if you feel like you need a tan ASAP you&#x27;ll apply and have a slight one, then wake up with a gorgeous one. Layers very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale (think printer paper) which is normally a state I don&#x27;t mind, but I get bored sometimes and enjoy altering my appearance, and that&#x27;s where this stuff is, normally I&#x27;m clumsy with self tanner and end up a blotchy, uneven weird looking mess.  With this... I actually look like I have a real tan, like *gasp* I might actually have achieved the colour naturally (I could never achieve a tan naturally, I don&#x27;t tan I burn/freckle, and besides skin cancer runs in my family).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even shave my legs after applying without looking blotchy (I don&#x27;t know how they do that, it&#x27;s probably magic)</li>
            <li> I love everything about Fake Bake ! It smells amazing - like tropical coconuts. It gives a beautiful tan! Its super easy to put on , especially if you&#x27;ve never used self tanner before . And the mitt makes everything even better !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I followed the advice of another reviewer, Glynis, and she was spot on! Make sure you read her entire review, as she has some pretty good advice. I did did what she said, trimmed the straw on the spray bottle and I didn&#x27;t have any leaks like some others had stated. I also exfoliated with a loofa sponge and shaved as to not get the &amp;#34;fuzzies&amp;#34; on me from the mitt (all Glynis&#x27; advice!), and I rinsed my mitt when I was done. I used a combination of Skin-So-Soft and some body lotion on my knees, elbows, feet, and hands before applying the Fake Bake and I didn&#x27;t rub the mitt on myself too hard. Another user stated she would rub the Fake Bake on a large area such as her leg, and then use what was leftover from that to wipe on her face as to not risk using too much there. Really good advice ladies! I could tell a difference in my skin color right away. It was a mild change, but I didn&#x27;t want to do anything drastic in one day. I will apply more tomorrow. This product also didn&#x27;t leave streaks, I wasn&#x27;t orange, and it didn&#x27;t smell bad like other self-tanners. I would definitely recommend this product to others and I will buy it again (if it ever runs out-&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s so much of it left!). Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m glad that I Bought this tanner. My skin tone is beyond just &#x27;white&#x27; im florescent ...glow in the light white, if I may. When I try to tan normally all that happens is my freckles get darker and I get red but after a few days I turn right back to my normal white color. I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin as well and I&#x27;ve used this tanner and haven&#x27;t broke out at all which is a huge plus. The color this Tanner gives is beautiful and natural. It goes on smooth with little mess. When I wash it off in the morning, though, I use just water. I get in the shower and use my hand to wash instead of a cloth and I use semi cold water... Just like when you dye your hair it calls for cold water to rinse never hot .. I&#x27;ve only put two layers  and I&#x27;ve reached the color I wanted. Until it washes off I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be putting on another layer :) very happy</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed back in November with Stage 0 Melanoma due to extensive use of the tanning bed. I never considered myself a tanning bed &#x27;worshipper&#x27;, but did get in it at least once a week every spring and summer. After having the cancer removed, I swore off the tanning bed. However, I still wanted a tan because everyone looks and feel better tanned. I posted on facebook a request from my friends on advice of sunless tanners. I received many suggestions, but the one that kept coming up was Fake Bake. I decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. Everywhere I go now people are asking to see my tan. I highly recommend Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note...I also purchased Fake Bake Face Bake and use it for my face. It is a lotion/cream. When I first put it on my face, I knew I was going to have to go in hiding for a few days because it was so dark. However, the next day I looked like I had been out in the sun the day before and had an awesome tan. It does have more of a tanner smell to it, but I still highly recommend this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS...&lt;br /&gt;1. goes on easily and you can see where you miss&lt;br /&gt;2. looks great the next day&lt;br /&gt;3. does not stain clothing so you can put it on the morning and go about your business&lt;br /&gt;4. lasts 5-7 days with proper care&lt;br /&gt;5. dries very quickly...no more walking around naked waiting to dry&lt;br /&gt;6. DOES NOT SMELL !!!! (this is the best reason to buy it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that people are realizing how great of a product it is and therefore it&#x27;s sold out everywhere!!!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product after reading the reviews and looking at you tube \\&quot;how to apply\\&quot;. But I didn&#x27;t expect to be this satisfied! I was a needlessly concerned because I didn&#x27;t buy the exfoliater. I didn&#x27;t need it. I simply brushed my skin with a loofah and shaved my legs in the shower. Dried off completely and applied with included gloves and mitt, and went to bed with very little dry time. I woke up with a natural glow but wanted a little more so just applied more and dressed for work. Pleasant smell too! Highly recommend! I should add that I am a strawberry blonde with fair to medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, dries immediately, natural-looking tan. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years, and this is the best yet (by a mile).</li>
            <li> Smells like a hot island babe. Coconuty beach scent. I feel the mit is a waste and sucks up a lot of product. So sometimes I just use a rubber glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply/spray amd spread and looks very natural! I&#x27;m sticing with this fake bake spary!</li>
            <li> I am super pale (redhead). My mom recommended this product as an alternative to looking ghostly or burning in the Sun. I get a lot of compliments when I use this, and it looks really natural...even for me. The bronzer is really helpful during application, and washes right off.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. I am very pale and it gave me a nice brown tan not orange at all. And you can build your color. IT DRIES SO FAST :) the only bad thing was the Mitt tends to flake off a little bit when rubbing the product on.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product. NO ORANGE cast to this at al. It gives a natural, brown glow. You do have to be very careful and sparse applying around elbows, knees, hands, shin-bone (I have bony shins) and feet. I apply a little baby oil to these rougher areas after applying the bronzer to help smooth out. It does rub off on clothes some (even after showering), so do not wear white or a light color a few days after. The stains do wash out easily though. It seems to last on me about 3-4 days. Best product I&#x27;ve come across for tanning.</li>
            <li> My go to product for a quick &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34; The best</li>
            <li> I always had horrible experiences with self tanners, so I took a chance at this one reading all the positive reviews, I must say I agree with all of them. I don&#x27;t have streaks or dark patches like other products, this actually makes me look naturally tan, application was easy. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> NICE COLOR!  kinda has a weird smell though...&lt;br /&gt;smells good at first then a few hours later its not so great smelling...</li>
            <li> Natural color, easy to apply, dries quick and smells great. I spray directly on my skin and then rub it in, otherwise the mitt absorbs too much. Smells kind of coconut-like but I feel like you don&#x27;t get that obvious fake tan smell with this stuff. Definitely heed the warning not to get wet at all during the set time!</li>
            <li> Great product does the work! Not orange and dries fast. Although it takes too many coats for me to be satisfied with the color so my next time I will order the dark version from fake bake</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It goes on perfect with no streaks and no stinky smells. You really can not mess this up! I put it on at night and when i wake up I look 10 sades darker. Do not freak out when you see yourself in the morning as a lot of it will wash off in the shower and leave you only with an even looking color.  The glove that comes with it gets pretty dirty after a few times of using it, but no biggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that i wish they improved has how long it lasts and how dark it really gets you. I need to do 2 or 3 days straight of it to get the darkness I want, but then it only last for about 2 days after (with daily showering). I would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanner for the past 11 years. The Fake Bake Flawless is by far the best self tanner I have ever used. It dries so fast; it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have any on. It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes! Ihave also used the fake bake lotion, gel, and airbrush spray; but the flawless is my favorite. I have fair skin so tanning beds and natural sun have never done a whole lot for me; except burn. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested. The only thing I would becareful of is the bottle, leaks really bad, so just make sure it isn&#x27;t turned upside down anywhere. But all in all, great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanning products. This is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever used! The color is brown instead of orange. I also workout a LOT so I was worried it would streak...not the case! One of the times I applied it before bed, I woke up with a huge streak down my arm. When I showered and dried off it was gone and left a pretty tan (obviously it was just the color indicator that streaked). I think it would be nice if the mitt was more like an actual mitten or something so it was easier to keep on my tiny hand. Other than that...no complaints. I also got the deep color I wanted after 1 or 2 uses. Dries incredibly fast as well! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff. I think my favorite feature is that there&#x27;s bronzer in it, which means that you can see it as it goes on, so you know if it&#x27;s even. It gives you a nice, non-orange glow, and the mitt makes it so that you don&#x27;t have orange palms. Great alternative to skin cancer, for sure! I&#x27;ll probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using sunless tanner for years and this is the one product I always come back to. The applicator mitt allows for an even application every time, and the guide color helps me make sure I don&#x27;t miss any spots. It has a slight smell to it before you shower for the first time (like all sunless tanners) but this one is actually quite pleasant (especially compared to other products). I have moderately pale skin, I can tan in the summers but never get extremely dark, and this color comes out perfectly on me. I imagine you could apply more often or thicker to get a deeper color, but I usually stick with re-applying every 3-5 days and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have very pale legs, so needless to say they don&#x27;t see the sun too often. I&#x27;ve tried various other self tanning products (Jergens, L&#x27;oreal sublime glow...) This BY FAR has been my favorite. Super easy to use (especially with the provided glove), pleasant scent and dry time is instant. I apply this 3-4 times a week, in the evening. When you shower you do see some of the product rinse off, but my legs still have a nice &#x27;bake&#x27; on them. Also, product has not discolored my bedding or clothes. I will def purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I used to be obsessed with tanning until I ha a spot burned off my nose from it. Ever since then I have searched high and low for the perfect self tanner... And this is it!! Goes on so easy, smells great, dries fast, and fades natural... I will never use another product!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! So glad I looked at reviews before ordering. It is the best sunless tanner I have used!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews (first one was extremely helpful) I timidly gave it a try and was VERY happy with the results.  If you follow the suggestions in the first review it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and the shipping was very quick too.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come out orange and streaky like a lot of other self tanners!&lt;br /&gt;Considering I have to be tan year-round and melanoma runs in my family, this was the best decision I made to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants that flawless, fresh tan !</li>
            <li> This is only my second self-tanner I have used but color wise this is the best of the two I have used and this is more of a brown versus orange so the color is very nice... I think all self-tanners can be a pain to use but this one dries quick which I really like. The smell is okay not terrible but not necessarily good either.... I apply at night after bathing and exfoliating my skin really good and rub into my skin. You don&#x27;t have to be perfect when applying this one and I haven&#x27;t seen many streaks. I wear overnight and then bathe which some drops off in the shower and of course my white pillow case is stained from the overnight wear. I have dry eczema patches on my elbows and my lower legs so I apply lotion in those areas before I apply this. At first especially on your face after application you will be a little worried that it will streak or not look even but after the shower in the morning every time I have used it I have been pleasantly surprised that every time it has come out even on my skin. The only thing I dislike is that this doesn&#x27;t last long and I have to apply about every other day or every three days.</li>
            <li> First tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used nap but works very good and doesn&#x27;t look fake, even my hubby was skeptical but he also said it wasn&#x27;t orange or fake looking at all. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Its the best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after showering before bed, Do not apply too much stay on the lighter side. most of it washes out the next shower. remember to exfoliate before ( better 24hs before first use). No streaks , very even color , last about 6 times I used every 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> love it!  very natural</li>
            <li> I really like this product- it gives a believable tan and smells significantly better than other tanners I have used.  I took off stars for the spray bottle.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a defect on mine but it leaks.</li>
            <li> I like fake bake , I would LOVE fake bake if only it would last longer. Gives a beautiful natural looking tan. I&#x27;m fair skin and it looked great. Used on my face as well and I have sensitive skin. Only last about 2 days</li>
            <li> I seldom write product reviews but I have to say that this is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. To me the most important characteristics of a sunless tanner is smell, color, and ease of application. I hated the smell of them which is why I rarely used them. This one has NO bad smell, and it goes on easily with the applicator mitt. Also the color looks really good. I will absolutely buy this again. But it seems like it will last a long, long time so I don&#x27;t know when that will be. The price for this product is unbelievable as well, so I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very natural color.  Never found one that looks natural before Fake Bake. I order this every summer and have used it for years.  I always get comments about my nice tan.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is a great product., especially for us fair skinned folks.  It smells like coconut and applies very easily and uniformly.  No streaks and no lines.  It also is a good color, not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; that makes it look fake.  Friends have been surprised because it looks real.  If it would continue to look like it does before a shower I would like it even better.  But even though I applied it before bed so that it had a chance to thorougly dry most of it washed off, but enough color was added to make it worthwhile.  I recommend this to anyone that needs a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; for looking tanned and will definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;It does have to be applied at least every 3 days to maintain the color, but the small effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Instant results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have always tanned in a tanning bed until I had a spot removed off of my chest due to sun damage. I am blonde, light eyes, fair with freckles. My dermatologist warned me for years to stay out of the sun. Now at age 30 I am taking her advice. This product has been wonderful. I use it all summer long and people compliment my tan all the time. This is the first product I have ever used that did not turn me orange. No complaints but you do have to learn how to apply. Once you have done it a few times it is very easy! I always apply at night before bed onto clean skin. Lotion and antiperspirant will turn the product green on your skin. Shower the next morning and it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> Best tanner, gives you a great bronze look. I recommend this to anyone whos looking for a natural way to tan</li>
            <li> Worked great on my white legs, stayed on for about three days then naturally stared to fade.  Nice product for me who does not have time to spend hours tanning but wants to go outside with friends and not have that totally white glow.  I thought the spray looked natural and I liked the mitt that came with it to put product on so I did not get it on my hands.  The only thing I would suggest is putting a towel down while you use it as it will make a mess on the floor that is hard to clean up/much easier to wash a towel.  Great product that I would recommend to anyone looking get tan quick without having to go to the tanning beds.</li>
            <li> this tanner give you awesome color if you don&#x27;t want to be 2 dark and it doesn&#x27;t streak until you get down on the end of the bottle which is weird but anyways it&#x27;s a great tanner for those who don&#x27;t want want to go to the tanning bed or go spray tanning because it&#x27;s so bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Been using it for years</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected. It delivered a natural looking glow that I loved it and for once I didn&#x27;t stink like self tanner. It didn&#x27;t wash off like some people said. Naturally some color was lost in the shower the morning after but I still maintained a lovely glow. This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Just got this in today! Tried it out... Fell in love!! It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my skin sticky, and I can see instant results! I&#x27;m a huge fan!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews were right. This is the best fake tan I have ever used. Wished it lasted longer, but they all fade.</li>
            <li> Better than most but can still have a streaky look if not applies carefully.  Also has a more yellow look than I like.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about this product is that you can see the color instantly. With some of the other spray tans is takes 4-8 hours for color to develop. When applying this you can see exactly what it looks like and rinse off excess color if you have applied to much. The only bad thing about this product is that you must spray it on a glove and then rub it in. If it was available in a spray mist it would be easier to apply evenly. You must know what your doing and have good technique to properly apply.</li>
            <li> This had a beautiful brown color but it was not the easiest to apply. I had lots of streaks but I have very pale skin. If you are a newbie this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I previously used Tan Towels but always felt like the result was pretty orangey. This doesn&#x27;t have a hint of orange and it actually worried me because the liquid was so brown. I have fluorescent white skin but the color ended up looking great! I love how it comes with gloves and a mitt - makes it very easy to apply evenly and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hands being stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other benefit compared to something like Tan Towels is that this has bronzer, so you can see where you&#x27;ve missed and you can also check to make sure everything is coated evenly to avoid blotching or streaks. Downside to this is that it comes off all over your pillow and sheets.. not sure what to do about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I showered in the morning all of the bronzer washed off and left me with a great looking color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the comments saying it looked like dirt or that it washed away after the first shower can safely be ignored. The \\&quot;dirt look\\&quot; goes away once you shower and all the bronzer washes off. The tan itself remains. Make sure you exfoliate before first use, that may be why some people were having problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good self tanner, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and have a very hard time tanning instead of burning. All sunless tanning products have left me streaky and/or orange. This product was easy to apply, dried quickly, and left a gorgeous brown color rather than a nasty orange. I followed other reviews that said to trim the spray top straw, and there was no leaking whatsoever. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few self tanners and this is so far the best Ive used.  Its very easy to apply and is colored so you can see if you miss a spot.  Also, the color is a nice brown hue and not orange at all, very natural color.  Has a really nice smell and not a hint of normal tanner smell.  I will definitely be ordering this from now on!</li>
            <li> I have tried MULTIPLE self-tanners: lotions, sprays, etc. This has been the BEST. I love how quickly it dries and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; like the others often do. Also, the smell is very good. I had the Fake Bake lotion before and while I did like the color it gave me, it left my skin feeling a bit sticky and the smell wasn&#x27;t the best. If I wore it during the day or even at night, the smell kind of got to me. This product is super easy to apply. I took the advice from another user on here about cutting the tube before use and it&#x27;s not leaked at all for me so far. I like that I can \\&quot;blend\\&quot; the color with the mitt that comes with this product and that I can see the color immediately. I will definitely be buying this product again! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I like it because the smell is nice. However, it does not last as long as I thought, since it said to apply once a week. Also, like all of the others it looks like you have spots when it starts to wear off, which is sooner than some other brands. I will say the smell is most of what I like about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake Flawless self tanning product.  I have used other products of this nature and found this to be the best.  The tan is natural looking and the product is easy to apply.  I did have a problem with the bottle leaking when using the spray applicator. I tried cutting the tube that goes into the applicator, shorter, as it was to long, but this did not help.  I went to Walmart and bought a travel, 8 oz. spray bottle and poured the product into that.  It worked great. I later read an idea from another product user.  She didn&#x27;t remove the protective seal that is on the bottle..she just pierced a hole in the center and inserted the tube through the hole and hers worked fine doing it that way.  The kit comes with 2 protective latex gloves, to protect your hands from absorbing to much color, and it also includes an application mitt.  The only problem I had with the Mitt is that it is hard to keep on your hand.  If they would attach elastic around the bottom, it would stay on your wrist better, instead of slipping off.  I have seen other product mitts, however, and they are all made the same way.&lt;br /&gt; I love the product and have already ordered 2 more bottles.  The product does go a long way, but I do want to keep it on hand.  I have been unable to buy it in any store, so mail order seems to be the only option, which takes time.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of self-tanners because I am a pale redhead that burns easily. This goes on evenly, activates and dries fast, and has NO SMELL. My only complaint about this product is that it starts to fade after 24 hours and you have to reapply every day to every other day. I have also tried Sun Labs self-tanner which lasts longer and gets you darker quicker, however, the smell is so bad that I can only put it on before bed. I also find with Sun Labs self-tanner that even after showering in the morning, I can still smell the tanner on me throughout the day. Fake Bake however, is the only self-tanner I can wear during the day and apply whenever I want without fear of giving off that funky self-tanner odor. Also, this product being a spray (as opposed to a lotion) will last you through the summer without repurchasing. Lotions get used up much more quickly AND are more expensive! My advice for this product is to get the mitt slightly damp before rubbing on skin. This will help the mitt from absorbing a lot of product (another downside to lotions) and it will go on more evenly. I am repurchasing today!</li>
            <li> love the tan it gives but if you  dont have anyone to help you get the back it is hard so for me an aerosol can  spray tan works better for me.  i do love how it gives you a tan right away and  gradually builds darker.</li>
            <li> My friend  came to work so tan like she went to a beach for a day I asked what she used and she said she applied fake bake 3 days in a row and after that once a week. This product if used properly does not even look like a fake tan it goes on smoothly and blends very very well to where I had people asking me where I went tanning at. Very impressed and love this product esp during the winter months</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes of this being a great product. I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands of self tanner for my legs because for some reason the rest of my body gets a beautiful tan, but my legs don&#x27;t :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I liked the color of this product and the application was fairly simple. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad. My issue is that it sinks into each and every hair follicle (on freshly shaved and exfoliated legs.) This look is not cute. I had polka dotted legs. I also noticed that it made my stretch marks dark and waaaaay more noticeable. For those two reasons, I will not be using this product again. I&#x27;ll stick to my Lancome flash bronzer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  It looks very natural and I am a very fair complected person.  Doesn&#x27;t streak or spot.  It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t rub off. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better self-tanners I&#x27;ve used, but even so, I still ended up with those dark spots &amp; streaks of uneven tanning. I followed the directions to a tee. I even watched several demonstrations on YouTube, so I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. Hopefully, your luck will be better than mine. On a more positive note, I do like the color.  It&#x27;s more brown than orange, so it looks more like a suntan than a self-tan. Now, to the one big negative I have to mention...that darn mitt they include to apply the tanner with. It&#x27;s too big; it&#x27;s awkward to use, and it is constantly sliding off my hand. I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in place by putting a rubber band around my wrist, but that really doesn&#x27;t work all that well, and it&#x27;s an inconvenience when it&#x27;s time to switch everything over to using the other hand. A possible suggestion...why not design the mitt so that it fits snugly around the wrist like a regular glove? It certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt. Also, just so you always have everything at hand , make sure you have extra latex gloves. The ones they include are flimsy and tear easily.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, when I opened the package I was really nervous if the bottle would have been open and used. The box came COMPLETELY torn up and everything was just stuffed in the box. The bottle was NOT open..will update later tonight after I use.</li>
            <li> Best part of using fake bake is that it&#x27;s the perfect color for pale people and you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying the tanning lotion. Lasts a few days and with this price I can have tons of tans instead of paying 25$ for a spray tan that lasts 3 days. Dries quickly on your skin but still has a tanning lotion smell but its not terrible. Came with the tanning Mit which is perfect to use for application.</li>
            <li> Well this is best self tanner so far that I&#x27;ve tried.  I did try using the mitt that comes with it, but I think I get a quicker coverage (because this stuff dries fast) using the rubber gloves that comes with it. I just spritz it on an area and rub in quickly with gloves on. Pretty good.  Not bad for the price too.  I will probably be back for this item again.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked at tanning salons, and been an avid tanner for the last 5-6 years. Once I heard about the negative affects that a tanning bed can have on your skin, I switched to self tanners, which were all CRAP until I cam across FakeBake. It&#x27;s is flawless, leaves no streaks, smells great, and gives you a kick ass color. I HIGHLY recommend Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I love this tanner! It&#x27;s awesome and gets you really tan really fast. It&#x27;s great. Only one thing I made a mistake on... I applied the tanner to my whole body, boobs and all, I&#x27;m also a breast feeding mother who co sleeps with my baby. I applied it in the afternoon and then went to sleep at night and when I woke up I saw that my baby had tan marks all over her face from my tanner. Lets just say it took a long time for it to go away... After scrubbing. Sooo wasn&#x27;t too happy with that but since my body isn&#x27;t that bikini ready anyway, I&#x27;ve been just applying it to my legs and arms and tummy, steering clear of the boobs. Also, what kinda sucks is after your done and naked, if you accidentally splash water on you.. It sucks. You wash the tan off and it&#x27;s almost impossible to blend it all perfectly again. Not fun. Also, make sure you shower the morning after you put this stuff on. If you don&#x27;t its like you have a too coat that rubs off easily, including on your clothes. You&#x27;ll lose a little bit of the tan but trust me.. It&#x27;s worth not leaving tan everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and grew up in the Texas sun. I have since moved to Washington state and must say I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.  I have had moles removed in the past pre-cancerous and really am not at an age (46) to be basking in the sun all the time, since it will also cause wrinkles!  I love a healthy glow in the summer, especially on my legs when I wear dresses and shorts.  This gives a progressively gradual color and makes me feel good about myself.  No streaking and no orangeness.  Sometimes can be a little blotchy, but nothing minor touch-ups can&#x27;t resolve.  This is my go-to tanner.  I begin using it in the spring and get a salon-applied spray-tan before I go home every summer.  This tanner increases the longevity of the salon tan!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews (the Baiden mitten too) and I am happy to say I will never again pay for an expensive spray tan at the salon.  I like that this one is very subtle and easy to use.  No orangey tint and no splotches.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEE this. Iv&#x27;e been using it for a couple years now and it creates the perfect glow. It&#x27;s not orange or muddy. it&#x27;s also very buildable (I use two coats every time to get a noticeable tan). The glove that comes with it works very well too. You just have to make sure to wash the glove after tanning otherwise it wont be as soft overtime and might crack. Lasts about 5-6 days. Perfect temporary tan.</li>
            <li> Very natural color. It works best if you apply as directed. Apply in the evening and shower off in the morning for best results. Get the dry oil and exfoliater, too. It makes it so much easier. Great product!</li>
            <li> I tried EVERY single self-tanner out there. I don&#x27;t believe in using tanning booths, but I&#x27;m as white as a ghost and always wanted to be tan. Long story short, this stuff is amazing! The color looks great, and while it may stain clothes the first day, it comes right out when you wash it. It gives a nice dark glow that actually looks real, and appears right away. You can see where you apply it too and the mitt is especially handy when doing your back. It also prevents streaking. The only downfall is the fact that it tends to wash off a little too fast, but then again, there&#x27;s still a lot of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; left after the first wash. Also, when you get to the bottom of the bottle, the tanning product doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. All in all, this product is a definite must if you want a nice tan for this summer while saving your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-C.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, the glove , fast shipping....everything but that spray bottle top! Such a mess! It gets product everywhere in my bathroom :( maybe a foam next time fake bake pleasssse?!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Natural looking. No complaints. This will be my go to fake tanning product!</li>
            <li> As a consumer of MANY self tanning products, I can HIGHLY recommend this product. I even own a Luminess Spray tan machine, and this to me, is even better. I used the product last night for the first time and it was effortless and the results are truly flawless. Blends into the skin well and looks really natural. It was a very simple process. Well worth the money and I will reorder. :)</li>
            <li> Best color but the mitt and it&#x27;s annoying fuzzies are aggravating. Still the best fake tan out there. THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t think it works well. It gets on things. It doesn&#x27;t make me that tan. It&#x27;s messy. The glove isn&#x27;t as nice as the one I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s hard to spray it only on the glove. Only positive is that when you apply it you instantly have a little more color than you did before. You do not wake up in the morning with amazing results. Tanceuticals is my fav and I bought this to go a little cheaper (and I had an amazon prime addiction). I am back to tanceuticals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous self tanners before this one and I have to say this one surpassed all the others. The buffer method leaves absolutely no streaks (if you are careful, just take your time) and the tan really lasts. I had quite a few friends ask me if I had beens using a tanning bed after just two applications of the fake bake spray.&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: make sure to cut about an inch and a half off of the straw BEFORE inserting it into the tanner bottle. This will prevent any leakage. Take your time applying and be sure to buff the product in gently and completely. Wash the buffer pad after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no complaints and I know I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing works awesome! Few things first before using I had to cut the straw in the bottle it was too long and you need to exfoliate with a mitt first get the dry skin off and also apply lotion to elbows,ankles, knees, etc first because it gets darker on those spots  also shave before using! but overall the best tanning spray I love it! I have fair skin and it works great!</li>
            <li> Love that I can get a tan instantly with this product. Smells great and easy to apply for any mom on the go.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I feel like I finally found the best secret to staying tan all year round without damaging my skin. It has s slight red hue so it looks like you were freshly out tanning in the sun. It fades very evenly and even looks natural as the color fades (seems to lose a little bit of the red and just look like a nice brown/golden tan). After the first application, I have been applying about once a week and it seems to stay. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t come off on towels after showering and does not rub off on gym clothes when you sweat. I&#x27;m completely amazed by this product and will be repurchasing as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> Great color, very easy to apply evenly (wash the give after each use) but color doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Been trying to take care of my skin (less Tanning bed) and i live in Florida… Tried fake bake last night showered used a exfoliating scrubber . applied before bed  . I used it gently on my face,  hands, elbows , knees.. and just took my time took about 20 minutes to apply . it dries pretty quick .. Laid down on my white sheets , It did not rub off on my sheets woke up to a beautiful tan that looks real . Couple light smudges around my toe but i can deal with that. Im a fake bake tan  fan now!!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest self tanner that is, has been or ever will be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell, deep and rich brown (and I&#x27;m crazy fair), quick dry time AND it has enough color to be a great guide for where you&#x27;ve applied. I have tried too many others, all in vain.</li>
            <li> used twice a week and keeps a nice light tan color. Even my husband noticed!! (that is big deal) I washed the mitten after use, and it stays good.  I will buy again after this runs out. I have had it for a few months and it still has a lot in the bottle.</li>
            <li> For me, it took a lot of coats to really make a difference, but with that said...the color was great and didn&#x27;t streak much.  Smell was good too...I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love my self tanner. It smells really good and is not orange like other products I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good. (:</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tanner... and I&#x27;m really picky! I am a fair skinned redhead who dreams of being tan. I live in CA at the beach where it&#x27;s pretty much sunny all year long. I have tested SO MANY different tanners and thus is at the top of the list. It does take longer to apply than a basic lotion and you do have to wait a full 8 hours and then shower to get the full effect (I highly recommend shaving at night and then going to bed with the tanner and showering off in the a.m.) The tan is super natural, golden, and dark. It isn&#x27;t streaky and has NO SMELL! My husband is happy about that because he hates the smell of tanner usually. Be sure to put a towel in your bed if you decide to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; your tan at night or it will rub off on your sheets. Wear the gloves under the buffing mitt or you will have brown palms. If I keep my skin hydrated with lotion after I tan, it will last a solid 5 days. Also, it keeps up pretty darn good if you are in the water. Just try to pat dry instead of rubbing with your towel.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose my tan! This fake bake is the best solution! It takes just a few minutes and I look golden all the time. I apply it maybe twice a week just to my arms, chest and face, and I look perfectly tan. I won&#x27;t ever have to go back to fake baking again! I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly, doesn&#x27;t look orange. I am a pale person and it made me tan in three days.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Fast, easy application -- I apply with latex gloves not the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on evenly and doesn’t streak if you rub it in properly&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant smell – no harsh chemical smell&lt;br /&gt;- Dries fast&lt;br /&gt;- Good price – very affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Color has an orange tone – looks quite unnatural&lt;br /&gt;- Color fades FAST!! Even after applying liberally, within 2 days my skin is back to its original color.&lt;br /&gt;- Every time you shower you literally see the dye and your money going down the drain&lt;br /&gt;- Everything you touch will be red/orange! This stuff stains! My white toilet seat has red cheek marks because I sat on it the DAY AFTER using this tanner. If you wipe it immediately with rubbing alcohol it should just come right off though .</li>
            <li> LOVE this!! Works great makes a really ice glow!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and appears natural!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this tanner.  I have used many and this is the first and only one that does&#x27;t leave an orangey color.  Very easy to apply with the sprayer and the mitt.  You can not mess this up. Took me three applications to get the color I wanted on my legs that matched to the real tan I already had on my arms and chest.  Three days later and very little fading, even with shaving my legs.  I will definitely recommend this product and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a little hint if you do get a spot that is too dark, use a small amount of wintergreen alcohol on a cotton pad and apply and blend until you fix it.  I got that hint from a girl that worked at the tanning salon years ago.  Luckily with this product I don&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> This by far is the most amazing self tanner I have ever used. When you put it on you may feel like you &amp;#34;overdid&amp;#34; but just hop in bed and shower in the morning and you will have a perfect tan. I have white towels and white sheets. It you allow the tanner to dry for 5 minutes it will not smear on your fabrics. I have the applicator because it is mess free. Buy this !!!! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Goes on great with the glove provided for arms and legs.. Face is another matter. Has to be to be very evenly put on or it lays in places that you dont want it too. Other words it lays in the wrinkles on your face or marks that should not be there. Not happy with that situation.</li>
            <li> great for a last minute &#x27;tan&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, easy</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is wonderful!  It dries immediately, and is very natural looking, lasts several days before reapplying is necessary.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as other tanners.</li>
            <li> Followed directions for application, went on beautifully, washed off in the shower the next morning.  Noticed in product information and on the bottle that it has a 10 month shelf life, instructions indicated this could be extended by refrigeration.  Interesting, because I couldn&#x27;t locate a sell by or use by date anywhere on the bottle.  Unable to locate a production date either, so how do you know whether the product is within the 10 month shelf life?  Perhaps this is why it washed off the next morning.</li>
            <li> good buy!&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> This product is better than most, however it is not very dark once you wash the bronzer off, the bottle only lasts me about a month, and places like me knee-pits (back of knees) and elbow-pits (inside of elbow) fade much quicker than anywhere else. This fading has only happened to me with this self tanner. It&#x27;s fairly fixable though, just put more around the inside of your knees/elbows and then wet a paper towel or some TP and wipe off the tanner from any still tan parts (so it only covers white areas you&#x27;re trying to fill in). Overall, it&#x27;s still one of the best self tanners I&#x27;ve ever tried, especially for this price ($12.94 when I bought it). I&#x27;ll be ordering a refill bottle soon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I applied it as instructed and received a wonderful even color. I would highly recommend reapplication  over the course of a few days, to achieve the perfect color/tone. I will never again buy any other self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key reminders/tips:&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate before applying&lt;br /&gt;Shave before applying&lt;br /&gt;Apply lotion to your joints, where dryness usually occurs, to prevent color buildup&lt;br /&gt;Consider buying an additional mit (mine was done after the first application)</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning product that I have ever found. The color is the best,,,,,,, no yellow or orange color... used it on my white legs and after 2 applications they look lick I just got thru tanning with&#x3D;out the chance of cancer...........  GOOD PRODUCT FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> Goes on fantastically, but has too much of an orange tint!</li>
            <li> Only used it once, but it worked amazingly. The tan lasted about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> No additional comment</li>
            <li> I am really pale---and I love this product. It gives me a tan instantly. You must spread and be organized in your method of spreading on your skin--as with any tanner. Most of all I like the smell which has a hint of chocolate. If you have been self tanning the last 6-10 years you will remember smelling like you have been pickled. Nothing like the smell of vinegar;D.</li>
            <li> Gives a perfect tan color, very natural. Just be careful as it is hard to spray on yourself without overspray.  I add it to body lotion for the perfect application.</li>
            <li> UhhhhhhhhhhhhMAZING!  Buy it.  If you are looking for a great non streaking and natural looking spray tan just stop here, you found it.  I was super shocked at how easy this stuff was to put on.  I&#x27;ve always had fair skin and super pale legs so I don&#x27;t wear shorts.. so they get paler catch 22 ughh)  In the past if I&#x27;ve used spray cans, lotions and foams.  The best of times with those products even with the utmost careful application was always given away by ONE DAMN SPOT.  Be it the palms of my hands, a streak down the back of my leg.. I mean, how the heck am I supposed to know I rubbed something a tiny incy bit thicker in an area that only someone 10 feet behind me can see!?  Enter Fake Bake.  I read the reviews and the top review was super informative so I gave it a try.  Okay, usually self tanner is something I would use for special occasions or weekends I wanted to wear shorts.  Not any more, this stuff is so easy to put on with that awesome mitt that I&#x27;ll be doing it  pretty reg from now on.  Putting on Fake Bake was like this: START: 1. Take long hot shower and exfoliate your skin  2. Moisturize your knees, hands and elbows. (I should be doing this anyway right? :) 3. Put on the mitt and spray some FB on it, rub it on.  Rub it all over.  D. O. N. E.  I usually rub some olive oil or vaseline on my hands and wipe em just in case it gets on my palms but never had any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so easily.  You can see exactly where it is and it gives you time (not a ton... don&#x27;t stop and paint your nails) to get it even.  On the first try I was even able to get my whole back p e r f e c t l y. My boyfriend told me today, &amp;#34;you&#x27;re really getting a tan!&amp;#34;  Yeah, he knows what I look like naked folks.. he would know if this came from some old can but had NO idea till I told hime :)))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I&#x27;m glowing ;)</li>
            <li> excellent product for a quick flawless tan especially for your legs that don&#x27;t get color as quick when tanning.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend to anyone no matter what skin type because it blends so well, I am fair with freckles and when i got done using it i looked like i had just got back from a vacation from the tropics</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it to me.  It does a good job in the cover up the white skin patches caused by vitilago.  My normal skin tans ok, and I am a middle aged caucasion male, and this stuff is pretty amazing. I have tried many things in the past, and this makes my problem skin areas look more natural than most things I&#x27;ve tried. If you put to much on, don&#x27;t worry too much, you can get some of it off in the shower.  The application mitt and gloves are a nice idea to keep the palms of your hands from getting tan.  Especially thrilled to have my hands looking fairly normal instead of pale white. Have used on my chin to cover a spot too, but sparingly to blend in color, and still use the coloration liquid for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had many compliments and inquiries as too the amount of time i&#x27;m spending in the sun---none! best sunless tan solution i&#x27;ve tried so far.I would have given it a five but its a bit awkward to apply evenly w/o making some mess.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE, LOVE IT!!  Will order again without a doubt.  It&#x27;s lasts for days and it truly is flawless to put on</li>
            <li> I feel like I was really misled by all the positive reviews. I have tried this product many different times, and attempted to apply it in many different ways....no matter what I can&#x27;t get it to go on completely evenly. The color is great at first.....until anything splashes on you or you take a shower, and then it&#x27;s GONE. But you HAVE TO take a shower before going out because if anything should splash on you, even if you wash your hands, it leaves major splash marks and streaks. I love the color before you wash it off, but could hardly tell I applied anything after showering...and that&#x27;s after leaving it on overnight and applying it several times. The mitt wore off extremely quickly, but you have to use it to apply because if you just try to use your hands with the gloves the solution won&#x27;t rub in. Another downside with the mitt is even if you exfoliate really well it can be a little abrasive so it will rub skin off as you apply to color, which leads to it being uneven. I bought two bottles trusting in the reviews and am not sure I&#x27;ll even finish the first one. To say I&#x27;m disappointed is a major understatement.</li>
            <li> I love the Fake Bake! It works great! I instantly looks like you have a tan and it looks real. It dries really fast too</li>
            <li> Not recommended;the product is not hypoallergenic so if you have a sensitive skin it could be a problem. But the most noticeable downfall is the payout ;it is ok if you don&#x27;t shower......</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner that I have ever used.  I am very fair and I had no problems what so ever.  I also bought the baiden mitten to exfoliate prior to using the tanner and I also used a blending balm on my ankles, knuckles, toes, wrists, elbows and knees.  This self tanner definitely smells better than any other tanner I have ever used but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a tropical scent.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the application mitten either.</li>
            <li> Instant color with no streaking! The color is natural looking, dries fast and I have not noticed any discoloration around my elbows,knees or ankles.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was super easy to use and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with leaking once I cut the stem of the bottle to size. I had absolutely no streaking at all with this product which is wonderful considering how often self banners tend to be streaky. No residue or discoloration left on my sheets or clothing. even if I got sweaty from being outside in the heat the wasn&#x27;t affected.&lt;br /&gt; my only complaint is that I feel like the color plateaued. I live in Wisconsin and after not seeing the sunlight for six months and being pale to begin with, I&#x27;m not much darker and I feel like that color isn&#x27;t getting any darker as I continue use. Will need to buy something with more intense color.</li>
            <li> I bought into the reviews. They must&#x27;ve been planted cause I&#x27;ve been using self-tanner for years and am always on the lookout for better stuff. After reading all the reviews, I was sold. The color went on flawlessly (with the mitt). I was so excited abut my purchase. The next morning, it all washed off in the shower. Very little, if any, color left behind. I&#x27;ve tried it several times, even showering and thoroughly exfoliating beforehand and always the same disappointing results. Side note: Do NOT attempt to rub it in with bare hands!! This stuff will dye your hands! Funny too, cause the rest of your body will still be pale. :-/</li>
            <li> This works great! No streaks and a believable color on my blonde skin. Lots of product, several applications.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Flawless gives you a natural looking tan. The color is not orange. You will get a bronze, brown tan with this product! I received mine quickly and I also got a great price from this seller! You can control how deep you want your tan by multiple applications. You will need to exfoliate your skin first to prepare for your tanning experience. Also, moisturizing your skin will help to prolong your tan. This product is really awesome! I will definitely continue to use Fake Bake Flawless....</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to get into this whole Snookie thing.  But the reviewers are correct.  It is easy to apply, smells good and has  a long-lasting glow.</li>
            <li> First thing, I am pastey white. I burn and freckle, I don&#x27;t tan. Never have, never will. I haven&#x27;t tried a ton of tanning products, just the Jergens lotion and another from Banana Boat, neither of which I&#x27;m super impressed with. I don&#x27;t want to have to put lotion on every day until I reach the tan I want, I just want the darn tan. So I went on a limb and bought Fake Bake, and I don&#x27;t ever need to look for another tanning product. I was concerned I&#x27;d look orange or well, fake, because I&#x27;m so white. I&#x27;m impressed with how natural the tan looks... It lasts a few days and fades evenly. If you&#x27;re looking to get Guido tan from pastey white, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner, better than St Tropez and I think that&#x27;s a good product too. Great seller- Gia&#x27;s Galleria-speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> I just received this product &amp; tried it out. It is by far the best self-tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used --- You have complete control over where it goes and it is easily applied streak-free with the mitt for gradual application. The only quam I have with the product is that the plush fabric on the mitt starts to disintegrate upon use and come off on your skin. Other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li> Heard many good things about this. I received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except it did settle into the pores in my lower legs and it looked like I had a lot more freckles than I have and it does make freckles darken and it freaked me out, when some of my freckles were getting darker. I have had a history of skin cancer, so sun tanning and tanning beds are no longer in my future (and shouldn&#x27;t be your&#x27;s either) - I used a q-tip on the darker freckles and the color came off, so I felt better.  I do have to apply it everyday to get a half way decent color, but I am fair skinned and freckly, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It does stay on after a shower, not all of it, but you still have color.  Exfoliating your skin and using moisturizer is the key too.  It has a great scent going on, but I did get that gross after scent.  It was not near as strong as most of the fake tanners, but I could still smell it, I used a little perfume to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> Like it , creates even and beautiful color but way too much Maintenance. Just ordered fake bake flawless, we&#x27;ll see if that one has better staying power</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and dont have much luck with self tanners but this one has a really great color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that i love this product! The tan is extreamly even as well as real looking. I havent seen a review point these things out, so i hope this helps someone!&lt;br /&gt;*I have someone else assist me in applying. I have never done it on my own. think someone elses eyes can see if it is evenly applied or not&lt;br /&gt;* i do it at night and shower the next day. I have NEVER EVER had it get on my sheets or clothes. I use a towel on my bed the first night just incase but ive NEVER had that issue&lt;br /&gt;* i workout 5-6 days a week and sweat a lot. One of my biggest fears was it streaking. The day after it ONLY streaks around my stomach where i keep my HRM strap. Everywhere else it looks perfect and doesnt look bad on my stomach either but thats the only place i noticed&lt;br /&gt;* it doesnt smell bad or turn my skin green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are a few cons which arent serious&lt;br /&gt;* a lot comes off the first time you shower. BUT for me thats not too bad considering the first time you apply it it can be VERY dark&lt;br /&gt;* it doesnt last long. I have been applying it twice a week for a few weeks and towards the end youre pale again.&lt;br /&gt;A lot comes in the bottle so you could do it every other day if you want that long lasting look. To me its a bit time consuming to do but i may start&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if youre looking for a tan in the winter i recommend this</li>
            <li> I have to say,  I&#x27;m really impressed  by this product. a girl at work who uses fake bake and always has great color,  suggested it to me. I was sort of shocked she used a self-tanner,  because it looked so natural.  I bought a bottle,  still slightly skeptical,  because I have the most difficult  dry skin and even airbrush tans will end up streaking and getting into creases and make me look dirty. not an issue with this product whatsoever! I do put lotion on my more difficult dry area before applying fake bake, which tends to make it last for a short amount of time causing me to apply about 2ce a week to 1ce a week depending on how I feel,  but one bottle will last you for a good little while. definitely worth the purchase and will be purchasing  again soon! highly recommend to anyone starting out or who is skeptical like me!</li>
            <li> I could not love this product more I have finally found my self tanner. I have ordered this many times already and will continue to always !!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Just have to make sure not to get wet went it&#x27;s drying. I had droplet marks after it dried.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m obsessed with spray tans since I have tattoos and don&#x27;t want to ruin them by regular tanning, but it&#x27;s so annoying when I have to waste time out of my day just to go to the tanning salon. I was really hesitant to buy this stuff but read all the awesome reviews and went ahead and bought it and I&#x27;m SO HAPPY with my decision. This stuff is AMAZING. I was kind of terrified that I was going to turn into an Oompa Loompa but it was the opposite. The tan looks so natural and it&#x27;s hella easy to apply! It comes with a mitt and gloves and when it sprays out of the bottle you can see the color to see if it&#x27;s streaking and blend it in as needed. I recommend doing it at night before bed so you can wake up the next morning and shower just to even everything out. I also recommend shaving and exfoliating before applying the product. I use this stuff three times a week to touch up and it only takes seconds! Definitely never going to the tanning salon again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of finding an alternative to going to a tanning bed. This stuff is amazing! However, a couple of things that worked for me that you may want to consider. I only applied this after I showered at night. In the shower, I made sure to exfoliate. Also, the mitten that comes with it works very well, but make sure you have a rubber glove on your hand under the mitten as the liquid absorbs into the glove well and WILL turn your palms orange. And, DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE! If you do, you are guaranteed to look like an oompa-loompa. I just use a normal bronzer powder and I match just fine. This stuff works very well and lasts for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li> I really loved this self tanner. I have a light beige skin tone and after just one application I could see i considerable difference in skin tone. It fades very naturally and doesn&#x27;t get streaky. Also, it is very buildable, so you can get a light tan or a really deep one. I know the directions say to bend your elbows and knees, which you definitely need to! Do that as well for your knuckles if you apply it to your hands.</li>
            <li> I got this so when I went on vacation I didn&#x27;t look like a ghost. I have a tendacy to turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;This Fake Bake was easy to use, you could see where you put it, it gave an instant suntan glow.&lt;br /&gt;I would wash out the mitt about every third use. The only thing I would like with this kit would be a&lt;br /&gt;2nd mitt.&lt;br /&gt;PS this is a review of the 1st bottle bought, I didn&#x27;t want to run out so I ordered a 2nd bottle, several months later when I used it, it was terrible, debated ordering again, broke down ordered 3rd bottle (it is great).. I would recommend if you order additional bottles try them to see if they need to be returned. don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product (or Fake Bake) to anyone.    Pros:  -The color is good, IF you plan to apply it a few times a week.  -It has a pleasant smell.    Cons:  -Basically all washes off in the shower after waiting 24 hours.  -It rubs off on everything!  -Even after exfoliating, the color is patchy.  -Doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.    I contacted Fake Bake regarding my concerns on a product. It took them over a month after my constant tries to contact them for me to even get a reply! Once I did get a reply, they were downright condescending and insulting. Based on my experience, I do not recommend Fake Bake as a company, and I do not recommend this product at all. I will take my hard-earned money to a company who deserves it and has better products.    EDIT:  I got in contact with a Fake Bake representative (mary@fakebake.com) and she stated, and I quote,     \\&quot;We do not sell to Amazon or support their website so your Amazon account would not be of any interest to us.  We will not back any product sold on their website or  E-Bay.  Mary  Customer Service\\&quot;    This clearly says to me that these products could be fake! Beware! It says \\&quot;by Fake Bake\\&quot; but she refused to assist me with my issue because these are not their products.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to take back a positive review that I submitted for this product a couple months ago... I said this would be the only self tanner I&#x27;d use going forward because it didn&#x27;t give my skin that scaly, blotchy look when it started to fade. But it turns out that Fake Bake doesn&#x27;t give me much color at all. Over time, I started to notice that the days I felt at least a little tan were before I&#x27;d taken a shower. The color guide solution in the product that helps you apply it washes off, and little color is left behind. I was having to apply Fake Bake every night just to get my skin to retain a little color.  I&#x27;ve switched to Neutrogena Micro Mist (the dark shade) and I use it with Xen Blending Balm, which helps the color not to collect on your ankles and elbows. Micro Mist is easy to spray on and seems to blend really well.</li>
            <li> Great product, fair price</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product, and said that it is the best self tanner that she has ever used. She has recommended this product to all of her friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works great. Get your spray tan on in like 5 mins rather than 20. No more orange hands!  The mit is awesome.  My Co workers all said how nice of a tan I had.  The only issue I had was that I&#x27;d I would apply it within 15 hours prior to shaving the pores on my legs would be super dark.  It looked like I had hairy legs.  I learned if you apply lotion and wait a while I wouldn&#x27;t get the spots.  Really is flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all types of self tanners,  I decided to purchase this after a review of it I saw on YouTube. It&#x27;s def one of the best I&#x27;ve used, my favorite part is how easy it is to put on and how good it looks on my hands and feet. I DO NOT like how it works on my face it looks blotchy and gets into my pores which is something I&#x27;ve never had a problem with with any other self tanners. This also doesn&#x27;t last me that long I&#x27;m not sure if its cause I use too much each time or what, but each bottle lasts me about 6 applications give or take. Def worth the money to try this product tho, I&#x27;ve already bought 4 bottles so far</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and tips and this is an ok product. I will keep using it until I find something better.&lt;br /&gt;My tips?&lt;br /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t use it right before you go out somewhere. It takes a few hours to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; and you can look dirty at first. It looks best the day after you&#x27;ve showered.&lt;br /&gt;2) Be completely dry when you apply and don&#x27;t go do the dishes or something right away. You&#x27;ll get streaks.&lt;br /&gt;3) I alternate this with the Jergen&#x27;s daily tanner since this isn&#x27;t a good &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments all the time on my tan and how natural it is. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best for the price.</li>
            <li> no scent, instant color (color guide which washes off later but the tan remains) which is perfect for people who procrastinate putting self tanner on until right before they need to be tan...that would be me! haha!</li>
            <li> This by far is the best self tanner I have used, and I have used many. I am light skinned. There is no orange, I don&#x27;t know why other reviews say this. I do notice the green, which I am sure this is to counteract the orange, so, you don&#x27;t want to put this on then leave the house. I put this on before bed, then shower in the morning. I am left with a very natural tan. I just purchased again.</li>
            <li> After reading countless reviews on this item, I decided to give it a try. I am a blonde haired, blue eyed, pale skinned college student looking for something that doesn&#x27;t make me look orange while staying on a budget. I have previously tried Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow. I did like it, but thought this product might be better since it dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes. I have applied this three times now, and I do enjoy it very much. However, it may seem like the application is easy enough, but it isn&#x27;t. if you miss a tiny patch of skin and just need that one part sprayed, it is very hard to get an even tone. Application of the entire body takes me about 15 minutes. I do love that it dries so fast  and that I can get a good tan without risking cancer in tanning beds. I will continue to use this product because for the most part I am very pleased with it. Just make sure you don&#x27;d do anything with water right after your application (like washing your face, brushing your teeth, etc). If even one drop of water goes on your skin within about 5 minutes of your application, it will wash away the product where it landed.</li>
            <li> love this product.... this is the only at home self tanner I like.... the mit is a little cheap  but the over all product is  good</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, I&#x27;ve never been streaky or orange and you know that&#x27;s the biggest no nos for self tanner. The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it fades really fast</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I, or course, shower, shave, and exfoliate before using this but it blends nicely, the color isn&#x27;t orange, but really natural even on lighter or fair skin tones. It&#x27;s rare that it runs off on clothing but even it does, it washes right out! The glove is what makes this product work! Throw away all your self-tanners and purchase this one right now!</li>
            <li> Sellers were very easy right work with. The application is so easy and even. You do need to wear the gloves during application and then you can spray hands and fett at very end to avoid them looking dirty. Otherwise love it. Nice tan look not orange</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and is easy to apply, however, it comes off with the slightest rub or moister. You must let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; for several hours or it will Be on everything but your skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Really nice color.  It is hard to see on the back of your legs, but it goes on nicely with the glove.  I just wish the glove lasted longer.  I have already gone through two gloves and still have half a bottle left.  It has a nice smell also.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, natural looking color, nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Fades rather quickly but in that respect similar to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan&lt;br /&gt;Great product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> While I do like the product, it seems pretty much like all the others as far as a tan color. It does, however, smell much better. Kinda&#x27; like the coconut tanning oils of yesteryear. I will use it because of the nice smell and the tanning is fine.</li>
            <li> This has been the best and most natural self tanner, has a nice smell and very easy to apply with the provided mit</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product ever. So natural and safer than using a tanning bed!! Use it twice a week doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes and dries quick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It works great and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Fool proof, fabulous results!! Fades well. Build-able tan. Have recommend to several friends who also love this product! LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This works great for me. Looks like a real tan...not orange. If you follow the directions and apply in the shower with shower doors closed after you have dried off, when you step out, simply hose down the inside of the shower.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  More of a stain than a self-tanner.  Doesn&#x27;t have that awful self-tanner smell.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several self tanners, but they are always messy or streaky.  Not this product.  The mitt helps the product go on smoothly and evenly without staining your hands.  The best testimony is that the first time I used it a coworker asked if I&#x27;d been out in the sun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one day and I&#x27;m so much darker then I was before! Everyone has already seen the difference in my skin darkness as well! Shipped fast and I love this product so much! Best I have ever tried! Worth the price! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanner I have ever used! I will never need to tan on a tanning bed anymore. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not the best but it will work.</li>
            <li> I bought this produced because it had good reviews and i wanted to get a tan without spending a lot of time in the sun. It smells wonderfully tropical and the color is very believable! Love!</li>
            <li> I got this product a few weeks ago and it works great! I have fair skin, but it looks really natural :)</li>
            <li> I am a pasty white girl with freckles. The sun turns me red and then i peel. I spent my younger years in the tanning beds and with the proper tanning lotions, i&#x27;d get an adequate color but mostly i turned red and more freckled. Once I hit my 30s, I stopped laying in the tanning bed for the sake of wrinkles and started doing the stand up Mystic Tans but I was often disappointed that my $30 went to waste on the orange tan that was streaky in areas and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to wash off. About a year ago I decided to have an airbrushed tan done hoping for better results...the results were better as far as streaks go but it faded soooo incredibly fast that my $25 was wasted. This year before vacation, I decided that I&#x27;d try a self tanner. I did tons of research and fake bake flawless seemed to be the most feasible for the effort I wanted to put in to getting some color on my skin. I ordered it and the morning it came in, i put it on and was very pleased with the initial smell (kinda coconutty...my 10 year old asked what smelled like sunblock so...). I wore it all night. I could tell the sunless tanner smell was on me when I awoke but it wasn&#x27;t very strong (which is what i was going for). I showered and then reapplied and went to work (again, a faint sunless tan smell but not offensive at work) when i got home, i showered again. I applied a total of 3 times and when we were on the plane headed to Mexico, my boyfriend asked if I&#x27;d been tanning in the tanning bed and I told him no, it was fake bake and then he was disappointed that he didn&#x27;t let me spray him down. I&#x27;m pleased with the natural tone this fake bake gives my skin. I do not have an orange hue, but a natural bronze...without the hassel of going to the tanning bed or making an appointment to get a mystic or airbrush. It goes on with a tint so you know where it&#x27;s going. I use it right after showering and lotioning and I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking or clumps of color. Going this route is much cheaper than getting spray on tans and much more convenient. I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color! You may want to place a towel down when you spray it because it does get on floors and walls but wipes right up. I did not notice the color coming off of my skin on to my sheets but I did spray it one time and then went running a few hours later--i do not recommend this! I do, however recommend the product itself!pray on tans and much more convenient. I&#x27;m excited to use this time and time again throughout the winter when I need a little burst of warm color!

I do, however recommend the product itself!</li>
            <li> This stuff is foolproof.  I know because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other fake tanners.  I don&#x27;t have to be ashamed of my pale-as-the-moonlight legs anymore.  You can see it go on so you don&#x27;t look like a total streaky mess an hour later and it gives an instant tan.  One bottle goes a long way.  It still feels just as full some 8-10 applications later as when I got it.  The ONLY thing is that it can take a few layers to get a medium tan.  This doesn&#x27;t concern me though as I just want a little bit of color so it still appears natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say that I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand &amp; type of self tanner on the market. This is my absolute favorite to date! I have blotchy pale skin &amp; am always putting on some type of sunless tanner. I refuse to put my skin through tanning beds anymore. I&#x27;ve learned a ton with age. Fake Bake Flawless is hard to mess up if you take your time &amp; follow the directions. The color guard is shocking at 1st as it is dark, but it washes off. The color left is very natural for me &amp; if you end up with mistakes, you can apply another coat to even it out. This is also the 1st tanner that I can apply (gently pat) to my hands &amp; they even turn out great. I&#x27;m still working on my feet. You can NOT get wet after application. So make sure to apply when you&#x27;ve got time away from all water. Also, this stuff smells amazing &amp; even after a couple of hours, there is barely any of that nasty self tanner smell. Definitely give this one a try! I can&#x27;t live without the stuff &amp; Amazons price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t smudge or turn orange like other self tanners. The mitt and gloves are very helpful and the solution smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, it&#x27;s easy to use and looks great!!! NOT orangy AT ALL!!! (I have an olive complexion with some red undertones) I did not use it for my face though, so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on that, but on the body it looks amazing. The only issue I have with it is that some of it came off at night, actually a lot came off at night. I had to wash all my sheets and comforter the next day, but everything came out, no stains at all. When they got stained, I noticed that the stains were more red than orange, which is why it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a carrot, in my opinion at least. So from then on, I exfoliate int he shower, put it on, and sleep in black pants and black shirt on a brown blanket on top of my bed. It may seem like a hassle to some, but I only tan for special occasions, so I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve tried AT LEAST 5 other self tanners, this is the best  one BY FAR!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful product. Tans like when you go get a spreay tan from a salon but It doesn&#x27;t have the stinky after smell. Smells tropical. I love it. Only problem was after it starts to wear off, you must exfoliate and start over eventually.. maybe after a week or so. I got some spots on my legs where the procuct was left in my pores but after exfoliating, it cleaned uo nicely. WILL buy this again!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. When I ordered this item I also ordered the same product from the Fake Bake company. When I compared the package they look the same but the box was slightly a different color, the bottle was not the same as Fake Bakes bottle (fake bakes bottle was taller and the edges were rounded), and it smells different from the one from fake bake company. They are close in appearance but they are absolutely  different. I decided to try the one from amazon seller first....well I&#x27;m umpa lumpa orange not bronze all over my body. the only reason I will leave my house is because I did not do my hands and face so long sleeves cover the horrendous color. I normally use Tarte brand and it looks awesome after one application. I will be trying the one from Fake bake company this week once all my orange skin disappears to see if the poor color is from the product being old, non genuine or just that fake bake is no good.</li>
            <li> Wow.. i just got this yesterday.. this stuff really works.. amazing!! :D</li>
            <li> Stains sheets/clothes as usual self-tanners do, but looks surprisingly natural and that weird smell you usually get from self-tanners is extremely subtle in comparison to the others.  I used this during/after pregnancy so I didn&#x27;t get pasty white.</li>
            <li> Look like you spent a week at the beach instantly. Goes on smoothly and pretty much foolproof with the mitt and gives dramatic instant results. Smells nice. Not as much upkeep as other tanners which is nice. It fades nicely like a real tan. It may be a little more orangey than other high end tanners but it still looks fine as long as you don&#x27;t do it every day. A lot of people mention exfoliating and putting lotion on dry spots, but even when I skip those steps I don&#x27;t get any patches or streaks in the morning when I wash off the guide color. Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best self tanners for the price and results and there&#x27;s no reason to spend hours laying out and damaging your skin by the sun when you can get an awesome tan really quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a wheelchair so I cannot use a tanning bed so I thought what the heck only 12 dollars now I&#x27;m glad I bought it the second day of using this I have a great tan also its very easy to put on</li>
            <li> Good tanner, I prefer sun in, but this is a bit more affordable. Just make sure you really, really, exfoliate when using this. It will be blotchy if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Alof of people told me this stuff was the best so I thought I would try it. I watched many videos on how to apply it and it work right for me. I turned orange in spots, light tan in others and completely no tan in others. I will not be using or buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Unlike other tanning products, this wont turn you orange. If you absolutely think tan is beautiful then it&#x27;s good. The applicator is good for maybe one or two applications.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives great color and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  Does smell a little after it sets on your skin, but what self tanner doesn&#x27;t? Put an old sheet/towel on the floor before applying. It can be a little messy</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised about this product. I watched all the reviews and read it all so I had a good idea about how great it was but was still blown away! The color is very nice and it smells great! It does look like it washes away when you shower but it just looks like it, there is still color that stays on the skin! Great tanning product, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product seems great at first application - but 80% of the tan washes off in the shower even after waiting hours to let it dry and soak in. Not only that, but after 3 uses, the liquid (yes, liquid NOT lotion) turned green!! GREEN!! Who in their right mind wants to look green?! I understand the attempt to avoid the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; hue, but GREEN?! No no no! I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it arrived quickly and has a very minimal smell compared to most self tanners. Nonetheless, I had such high hopes...crushed. Try it if you feel so inclined. Maybe you will have better luck than I did, but my advice. Keep looking elsewhere for a better product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I am very very pale, from Washington, and don&#x27;t see a lot of sun. I used this before prom and it worked WONDERFUL. Just make sure you exfoliate really well before hand, and really rub it all in. Try not to move your arms if they&#x27;re wet still. IT dries in about 15-20 minutes, and lasts at least 3-4- days. I got a lot of compliments! Best fake-tanning I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for either a quick touch up or all over application! I like that it doesn&#x27;t streak or cause orange blotches around the elbows and ankles!&lt;br /&gt;the color is a nice golden brown, not orange or red. the applicator glove is great too for an even tan.</li>
            <li> Great product, lasts a whole season! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product gives you a very natural-looking tan and is a terrific price compared to getting a spray-tan at a salon.  I like it a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t look artificial and is relatively easy to apply evenly.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, easy to put on and quick results.</li>
            <li> Great product, good natural color. Slight smell but not bad. It lasts if you apply once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the Spring after reading the reviews and I am buying my second bottle. I have fair skin and freckles and do not like to tan but was going to Disney World so I decided to try this. I used his every other day after I showered. I use shea butter on my skin/face before applying to fill in the crevices (elbows/knees/ankles) that usually soak up the tanner and looks like dirt and this does really well. I like the mitt to apply the tanner but it did begin to tear up after multiple uses though. I received many compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and was even warned about it from a dermatologist until I told him it was a self-tanner. ;)</li>
            <li> Great tan without the sun!</li>
            <li> Probably great for unblemished skin. If you have freckles or sun damage this accentuates them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on self tanners, and I did  a wonderful job. The tan looks so natural that no one will be able to tell it&#x27;s fake bake! You have to get this product. Do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus: It smells nice. It doesn&#x27;t fade awkwardly. It lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts so long that I forgot it wasn&#x27;t my actual tan D:.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice color but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It feels that part of it goes away when you take the first shower.</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly not as dark as I hoped but still the smoothness and evenness makes up for it. I recommend this for anyone who hates streaks.</li>
            <li> I am an expert on sunless tanners. I have used every drugstore brand, Avon products, and expensive department store and salon brands. I am very good at expertly applying these products and have achieved some very good results.&lt;br /&gt;However, Fake Bake has definitely raised the bar!  It is a fantastically easy to use product that gives the best tan I have ever had without the sun. It does not have that horrible sunless tanner smell. It does not rub off on your bed linens.&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a realistic, dark tan that gets you constant compliments. Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. Although its kind of a pain to apply ... It does the job! Im as white as you could possibly be And i get compliments on my tan everyday. Ive tried other products that are easier to apply but they made me turn orange! This product although it has an amazing color... It can be streaky if you arent careful. A little goes a long way so dont use to much or it looks really streaky. And make sure you get under your arms really well. Its easy to miss. Always use lotion before hand!</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF.  LASTS WELL THROUGH SHOWERS ON YOUR LEGS IF YOU DON&#x27;T SCRUB IT OFF.  HIGHLY IMPROVES THE LOOK OF YOUR EXTREMITIES WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SCARS AND DISCOLORIZATION.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m pretty surprised on the reviews and the scale of the emotions some users express.&lt;br /&gt;This is a cosmetic product.It works for some,and doesn&#x60;t for others.&lt;br /&gt;The success of using depends on so many factors.&lt;br /&gt;First read a lot about the product before you use it.Find out if it worth to try and you want to spend the time, money effort to experiment with it.It takes time to find out for your skin and match that to your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x60;t use it first time before some important event - to be shocked or be surprised on the results ( good or bad way).&lt;br /&gt;Like with any product it can have short comings and it takes time to learn how to use/apply successfully and adjust the practice to your liking.I have very light skin tone with natural blonde hair,blue eyes, and it takes very long time to tan naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive dry skin, and gave up on using tanning beds long time ago because of the drying effect, what I couldn&#x60;t tolerate and/or counter with any level of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x60;s being said here are some of my thoughts about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- try it when you have the time, and when you do not have any important appearances;&lt;br /&gt;-try it with a friend or partner( easier to apply, more eyes can see more, and correct more)Make sure the partner is honest :);&lt;br /&gt;-exfoliate a day before and do not use creams or body lotions before( except a light layer on palms,knees,elbows;&lt;br /&gt;-DON&#x60;T USE THE GIVEN MITT, purchase a separate one from Beautisol ( Amazon sells it)- the difference is significant,Fake Bake&#x60;s is just a sponge with no barrier layer, that&#x60;s why they provide the rubber gloves, Beautisol&#x60;s have an extra waterproof layer in the sponge side of the mitt, protecting your hands from any unwanted layers of color;&lt;br /&gt;- apply small amounts at a time 1-2-3 puffs, so you can control the amount and color-I found it easy to apply, but you have to work fast and have a light hand,with long movements and circular ones too;&lt;br /&gt;-have a set of underwear, lounge pants and top,robe,pajama, hoodie etc with earth  colors,BROWN!, what you can wear in the next hours, and put on  after applying the tanning product- I have brown towels,and sheet set also for these occasion, no reason to&lt;br /&gt;mess up anything,and even if staining would happen- you don&#x60;t feel sorry,and everything washable( so instead of vining, be prepared);&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x60;t shower for at least 5-6 hours after applying FB;&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x60;t wear white or very light /expensive clothing right after applying- or make sure you wipe off the dried excess product with a dry white wash cloth;&lt;br /&gt;-I apply make up after using FB -no problem;&lt;br /&gt;- FB is significantly changes my skin tone for the better, but it doesn&#x60;t last for me for a week - unless you don&#x27;t use shower regularly every day,&lt;br /&gt;so I enhance the results on my legs arms, and chest,neck with Nivea sunkissed legs lotion;&lt;br /&gt;-YES the shower will take off a big amount of the color;&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x60;t have issues with the scent- I think all of the self tanners have a significant odor,until  somebody will find a better chemical what reaches the same effect;&lt;br /&gt;-make sure that you have smooth skin when applying- shave and make sure you are careful around the eyebrows, or if you have facial hair take care of it a couple day earlier;&lt;br /&gt;Practice and accept the possible results! There&#x60;s no perfect product, but everybody can learn if this one works for her or not.&lt;br /&gt;It is not bad, but I wish it would last  and stay longer on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot of work, when you don&#x27;t have naturally tan skin- just to keep up.So I use it for special occasion and try keep it while having my daily routine of hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;I wish with face cleaning(I use creams with pads and water) wouldn&#x27;t wash off most of the tan.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x60;t forget- this is not a body lotion, so if you have dry skin you have to hydrate a couple hours later- and that process will rub off some of the tan also.&lt;br /&gt;FB doesn&#x60;&#x60;t stay on too long in swimming pools -I wish somebody can offer one for SWIMMERS!&lt;br /&gt;FB does not have any SPF properties - so that is your responsibility to apply when showing off around the pool, or on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;If you go on a vacation bring all the stuff you need to use it and reapply depending on the activities.&lt;br /&gt;Good lucko long in swimming pools -I wish somebody can offer one for SWIMMERS!&lt;br /&gt;FB does not have any SPF properties - so that is your responsibility to apply when showing off around the pool, or on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;If you go on a vacation bring all the stuff you need to use it and reapply depending on the activities.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> dude checking in here. can only compare this to loreal sublime bronze and banana boat for light skin and this product is far superior to either . Loreal is for women and has glitter in it, streaking and just looks bad and smells worse. banana boat just didn&#x27;t really tan very well at all. i have light skin tone, but it was an incredibly ineffective product. i could barely tell the difference. both did not do well with body hair at all and you could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now first off guys if your new to this. exfoliate. this is not recommendation but a requirement. if you don&#x27;t know how to go about it then google it. i use shea suger body stuff in lime as it has the least odor. or just use apricot scrub on the cheap. trust me. otherwise you will be found out immediately as i made that mistake and it comes out totally uneven and almost like a worn out leather kinda look. never again. never again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review:&lt;br /&gt;i was somewhat nervous as it was a liquid spray and i thought it might be too extreme or leave alot of marks but found that it spread very well over skin and the application mitt is now a mandatory for me regardless of what i end up using down the road. the biggest and easiest give away you self tan is the palms of your hands and  streaks on the side of your hands and fingers. regardless of whether you get this product or not, get a mitt as well. i have alot of calluses on my hands from golfing and lifting so it was even more so obvious for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also what is required is to be moisturized wherever you are applying it. don&#x27;t apply this to dry skin, but wait maybe 10min after you are moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use this on my legs arms chest back and face neck and after using it for maybe 3 weeks now i am maintaining the tan i got over the summer and it looks very natural as long as you don&#x27;t go overboard or do it without a mirror. just do each section of your body at a time in front of a mirror to ensure you miss nothing. rub it in in circular motion and if you have abs you can do little tricks to highlight them a little bit which i do from time to time. also another great thing is that it does well with body/arm/leg hair and even my perma-5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I found it best that after i am done rubbing it in, my last swipes i try to make my hair on my arms/legs &amp;#34;stand up&amp;#34; so they dont stick to my body and affect the tanning process in any way. don&#x27;t know how much that matters, but seems reasonable and i imagine for the haireir guys this would be mandatory to avoid weird streaking patterns.  I would be careful about your mustache though. i generally shave it now before i tan cause it is disproportionate to the rest of my face in regards to the shade i end up with. so no big deal really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have heard good thing about tanning mouse for men and will definitely give that a shot as well as that is known to work great with hair as well and is generally suggested for dudes and may come back and adjust this review if need be after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but as of now, i&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product and would suggest it to a friend (who knows how to keep secrets).... kinda don&#x27;t get the stigma around guys self tanning... tans make people look better/healthier and it reduces chance of skin cancer... it&#x27;s the most logical manner in which to acquire a tan... models do it. celebrities do it, but it&#x27;s ok cause they make money off their looks... well i just want to look better and healthier and now i do and will continue to unabashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so go out there and tan my brothers!</li>
            <li> This product left me a bit orange but not horribly. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad so  I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am an older redhead. This product made the light freckles across my shins and ankles POP!  And they looked orange. Like I was splattered with .......a substance. It went on looking great and then it went horribly wrong. Guess I will no longer try to change my pale. Embrace the pale. This product was not for me....and my freckles.</li>
            <li> well, it def. left streak marks</li>
            <li> love love the best ever.....</li>
            <li> as fake tanners go this works pretty well put it&#x27;s rally messy. I&#x27;m rather white.... no.... i&#x27;m casper.... i&#x27;m glow in the dark!!! and this product does not make me look orange which is nice, but again it is messy. it also can streak if not applied correctly. I think i may stick to spray tans...</li>
            <li> I am pale beyond pale. If you need a tan because you&#x27;re wearing a dress or shorts then here&#x27;s your product. I allowed my mom to use it once and she stole it from me. She said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s mine now.&amp;#34; And coveted the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;If you are also pale and are ashamed, pick this up. It&#x27;s easy to see and layer.</li>
            <li> It was streaky and it made me itchy. However, it was the first self-tanner that I have used that doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty soup (AKA: DHA).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks natural, dries fast, smells great and lasts even after showering a few times.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and everytime I try a self tamner it hardly works, but I bought this and received it today I used and so far I love it. It smells great came sealed and I love the tanning mitt it makes it so easy to use. I am going to buy the barrier cream and everything else by Fake Bake ASAP!</li>
            <li> Great color, no streaking and most important No after smell!!</li>
            <li> Well what a big old mess ..  I have used worse that&#x27;s for sure - but I expected a lot better results using this after reading the reviews - I of course exfoliated and made sure I had no product (lotion) on before application .. Oh I was a bit of a streaky mess - I suppose I am so used to using Tan Towels even tho they don&#x27;t really provide a dark tan, there is no streaking of the skin....  I had to use a remover in order to go outside! I have about 97% left and I will never use it or order again..</li>
            <li> Living in an area that doesn&#x27;t get that much sun, I&#x27;ve found this looks realistic, and I wear it almost all year round except for the summer months when the sun comes out. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it for my H.S. Reunion and it works.  Very simple and clean to use.  No mess and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> This product really does work good! The mit really helps and the spray on. I recommend you spray on mit then rub the substance on your body! It really makes you look tan and not orange at all! it lasts a long time too. It can be streaky if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing the first time you are applying it but nothing practice can&#x27;t change! I highly recommend this to anyone that wants an easy cheap fake tan without looking like an ompa lumpa!</li>
            <li> Just like the darker one but not to dark. I love this one and the darker one. The most darkest natural looking tan you can buy!!! Will never use anything else again. Finally a company that mastered the fake tan in a bottle!!! So happy &amp; will never purchase another kind of self tan again!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters , right? She says that the supplied glove helps to not get &amp;#34;streaking&amp;#34; marks.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS TANNER.. IT GIVES ME A REALLY NICE BRONZE GLOW, ONLY THING IS IT WASHES OFF IN LIKE 2-3 DAYS SO YOU HAVE TO TAN YOURSELF ATLEAST TWICE A WEEK TO MAINTAIN COLOR. THE BOTTLE DOES LEAK IF YOU SHAKE IT. I USUALLY ONLY USE THE SPRAY APPLICATOR WHEN I TAN THEN I REPLACE IT WITH THE INITIAL CAP. AND THEN I JUST SET IT STANDING UP LIKE ON MY DRESSER AND THAT PREVENTS IT FROM LEAKING EVERYWHERE. GREAT PRODUCT THOUGH !</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that this is by far the very best self tanning product I have ever used, and I have used ALOT of different products! I have pretty fair skin and melanoma runs in my family so I avoid tanning beds and excessive sun exposure but a beautiful tan looks so healthy. This tanning product is super quick to apply and when you first put it on it smells very tropical like a coconut kind of scent. After wearing this product for a little while it does get a typical self tanner smell but it is a soft scent and not nearly as overwhelming as other self tanners. I use the fake bake flawless at night right before bed after I have already brushed my teeth and done anything else that I need to do that requires using water. This stuff literally takes 10 mins tops to apply and dries almost instantly, there is absolutely no wait time before you can get dressed. Typically, with other products, I have a hard time getting my whole body tanned evenly, including my hands and feet. With other tanners my face, hands, and feet are usually blotchy and streaked but that does not happen with fake bake flawless. It has a very nice natural brown color and a color guide that allows you to see where you have tanned. Even if you get extra product in one spot it evens out very nicely after you shower. I have not had any blotching or streaking with this formula and it is gradual and buildable! Make sure you exfoliate and moisturize before using and apply to clean skin! For elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and hands I apply a thin layer of lotion as a barrier before tanning so it does not settle in to the dryer parts of my body and come out darker than the rest of my body. This product comes with latex gloves and a tanning mit. The mit is a life saver and makes it so easy to apply the product evenly! I do recommend rinsing the mit after each use so that the tanner does not build up and make it gross. I have my boyfriend rinse it for me so I don&#x27;t mess up the tan on my hands! I love this product and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I&#x27;m pregnant so I&#x27;m not really supposed to go tanning at the salon, so I was desperate to find a self tanning lotion that wasn&#x27;t gonna hurt the baby, but also made me dark.  Then I found this!  I really do love it.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and isn&#x27;t streaky.  If you&#x27;re going to use it a lot, I recommend exfoliating really well each time you use this stuff!!!  I used it today before work on my arms and feet and my arms look terrible lol.  Where your arm bends, it&#x27;s a different color.  But really only I can notice it and it isn&#x27;t that bad, plus it&#x27;s my fault for not exfoliating first!  It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, and it smells amazing.  Like a tropical sunblock scent.  Love it and I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.. The color is great (very realistic tan/ not orange at all) However, it&#x27;s very messy to use. Its a spray nozzle and the spray gets everywhere. The mitt is too small and falls off your hand. The mitt  also twists and bunches up on your hand. You have to struggle to keep the mitt in place. I have very small hands, so I can&#x27;t imagine how inconvenient it must be for someone with larger hands. The color itself does not last long. I found that I had to reapply every 2-3 days to keep a tan. This is a bit too high maintenance for me as far as up keep goes. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I love love love this so much I am buying more! My favorite ever! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> i ordered this product for my redhaired fair skinned daughter. we have both used countless other products in the past. after reading the reviews and hints others have given we decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;although i have not used it myself yet, my daughter has and absolutley loves the results. it is easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;using the mitt that comes with it. she didnt get the darker areas around elbows and knees like others have caused. after one use, the color was a subtle natural color. the next night she reapplied it and looked like she had spent a few days on the beach. it says to then only apply once weekly to maintain. so far she has used very little so at this rate, the bottle will last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;best of all, no scent like others have had. that was always the worst part for me.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product at ultra.  So glad that I found it here at a better price.  I use this weekly and it works great.  No streaks at all</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner. Its very easy to use and does not give a gross orange look that most self tanners do. This tanner gives a very natural tan that looks great on all skin tones. I&#x27;ve purchased this for a couple of my closest friends and they are so happy.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this product in the past.  This particular one seems sort of &#x27;expired&#x27; or something.  It is kind of streaky but can work if you apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with it but in the past this company has delivered perfectly so I am writing this off as just a bad product.</li>
            <li> This product was O.K. Definitely not worth the cost versus other products I&#x27;ve used. Yes, it tans you pretty well with one application. But it does not last after showering. I applied for several days in a row and the bronzer did not stay on as I had hoped for...</li>
            <li> I only applied this once for a trip to a water park in the middle of winter and it really took the pasty-ness away.  Was easy to apply and really no mess at all.  Going to try to apply a couple of nights in a row to get a darker shade.  Overall, nice product.</li>
            <li> I heard that self tanners are bad, they streak, look orange, etc. but I found this one from a review off of youtube decided to try it. Im really glad I did. Its easy to use and smells like suntan lotion. I found it in Ulta but its too expensive there so I will by from amazon again and again thanks</li>
            <li> It is safe to say that I&#x27;m pretty much obsessed with this product... I absolutely LOVE it!!! I bought it for my mom for her birthday and ended up getting the two-pack set. I used it first and just fell in love and so did she! The first time I wore it to work everyone was asking me if I had been in the tanning bed, although I didn&#x27;t want to share my secret I just had to tell them! I was able to apply the product in the morning and wear it all throughout the day without looking orange or streaky. It has a smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t stink, like some people have mentioned on here. Anyway, I love love love this product and I even went so far to buy all of Fake Bake&#x27;s products. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Not the best. Most of color washes off in the Shower next day. Smells great, not streaky. Not much of a color payoff.</li>
            <li> This product is so-so. I had a semi orange look. Maybe it was me, because after a few uses, I received the same result. I’m not impressed. I didn’t want to waste it so I gave it to my friend but she ended up throwing it away because it irritate her skin.  Try Bronzbody, it’s worth the bang for your buck. The color goes on evenly and the bottle lasts.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product, after reading MANY reviews, in an attempt to find a substitute for the tanning bed. I had decided to not tan until tanning season, but practically hate myself when I have no color. Now, I love being able to put a layer or two of this stuff on before going out at night it really gives me the tan look, but I do not feel comfortable wearing it during the day. I have tried it now for two months on both pale and tan skin and have gotten comments about my orangeness from a few close friends when I sport it during the day. DO NOT listen to people saying it doesn&#x27;t wash off immediately because it absolutely does. As I said before I had read many reviews and decided to trust in those that said all that washes off is some &amp;#34;color guard&amp;#34; or whatever...yeah, no. It&#x27;s the color that&#x27;s washing off. I am 100% back to my original pallor after a shower. Also, yes it does come off on any whites you have - sheets, shirts, hats - so I tend to just use the stuff on my arms and face and shower before bed.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m glad I got it. It has proven useful when I&#x27;m looking kinda sickly pale and can just slap some on (dries super quickly and yes, smells good) for a night out or when I wear certain tan-only colors and I personally like that it washes right off. But if you are looking for a more permanent fake bake look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> No streaks, quick and easy. Great product. Perfect price point</li>
            <li> After watching video after video on you tube I finally caved in and ordered this product. 2 days later it arrived and I tried the product right away.uch like the videos I noticed it had a very tropical/coconut smell to it unlike the usual self tan smell. When I woke up I smelt like chocolate once again not your typical tanner. It was easy application and my tan was tan not the least bit orange. I have tried other self tanners and this one is my favorite by far!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am NOT orange! I have received so many compliments on my Fake Bake tan. I work in the medical field and must always look professional and presentable to all, everyday I received at least 2 comments about the tan. When I tell them I did it myself, they are so impressed and ask what product is used. I have recommended this product countless times. The color is so natural looking, I&#x27;m a bronzed beauty with this product. It&#x27;s so easy to apply with the mitten, however you must take your time and really make sure you apply it correctly and stay away from water, sweat, or the rain. Or else you will be a splotchy mess. I love this product and plan to continue buying their products. I also purchased the Fake Bake Aerosol Can, I use that on my face it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with the inability to tan. I look pasty yellow. I bought this item and was not disappointed at all! it&#x27;s not orange when applied, and it dries quickly. It looks like a real tan; not some Jersey Shore Oompa Loompa monstrosity. I highly recommend it. When I plan on wearing shorts/dress it, I apply this the night before because I&#x27;m very self-conscious about my white legs. This really boosted my confidence!</li>
            <li> Easy apply looks much more natural than most.</li>
            <li> I have been using every type of sunless tanner for the past year. Jergens, loreal, banana boat, etc. each and every one just built up and started to look awful, and unnatural. After experimenting and so much research about the perfect tan I can across fake bake flawless and million dollar tan icon. I bought both. I used fake bake first, and felt like it was good product. I showered the next morning, and most of it washed off, so I though why not apply million dollar tan and see what happens. Once I did that the next day I had an amazing \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, a bronze \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I have been applying fake bake once a week and then tan icon on Fridays to get a little glow for the weekend. Fake bake is a great product, for a simple tan.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely not for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading numerous reviews and watching a half dozen tutorial videos on youtube, I decided to try this for my very fair skin. I had read that people with fair skin had good luck, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it yesterday, showered, exfoliated then applied it. I did apply it directly to the mitt and rubbed in small circular motions doing just one part of my body at a time, upper arm/shoulder, lower arm, upper leg, lower leg, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that wherever the mitt initially touched my skin after spraying the product on it, it stained my skin, it didn&#x27;t spread. As I rubbed it on, it went on smoothly, but where it first touched my skin, it left a splotchy mark that I couldn&#x27;t get evened out. I don&#x27;t know how some people spray it directly on their skin (watch some of the youtube videos, those girls are brave!), I would be a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews that I read stated the scent was Hawaiian or tropical smelling, but I don&#x27;t think so. It smelled just like all the other self tanners, stinky. It was worse when I got up this morning, I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got up this morning I was completely yellow (not orange, but yellow. I looked jaundiced!) and splotchy all over, arms, legs, spots that I rubbed several times were practically bare. Could I have rubbed it too much and some of the product rubbed off perhaps??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, this is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say there are a couple of positives....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After smoothing it on as evenly as I could, it was dry as most people have stated, so that was a plus. And the mitt applicator was very soft, but I don&#x27;t know how effective it was if I noticed splotchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to my Designer Skin Tinted Love moisturizer, I&#x27;ve had great luck with it and was just wanting to mix it up a bit. Guess I should just stick with a good thing when I have it! :)</li>
            <li> This was the best sunless tanner I have EVER used! Didn&#x27;t turn orange and I love the mit to use for application. It really went on smooth and looked so natural. I even used it on my face (eek)...I was nervous) but I just blotted it on with the left overs on the mit and it turned out lovely! I would definately order this again!</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice color brown not orange ,but I do think if u over do it than it may get orange .I use it 1-2 times a week.It is a good product easy to use and I get a lot of compliments on the nice color as well as disbelief that it is a spray tan.Don&#x27;t forget to layer it,sometimes i will do this 2 times  in one day to get the color I want or 2 days in a row but that is important you will be disappointed if you don&#x27;t layer it!!hope this helps</li>
            <li> Works very well but be careful when you put in on your hands and feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have VERY pale skin. We are talking ivory with pink undertones pale skin. I should also mention that I do NOT tan in the tanning bed. I cannot count how many differnt tanning products that I have tried attempting to give myself a natural looking tan. Some of them made me look like an Oompa Loompa, others didn&#x27;t appear to do anything, and others were just okay. This product is AMAZING! It gives my pale skin the most natural looking tan I have been able to acheive from a bottle. The color that you get from it is very natural (not an orange that doesn&#x27;t exist in nature) and the glove lets anyone apply it flawlessly. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am definitely into sunless tanning, and have tried just about everything out there! From drugstore to high end. I only prefer the high end products, they just tend to be better. Anyway, I have been using ST TROPEZ mousse for a couple years and love the color and it&#x27;s fool proof, but very expensive, so I found this fake bake here on amazon and read some reviews and thought I would give it a try since it was so inexpensive! It came with gloves and a really nice mitt! I&#x27;m used to a more greenish undertone and this looked kinda red, but I gave it a try, and I LOVE IT!!! It smells amazing! Is even easier to apply, dries quickly. And doesn&#x27;t get all over my sheets or clothes!!! And is actually a beautiful bronze tan! This is now my new favorite! LOVE IT! And highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Okay, people I have been using self tanner on and off since middle school and now I&#x27;m at the ripe old age of 34. So trust me on this! I love this product, gone are the days of orange streaks and smelly clothes! Fake Bake delivers a natural tan with a pleasing scent. I&#x27;ve tried an array of self tanners including Xen Tan as well as all of the drug store brands and this is by far my favorite! Application is fail safe, they include a mit, which makes it easy to apply! Try it, you&#x27;re going to love it!!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product . Hard to apply and yes I used the lotion before and the mitt that goes with it. Will not order again and threw remainder, after first application , in garbage !</li>
            <li> This is a great product - the tan looks natural and is very easy to do!!!!  Will buy again.  I would recommend applying it before bed time so that it does not stain your cloths.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product if you are ridiculously pale like I am. It gives you a nice brown colour instead of orange. The only downside to this is that it goes away so quick (at least for me) it&#x27;s not dark enough. I mean it&#x27;s dark for the first night but the night after I feel much lighter. Still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for streaking, I used to have trouble with that issue but it seems to be ok now, you just have to spray and rub the product in quick (or find whatever works for your body/skin).</li>
            <li> Love the color, driest fast, you can see what it is that your putting on. The mit is pure genius!!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this she loves it,the best anywhere,will be purchasing more soon,no orange color,it goes on great,and no bad smell whatsoever !!!!!!!!!!love it</li>
            <li> LOVE this self tanner for so many reasons. It actually smells good!  No trace of that usual self tanner odor. I use the fake bake exfoliation gel as well. The tanning spray applies so perfectly with the mitt. I have thrown out my arsenal of self tanners and will never use anything but fakebake ever again</li>
            <li> I wanted to review this after using for a couple weeks to be able to share some pros, cons and some tips! I think the color is great! Super natural, a nice bronze color as if I live on a tropical island and spend all day outside! Im naturally fair skinned, but tan well. This didn&#x27;t look fake or orange and smells great! Here are some of my cons, which won&#x27;t make me stop using it. The first is- the smell after it settles isn&#x27;t pleasant (baked skin smell), but I can get past it. Secondly, when I shave and use it, it tends to color in the pores on the lower portion of my legs. This isn&#x27;t noticeable from far away and it hasn&#x27;t been something I&#x27;ve been able to fix. Third, the mitt got scraggly and pilled even after the first use! Some of which came off on my skin, but was easily wiped away. I ended up shaving the mitt to get the stuff off. Here are some tips- EXFOLIATE EXFOLIATE EXFOLIATE! No matter what, you must exfoliate before putting it on- even if it&#x27;s your second application for the week. I made the mistake of not exfoliating once and had weird blotchy spots from where the tanner applied previously was still on me. My other tip is- don&#x27;t wear white right afterwards. I&#x27;ve noticed that it does stain the white clothes, sheets, etc. At first this was extremely alarming...my white sheets were ORANGEY PINK! But I used OxiClean today and no trace of a stain to be seen! Yay! So yes, this product isn&#x27;t perfect but I&#x27;ve never had such nice glowing, bronzed skin like I do now! I love it and it&#x27;s well worth some of the faux pas that I can overlook. Give it a try! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Orange, I have also decided I prefer lotion to spray, it wears off terrible and all around sucks for the price. Do yourself a favor and go to Sally&#x27;s for 7.99 and get Tanwise lotion. I have tried about 8 sunless tanners and Tanwise beats them all for Color, Ease of application, how long it lasts, and how well it fades, the smell and (this is a big one) it doesn&#x27;t cause bumps. The only negative thing that I can say about Tanwise is a few of the tanners I have tried are darker than Tanwise after first application, but for the price and how easy it is to use, just apply it a few days in row to build it up.</li>
            <li> Best fake tan ever!!!!!!!!  Totally worth your money.  You don&#x27;t even need to exfoliate each time you use it.  I would recommend getting a spray oil moisturizer to use on knees, elbows, ankles, etc. prior to using this.  If you put it on sparingly and add to it after it dries it&#x27;s fabulous.  No streaking at all!  Plus it&#x27;s not clear so you can see where you&#x27;re putting it on.  It has an even bronze color.  Not orange at all.  Go for it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunless tanner that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on perfectly. I&#x27;ve used other self tanners that smell awful but this is the best by far! Last 4-5 days</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it was as good as the 2 I&#x27;ve used in the past that have both disappeared from the market.  It is  pretty much the same.  Just more expensive, but that is probably due to better packaging.  It has a nice brown color when applied.  As it develops, I have the same issue with blotches and streaks that I can get with any self tanner.  Success is largely in the technique.  Exfoliation and barrier creams are important. But no matter how good the product, a fake tan never hides the flaws or glows from deep within the skin like a natural tan does. So don&#x27;t get your hopes too high. But who needs skin cancer?  The fact that this product is packaged as a spray with the application mitt and rubber glove probably means it will stick around. Liquid tanner in a squeeze tube is kind of a mess, and I&#x27;m sure that is why the other products didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> I do my spray tanning everyday. I love this tanning spray. It goes on my skin smoothly and is safe on my skin. My skin is sensitive, so when I found this product I was excited. I even went and ordered 2 more to keep for when I run out!</li>
            <li> I convinced my bf to let me give him his first tan. Lucky me, he was impressed with the results. It goes on very smoothly and evenly and lasts for a solid week.</li>
            <li> It gives good color but I&#x27;ve used much better self tanner and of course paid more... so this is a good buy for the price. I would suggest exfoliating really well and using a light application working up to the amount of tan desired (using very light around fingers, arm creases, etc), I also used it before going in the sun which gave best results.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned person and this gave me a beautiful tan (with out streaks) on the first application. I put a little more on the next day for a little darker tan. I am so pleased to not look like a carrot and not smell funky. The only problem I had was some coming off on my pajamas as I let it set over night, so don&#x27;t wear nice pj&#x27;s with this stuff. So glad my sister talked me into trying Fake Bake, I am now a bronze beauty. :)</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it makes me itchy. But i like the color and its easy to apply so sometimes i just use it anyway. Will it make everyone itchy? No. It&#x27;s probably just my skin. But saying that i use it anyway because it gives a good self tan says something doesnt it? It goes on even and fades pretty evenly too which i like</li>
            <li> Excellent product everyone borrowing it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gives a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I have found the golden tanning ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix these 2 together, apply every 2 days, and you will be a silken golden tan goddess for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries about streaking like with spraying Fake Bake alone. Much darker color than Moist Hemp Bronzing lotion alone. You get the dark bronze from Fake Bake with the DHA and intense moisture from Moist Hemp Bronzing lotion. The best of both worlds. Plus it smells great and your skin will feel like silk! You&#x27;ll look more radiant too since your skin will be hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes maybe 5 minutes to apply lotion to your entire body. I even put it on my face! Mix it with q-tips so your hands don&#x27;t get orange and wash them when you&#x27;re done. Since the mixture is darker, you can even see if you have any dark patches you need to mix in more. Wait 10 minutes to dry and then don&#x27;t wash it off for at least a few hours or even a full day! The bronzer and the DHA need time to develop. I&#x27;m ghostly pale and this is the perfect medium bronze for me! Plus you&#x27;ll see results immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love this! I get so many compliments on my tan. Make sure you wash your mitt and exfoliate 1 time per week.  I use this 2 times per week to keep a constant natural glow.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and works well, just doesn&#x27;t get very dark, even after multiple applications. Nice, natural glow though!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars if possible!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;Does not wash off or stain clothes&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fake bake flawless is incredible! I haven&#x27;t been to a tanning,bed in a long time but people always tell me I have good skin tone now! And I got it so quick with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have red hair, blue eyes, and YUP! You guessed it...fair, freckled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to stay, I have to be careful with fake tanners. Just one wrong product choice and I&#x27;ll have orange skin to match my red hair. Not what I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake is different. It smells GREAT, it works QUICKLY, and you&#x27;ll actually look TAN, not orange, streaky, or any other bizarre color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another kind of self tanner again. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Buy it. You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Definitely.</li>
            <li> product works just like it says. had a nice bronze look and it looked very nice. By far the best tanner ive used.</li>
            <li> Product does deliver both immediate and gradual results but washes off so quickly that it needs constant re application.  The mitt disintegrates more with each use and is not ideal for face applications, as it does not distribute evenly onto face. I do get compliments on my tan and the naturalness of the color often so that&#x27;s a big plus.  All in all the products beats being a slave to the (killer) tanning beds but requires more at home maintenance than I originally thought it would</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it all right away and went to use it a month or so later. it had turned GREEN! When i tried it on me it turned me green! Thank goodness i tried it where i could cover it up.  So make sure you use it fast and don&#x27;t use it if it looks green!</li>
            <li> This product is SO MUCH BETTER than any gradual tanning lotion you can buy at the store. The color is instant, there is no smell or sticky feelings. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. The ONLY thing that I learned when using this is... do not use it right after you have shaved your legs. Maybe wait 24 hours after shaving to apply it. I&#x27;m pretty sure they told me this when I got sprayed professionally at a salon, but I must have forgotten it. It will make your legs have little brown spots all over if you apply right after a fresh shave. Just FYI!</li>
            <li> Alot of fun, and look good at the same time!</li>
            <li> So-so results, difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth. Came with handy mit. Very nice tanning product. I would defenetly repurchase it again. Doesn&#x27;t have the same odor as many other tanning products do.</li>
            <li> This is my second year using Fake Bake...I love all their products but flawless is my favorite! I love the mitt...I also use the mitt with the other fake bake tanners as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner!!! I love it so much and I am so glad I found it. I works brilliantly and does not smell bad. It smells like coconuts which I love. If you are not a fan of that scent, you may not like this. If you follow the directions you will have a believable looking tan. I have light/medium golden skin and it looks just like my skin when it is tan. It is a little bit of a labor of love to apply it correctly. This what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Cleanse and Exfoliate: Either use a good sugar scrub or get an exfoliating mitt. I love the kae exfoliating hamman glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Apply a light moisturizer to elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Apply the spray as directed. Do not spray directly on the skin. Spray small amounts of tanner in the glove and swipe in long sweeping motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Use blending cream or balm on elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and wrists. I like xen tan blending balm. It also has a faint smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Wash hands, especially if you run out of the gloves sent with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like to do to give my face a glow is to spray a squirt in my face lotion and blend evenly. I mainly use it on my face, neck, arms during the fall and winter. In the spring and summer I will do most of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasts and lasts. If you treat your mitt well it last long enough. I wash mine with my shampoo until it runs clear, wring it out gently, and hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, cut about one inch off the straw or the bottle will leak. I did that and was able to travel with it. Enjoy! This is the best out there and you can&#x27;t beat the price on here. It is a lot better for your skin than tanning, and a lot better for your lungs than a spray tan.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot! Only streaks if you aren&#x27;t paying attention or don&#x27;t exfoliate first. It smells like coconut and not at all like most self tanners. Natural looking, not orange (and I&#x27;m fair skinned). You can build the color from a light/medium tan to dark. I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many of these products, and all I can say about this product, IS I LOVE IT! It is so easy to use, the gloves and mitt that comes with it, help so much with the application. ....does not make you look orange and works wonders on and around the foot area which is one of the hardest to look natural. I will never but another sunless tanning product other than this....I can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading all of the awesome reviews. I saw a blog about it on pinterest also so I thought I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to put on. The directions were great. I had no problems with the pump, and in fact you really dont need to use the pump anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a great nice even tan. I used one of the tan balms on my elbows and knees so that I wouldn&#x27;t have uneven patches on those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HUGE problem I have with this is that it is left behind EVERYWHERE. My pillow, blankets, sheets, car seat, chairs at a friends house (embarrassing) etc. It comes off on anything that it touches. And besides at night because I don&#x27;t know if I was sweating or not, I wasn&#x27;t sweating. It&#x27;s been in the 40s-50s here and the stuff is still coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is really the only problem that I had with it, but to me it&#x27;s a pretty big problem! I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with any other product that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did give me the most natural, most even fake tan that I&#x27;ve ever had though. So from that perspective I&#x27;m very happy with it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again though.</li>
            <li> I am pale pale pale pale and I have tried every fale tanning product under the sun. This one is hands down the best I have ever used. People complained about the straw being too long, but I trimmed a few inches off of mine and it works perfectly. The color guide is a little orangey but once you wash it off you are left with a golden tan. When you are putting the product on, it doesn&#x27;t have the fake tan smell, but when I woke up in the morning I could smell it a little. It did rub off on my sheets, but that&#x27;s to be expected. All in all the color is great, the smell isn&#x27;t bad, it dries really fast, the color guide is really helpful, and it is an all-around great product! Perfect for those winter-pale legs now that spring is coming around.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Works great! And smells good too!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! The mit is fantastic. When I apply the tanner, I get an instant, beautiful colored tan. It is build-able. It will wash away after you wash your hands or take a shower, but your tan will still be there lightly. You can keep building it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a self tanner that had such dramatic results instantly. It is not orangey at all. Perfect dark tan. I am extremely sensitive to smells. I get a headache from scents and this stuff is borderline smelly. It has a very strong tropical odor but an underlying chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;I got a headache a couple times when&#x27; I&#x27;ve used it but overall it is totally worth it. It is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked the Fake Bake Flawless because it gives a beautiful, realistic tan glow. The application is pretty foolproof and the mitt allows for an even covering. I like applying it at night because if you get it wet at any point after you apply then you get color streaking. The initial application also sweats off after a workout. Overall I like this product except for the streaking and color rub-off afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years. Very easy to apply and pleasant smell.  The best part is that the product delivers a true &#x27;tan&#x27; color with no orange! And since it goes on dark there is no streaking. I love it and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it was a spray and not lotion.  But this stuff is awesome!  I love the applicator!  Great color.  I don&#x27;t think it last as long as I would like, but it is so easy to apply, I do not mind one bit!</li>
            <li> I have used A LOT of tanning products. I am naturally a very pale person. This goes on very easily and also not extremely dark. I personally like the gradual build up to a darker color. There is another person who wrote a review with excellent tips and tricks I recommend reading.</li>
            <li> Smells ok going on, still stinks like fake tanner (they all do no matter what people say, it is the chemical reaction that makes you brown!) Color is good, I found two days in a row and my white body was the best, three got a little blotchy around wrist and ankles no matter how good my application was. The mitt is great but you HAVE to wash it every time, I wash mine the next morning so I don&#x27;t mess up my newly applied tan :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blotchy. It makes my pores stand out. I put it on at night and shower in the morning and it all comes off. I tried it multiple days in a row and was never tan after the shower. my mitt started growing mold even though I took care of it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Fake Bake customer for years. There is no better sunless tanning system. The stuff just looks real. You won&#x27;t feel the need to get a tan anymore. The Flawless is my second favorite product of their line. It works wonderfully. I also use the aerosol mousse. The mousse is more of a quick, on-the-go product. It develops quicker, but tends to wash off sooner. Flawless is the opposite. It develops more slowly, but tends to stay on longer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on long great color easy to apply would buy it again good price good price good mitt love it</li>
            <li> I have tried them all....very pale, do not tan.  I used to get airbrushed...but found it looked like crap in about 3 days...this product is awesome, no streaks, looks great right away.  I will never be without it!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely perfect. Makes everything else look like &amp;#34;child&#x27;s play&amp;#34;! I have very pale skin \, w/red under tone, I&#x27;ve always ended up looking &amp;#34; orangey, fakeed&amp;#34;. With Fake Bake it just looks natural, follow directions about using oil on elbows etc. that&#x27;s it, so easy, so beautiful! Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tanners over the years.  Everyone still remembers that embarrassing day from back in high school when I showed up to school looking like an oompa loompa.  Fake Bake is, by far, the best.  I used to get the regular formula from a local hairdresser, but she moved away so I haven&#x27;t gotten it in a few years.  Last week I was looking at myself and thinking I&#x27;m too freakin&#x27; pale, so I decided to peruse Amazon for some Fake Bake and I found this.  It got good reviews, so I ordered it.  I tried it out yesterday for the first time, and the results are great.  It was easy to apply, and the color guide shows you exactly where the product is so you can avoid streaks.  The scent is awesome.  All self tanners have the same underlying smell from the active ingredient, but this one is very minimal, and the scent itself is great.  I would wear the scent alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically, I&#x27;ve had great luck with Fake Bake products in the past, and I don&#x27;t think think one is any different.  If my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing.  Have a backup pair of latex gloves.  The ones that came with it ripped on second use, but that&#x27;s no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I still do really like this product, but I had to take a star away.  The tan does not last as long as it did with the regular Fake Bake lotion I used before, and when it wears away, it gets kind of blotchy looking.  Not too noticeable, but I noticed it on myself.  I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d have to reapply this at least every other day for it to stay fresh and nice looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners and this is by far the best one. To be honest I was nervous buying this product because all the other self tanners were in aerosol cans and I thought that this kind would get all streaky and blotchy. Nope, pretty awesome stuff. Smells good too. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly fair that when I roll up my pants in the sunlight, I pull a &#x27;Twilight&#x27;. (My stomach just blinds people.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using different tanning products for years, everything from L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (which I was vaguely favorable to), MysticTan, VersaSpa (good in a crunch, but not at the eleventh hour), and Jergens Natural Glow. I came across this product when searching for options knowing I have a wedding to attend. I am extremely tired of being ORANGE. Especially in the traditional places where the lotions sink in too much and create the ever lovely bread-crust effect on the edges of the palms, between the fingers, nail beds, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the feet! Or streaks for that matter! (UGH!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter my discovery of Fake Bake Flawless. I was a bit gun-shy, seeing as there were a few reviews moaning and groaning about trouble with the mitt and trouble with leaking from the bottle... but after reading one absolutely AMAZING review (Shout out to Glynis Ewing!!) I decided to He** with it... I&#x27;m buying it! Worst that can happen is another orange week right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well! I am here to say, that is SO NOT THE CASE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FEEL PRETTY!! OH SO PRETTY! hahaha No really though... Glynis is dead on when she recommends that you trim the tube, I measured it by sight looking at how much would need to come off just to screw the cap down tightly. You will know what we mean when you see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR YOUR GLOVES!! Don&#x27;t risk having too much on your hands because this is a fast drying product (and trust me, that&#x27;s a good thing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean your mitt! I do it every time, and it&#x27;s been used three times now to equal success each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slowly!! I tend to get a bit antsy and go too fast over my thighs, but that&#x27;s how you can miss a spot... luckily, touch-ups are not hard with this formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with your feet, do both at the same time. Work your way up from your ankles to your knees, make sure you are working the whole way around your calves and then thighs. I say this because my first time I didn&#x27;t do this as a total airhead and went up one leg, and then found myself leaning against the leg I had just done to do the other. Which was awkward. I did work around that, but still... not the brightest moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for ladies with busts that are larger... make sure when you do your chest area, you are careful to have a fan at the ready so that you can dry the area rather quickly. If you let them sit and sweat, you might get lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you take off your gloves... WASH THE MITT FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you may ask? Because you don&#x27;t want to wash off all the tanning lotion that you put on your hands, and then try and clean the glove. I did that one too. Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Glynis mentioned, using the blending balm is a must! I thought buying a second product sucked but I was not exceptionally in to the whole idea of lines or splotches. And it was worth it! The balm is like a wax, and you apply it after the tanner to blend the color, or before it to block it completely. It&#x27;s pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079M7VN6/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 &amp;lt;--- Link to the Blending Balm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be adding a picture to show exactly how awesome the final product of the lotion was for me on the first go, and I must say, I really am pleased! I love it! My family has a super high number of people with skin cancer throughout, and I am less and less charmed with the idea of being in a tanning bed three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/15/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Fake Bake Flawless intermittently for some time now and am still very pleased with it! A few things that I have noticed that are worth mentioning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When washing your mitt: I use a gentle shampoo to wash it out, and truly scrub it. I have been using a paraben-free shampoo that I didn&#x27;t likefor my hair and it has been great for truly rinsing out all of the tanner and letting the mitt return to original status. If you don&#x27;t get it all out, when you use it again it will leave little dark brown specs that are coming off the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I spray the the Fake Bake on the back of my hands, one or two spritzes on each hand, and then put a deep moisturizer on with it and rub it all in together. That along with the blending balm on my knuckles and side of my palms is really affective for getting the color to my hands without leaving odd markings or shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have the \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; version of this product too, and it&#x27;s a lotion. Have to admit... it&#x27;s really not that great. It&#x27;s not as potent as the Flawless, and the Fair is harder to have saturate the skin. It takes time let it set... and it&#x27;s easier to scrape part of the color off on something by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Invest in a good wand that can be used to reach your back if you aren&#x27;t yoga flexible. Mine has a pumice-like stone that is non-porous that I got at walmart... It&#x27;s specifically marketed for tanning but I loathe it honestly so I plan to replace it with one from Amazon. However, it&#x27;s useful for reaching the areas that are hard to reach by hand alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still 5 stars!! Love this product!!for my hair and it has been great for truly rinsing out all of the tanner and letting the mitt return to original status.

            <li> I have never found a fake tanner that works as well a this one!  Looks completely natural, dries super quick, not sticky at all!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; smell.  Other than that, I will definitely keep buying this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and it&#x27;s hard to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t look fake or one that takes 10 applications to work but fake bake works great.  The first application made my skin darker but natural looking.  The applicator works well and not much product is needed so it should last a few months.  I rarely post reviews but I was more than happy with this product and will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just regular store bought tanning lotions and I feel like it works about the same. I do love that it comes with the mitt to rub it in so you don&#x27;t have to get it on your hands. I enjoy using it for a little extra color.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but am wondering if I should have ordered a lotion&lt;br /&gt;which may be applied a little easier and more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is one of best in self tanners.  Easy to use and it smells just great.  Use all over with no irritation even on your face.</li>
            <li> Used to spending wayyy too much time in a tanning bed (lay down AND stand up in same session) to achieve a great tan. I have extremely fair skin, and knew the risk I was putting myself in. In getting ready for a friends wedding, I realized how pasty I was, and that I had absolutely no time to tan. Toom a chance with Fake-Bake, and was shocked at how well this product works!! I literally used this about 2 hours before the wedding, and looked tan and flawless. My bf, my coworkers, and my friends have all marveled at how naturally tan Fake-Bake made me! I will never ever visit a tanning bed again, and may have to start hoarding this stuff!!! Save your skin girls!! Use Fake Bake!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and love it, came back for more; I would highly recommend it, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> i like the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe it would be nice to have an extra cloth with it but workes well, wish it  had a  more golden golw.</li>
            <li> I like the color this gives me, but I had difficulty applying this. The brown glove they give you seems great at first, until you start noticing piece of it stuck to your body! I also find it&#x27;s hard to get a really even coverage with the glove. Some areas were darker then others. It was hard to apply to places like collarbone, knees, ankles, and generally anywhere that&#x27;s &amp;#34;bony&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find that it smelled or rubbed off on my clothes (as long as I let it dry completely before dressing), and I did really like the color that it gave me. I may try different application methods (if anyone has a suggestion, let me know!) because I like the product, but I just think the glove doesn&#x27;t work for me. I know they have lotions too, so I may try those!</li>
            <li> I love this product and they actually shipped it to me before it said it would be due!  The instant brown wears off a little in the shower but you still get a nice glow from the product!  Love it and the seller!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake Flawless before, but ordered it at amazon from this seller because it is so much cheaper compared to Ulta $25+.&lt;br /&gt;I live in FL, so try to stay tan year round, mostly the beach during the summer, but use this stuff during the winter to keep my color. Fake Bake Flawless is awesome, it doesn&#x27;t streak and lasts for several days if applied properly, I use it twice a week. I don&#x27;t use the spray top because it goes everywhere around in a fine mist, I noticed it on the bathroom floor later, so I just unscrew the top and dap on the mitt and apply in circular motion, works much better for me that way. Also, I&#x27;m sure mostly everyone knows this, but I learned this the hard way, is to use a scrub before the first application and apply a little bit of lotion on feet, knees and elbows to make the product go on smoothly to those areas.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product, want to also try the Fake Bake Mouse and see if it&#x27;s just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as seller goes, my order came in earlier than expected and everything is packaged well, no complaints at all. Will reorder :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried many spay self tanners and this is by far the best i have ever tried! Its so easy to use and the results are unbelievable people thought i just got a lot of sun and didn&#x27;t look orange at all! Also it didn&#x27;t leave any streaks! The only thing is I did not order the oil and my elbows are a little rough but not noticeable. Overall it was defiantly worth the money I spent for it!</li>
            <li> This product looks natural, and it is easy to do application, unlike most products that make your skin look orange.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning spray ever!</li>
            <li> I really love the Fake Bake Flawless. I&#x27;ve tried probably every drugstore brand self tanner on the market, and was never even close to being satisfied with any of them. This is very easy to apply, the color is a very natural golden color, so you won&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa, and there is no horrible after smell.  My only complaint is that it sticks to some of the pores on my legs. I guess its really my fault for having large pores, but still I took a star off my rating for that reason. I was very satisfied with this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was a tad afraid to try it, but it worked great! It did turn me really dark at first, but it was the guide color. When I showered in the morning, the guide color came off and it looked good. Was not orange at all. The only reason I don&#x27;t use it all the time is because it is a little more time consuming than just lotion and with a new infant around, my time is pretty used up! Awesome stuff!!! Great for instant color. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Color No streaking great buy for the money. I tan easy and I love that you can use this until the sun does the trick!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good product however, even following all the instructions prior applying it, it gets a little uneven and fake looking on your legs. Also, the smell is like any other self-tanner, strong and bothersome. I don&#x27;t change the &amp;#34;million dollar&amp;#34; self tanner.</li>
            <li> Favorite self tanner on the market!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about self tanners and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used after years of actual &amp;#34;fake baking&amp;#34; in tanning beds. I love this product. It&#x27;s the only self tanner that doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Not only does it not smell bad, it smells great! Very tropical. Super easy to use, I did my whole body in under like 8 minutes. Great color and very real looking. I will be using this instead of tanning in a bed.</li>
            <li> just got my self tanner today i did try a lil on my hand and so far i like it cant wait till i tan myself!!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of self tan products, but this is without a doubt the best!  I really like the application method.  No streaks, splotches, etc.  Doing a re-order today.  Not used it all yet, but don&#x27;t want to take a chance on being without.</li>
            <li> This is actually the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried for the price.  Follow other reviews, be sure to shower first and do application in the shower for clean up.  Goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t look really artificial.  Need to reapply every few days.</li>
            <li> By far the best self tanner on the market. Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t have that bad &amp;#34;fake tan smell.&amp;#34; I really love it! I have used many tanning sprays and lotions in the past, all of which left my streaked and orange. You can see this in action as you apply it, so no waiting on it to set to know where you messed up! I plan on taking this with me on my cruise and using it each morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Easy to use, you can see exactly where you are applying the product. Doesn&#x27;t streak, covers easily. This is the first product I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange. Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I would apply first thing in the morning and shower it off before bed or you will be washing your sheets. It doesnt stain and washes out easily though. It isnt orange and doesnt streak. Just exfoliate and moisturize before applying and your golden bronze! It has a malibu rum coconuty mild smell and about the time to wash it off about 6 hours there is a very light self tanner smell which you really have to smell for. But this stuff keeps me tan and out of the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> Very, very natural color.  The mitt is absolutely awesome and love being able to see exactly where I&#x27;m applying. So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Makes you tan! I like it a lot only problem for me is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like!</li>
            <li> This self tanner is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it 6 times so far and I love it! The tan is no too brown, and not too golden; it is a perfect golden color. I&#x27;m usually pale, but this self tanner has achieved a golden bronze tan that all of my friends compliment. Absolutely worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll buy this for the rest of my life! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Just follow the directions, it works great.</li>
            <li> I dig this!! Love love love! I&#x27;ve ised many self tanners and this one is great! Definitely put rubber gloves on before and I spray directly on the mitt. Make sure you trim the spray tube so it isn&#x27;t too long. My first one I didn&#x27;t trim and it resulted in it leaking around the edge... Hence the gloves. Gives great color and the smell is not too terribly strong but still not great. I put it on before bed and then shower it off in the morning. It gets on my sheets enough that I change them because of the smell and rub off! Never had streaks and I use it on my face and everything!</li>
            <li> Not so impressed, I was expecting so much better. The color is nice but that odor , like other self-tanners, lingers. That nice island vanilla scent other ppl comment on doesn&#x27;t exist. The application is quite a long process too using that mitt I tried not using the mitt and the tanner would not wash off my hands.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Seemed to make me darker the first time I used it than subsequent times but goes on without streaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bad at this sort of thing, and even I found this easy to use.  I&#x27;m also super pale and was happy this didn&#x27;t look unnatural or orange.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and easy.  looks fairly natural and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Going to buy again !!</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to apply but way too dark for my ivory skin.  Need to make this in different shades.</li>
            <li> One of the best fake tanners I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> the color is natural and it dries quickly</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I&#x27;ve already bought my 2nd bottle because I love it so much. I&#x27;ve always been fair skinned and burn quite easily but this stuff is a godsend. Everyone asks me where I went on vacation because I finally look tan! I agree with everyone else-- exfoliate well before you use. I personally have noticed that if I shave immediately before I put this stuff on that it sinks into my pores a little bit, so if I&#x27;m going to apply this stuff I shave a day or two in advance. Use a thick body butter on your ankles, wrists, elbows, knees- last time i put Fake Bake on I skipped that step and the backs of my ankles looked ridiculous :)</li>
            <li> As a naturally very pale person, I&#x27;m always looking for a good self tanner. Color is very natural and there is no unpleasant smell. I will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li> Love this product, doesnt leave streaks, smells great unlike other self tanners</li>
            <li> Instant tan. No smells lingering all day. Great color! So glad I found this !</li>
            <li> I am about as fair as they come. I am pale, almost sickly pale. Sometimes I get insecure about it, so I&#x27;ve tried a couple other tanning methods. I&#x27;ve tried the sun, but it seems like I either burn or nothing happens. I&#x27;ve done the mystic spray tan and hated it, it lasted a couple days and smelled rank, and I&#x27;ve done banana boat and jergens lotion. Both are streaky and I hated the results (or lack of) I gave up and tried this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a spray cap, lotion type cap, a mitt and a pair of gloves. The easiest way is to snip off about an inch off the bottom of the spray top and use that instead of the lotion cap to avoid mess. I spray onto my skin everywhere except my hands, feet, and face, I spray onto the mitt for those areas. My favorite part is you can see what areas you&#x27;ve tanned because it has color guard. I didn&#x27;t use lotion on my problem areas and I didn&#x27;t have any blotches at all. Make sure to exfoliate before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve now been using this for a couple weeks and I can give a more detailed review. The tan itself on me lasts about a week. I find my face and chest seems to fade much faster then other parts so I end up re-touching every 2-4 days. Remember, I do not use gradual tanner in between, just this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like this because when you apply it and if you accidentally find a blotch, you can still rub it out if you recently applied the tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on this stuff for over a month and I&#x27;m getting to the point where it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to keep it up. I apply it at night before bed, get up and go to work and come home and shower. Almost 50% of it washes down the drain. I put a sticker on my hip to monitor the tan and I&#x27;m already losing a s*** ton of color the next day of washing. To keep my color I&#x27;d literally have to be applying every day or every other day. It just washes off. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m scrubbing hard either, just a quick sponge off. You could see where I placed the sticker clear as day after I tanned but after showering you have to really look to see it. I am extremely disappointed because it looked like this was going to be a good product, but it does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the fake bake lotion and I plan to double team myself with this product and that one in hopes I&#x27;ll have a more stable tan but if not, I&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle and never buy it again. I just don&#x27;t understand how it can fade that much after one wash. They say the color running down the drain is only color guard, thats not true. It&#x27;s half of your skin tone. :/showering you have to really look to see it. I am extremely disappointed because it looked like this was going to be a good product, but it does not last.

            <li> So far I love this stuff. I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use a self tanner to try and be a little bit more healthy. I am fair skin but tan easily.  I also have red hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much my skin was going to like this product because I am fairly pale. I haven&#x27;t tanned in a long time and so my skin has literally no tan. I live in Texas and I know that I am going to be in the sun a lot during the summer so I wanted to give my skin a break from the tanning beds. I really do love this product. It smells good. It works good. the mitt is okay. It could be designed a little better but it is what it is and I am glad its included.  I wish I would have found this product sooner. I will be buying this for everyone and using it year round.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t return this item.  Didn&#x27;t even get out of the box to try.  Once I saw the small container of it, I didn&#x27;t want to be having to purchase more of it very often.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake tan is amazing just make sure you rub it in good or you will get an uneven tan but the tan comes out perfect color and last a few days.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product through my hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy, dries pretty quickly, and looks great.. NO orange.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine, its not too strong or too bad.&lt;br /&gt;If you go to bed after putting this on, expect some to come off on your sheets, but it comes out just fine after going through the wash cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this product works great for me - plus it actually smells good which is a first for a tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> The spray bottle can do quite a mess so get in the shower to apply. the brown sponge is useless. I use it mostly on my feet and hands were a cream sunless tanner is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Ok so I am very white I have Irish skin with lots of freckles I have never been able to tan and self tanners turn me orange, I used fake bake and have a nice golden tan after two uses. i feel healthy i dont look ghostly and sick anymore this product is great</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product. I recommend it to all of my friends. The color is wonderful, not orange at all, a dark brown tone like you&#x27;d want, and its instant! For the first time ever I was actually called tan. I was in love. Although the color is wonderful...it has some downsides. Now, I got this bottle 14 days ago, and it is already almost empty. The color fades off me quite quickly, id say within 2 or 3 days I&#x27;m not very dark anymore, and I can barely see tan lines.. especially on my legs and back, and face. Within a day my face is back to the normal tone, so I have to add more. I have very sensitive skin and this gives me no breakouts at all. But is DOES dye the hair follicles on my legs...if you were to pay close attention to them it looks like I have little tiny brown dots on them, almost like they&#x27;re dirty. Now maybe I just use too much, since I am VERY light skinned, it takes a whole lot (like 6 sprays on each leg directly onto the skin) to get me a tanned color. Keep in mind this tan lasts like 2 or 3 days (one for my face) then I am back to my normal color. I have no problems with it rubbing off on my clothing, shaving does take off some of the color, it goes on mostly even too. So overall I would give it a 3.5 stars..But since I love the color so much, 4 stars. I just hate having to spend almost 20$ for 2 weeks, maybe 2 1/2 weeks of good tan. But I guess thats the price you gotta pay! Maybe I&#x27;ll try mixing it with another self tanner, and it&#x27;ll last longer.(:</li>
            <li> Great product. Natural color,no streaking,or missed spots thanks to the color guide. This is the only self tan product or professional spray tan I&#x27;ve seen that looks so natural even around the feet and hands. Everyone at work is ordering this stuff now!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Its fast and easy and it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order my fourth bottle of Fake Bake tanning spray.  I love, love, love this product.  I love that I can get a great tan without all that annoying skin cancer risk.  It looks natural and lasts for a while.  I recommend you use the latex gloves under the mitt if you can.  Watch your joints because they can get too dark.  Great product, best fake tan spray/lotion/gel on the planet.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, it&#x27;s like wow my skin is now a nice tan. But I found it works horrible on your face and is does turn orange colored after a few days..</li>
            <li> This is the first time in a while that I&#x27;ve used a self tanning product. I&#x27;ve tried it once, and I had fairly good results. The color is definitely not orange, even in daylight. I&#x27;m not sure where people are getting those results from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When following the proven instructions to apply self tanner (Shower, Exfoliate, Moisturize) I found it to be quite a simple process that had good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also smells much better than most tanners when putting it on, at least at first. I did find the smell to linger about for a day or so even after my first morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the excess colour to wash off in the shower the first time after applying it, so that wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me. It did even out my color and I was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know if I can maintain applying it once a week, as I do have to go out of my way to do so. Maybe a gradual moisturizer would be better since I moisturize every night anyway.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on countless sunless tanning products over the years, and every penny was a complete waste. I&#x27;d always look orange, have streaks, and uneven coloring. I ordered Fake Bake Flawless after a friend of mine recommended it to someone on Facebook after the girl asked if anyone knew where to get a good spray tan that didn&#x27;t turn you orange. She said that she had been using it for years now and loves it. She always has such a beautiful and healthy looking glow to her skin, so I immediately did my investigating on Amazon. I was still very weary since it seems that no matter what I try, I can never get natural looking results. Well, low and behold....I have FOUND IT! I can&#x27;t even begin to express how much I love the way this product makes my skin look! You HAVE to make sure that you exfoliate first, and I also used a little bit of baby oil on the rougher areas before applying (ankles, knees, heels, and elbows).&lt;br /&gt;Now let me warn you, at first, you may start to see dark brown spots in areas that are a tad more callous than other areas. What I did, because I totally freaked out the first time I seen it, was apply some more baby oil to those areas and blended it with the rest of the surrounding skin. It may still look dark, but once you shower the next day or 6hrs later, it comes off and you look amazing! OH...and make sure to cut the tubing of the sprayer before putting it in the bottle. It is way too long and would&#x27;ve caused a mess if I hadn&#x27;t checked out the other reviews on here first, telling me to do so.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because we were going on a cruise and I needed a tan asap.  I was very happy with the results.  Just like other self tanners, you have to follow the directions or you may see some spots where there is more color deposited.  I had small issues around my ankles and knees but nothing that stopped me from showing off my new tan.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used way too many products and they look and smell awful.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not so bad and not as messy.&lt;br /&gt;The color is better than the orange look so many give you.</li>
            <li> Went on nice ... No orange skin.. Left my skin soft feeling and loved the color it gave me.. I will order it again</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it doesn&#x27;t really streak and gives a nice bronze color. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it caused my legs to break out, which many tanning lotions do to my legs. Also you have to use quite a bit and put it on fast, it settles quickly and you could get spots darker than others. It does give you a nice fake tan after a few days.</li>
            <li> A little about me, I am very white, and I mean WHITE. I don&#x27;t like to go tanning because of how bad it is for you and how expensive it can be. I researched this product along with a few others and I decided I wanted a self tanner that would be fast drying and smell good and this did it for me. It has a great deep dark color, it applies evenly depending on how well you exfoliate your skin etc.  the tan doesn&#x27;t last a super long time but it only takes me 5 minutes to apply it to my whole body evenly so I don&#x27;t mind that it fades quick. I love the mitt, however mine got linty, I cleaned it after every use so maybe that&#x27;s why? The smell is very tropical and smells like coconut rum to be honest in the bottle. However on the skin the smell isn&#x27;t very strong. In between uses I use a hemp seed self tanning lotion to keep my skin moisturized with some extra color. This helps tremendously. My best advice is to exfoliate and shave well then apply it after a shower when your skin is towel dry but still some what damp. I tried to apply this to my face but I don&#x27;t like how it makes my face look due to my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;A list of pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great color&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;List of Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The mitt gets linty&lt;br /&gt;The color can be blotchy if not applied evenly&lt;br /&gt;It fades a little unevenly</li>
            <li> I like the color it gives me and its really easy to apply...only problem is it only last for about 3 days at the most. It goes on smelling good but eventually turns into that nasty self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite fake tanner!</li>
            <li> Thought it was the best self tanner that i have ever used. Worked great, loooked very natural easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan and easy to apply.  The Mit is nice to use, but small pieces come off of it when you use it.  Overall the best tanner I have used and the smell is not as strong as others</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I decided to give this stuff a try and let me just say I am happy I did. The mit that comes with it helps give a streak free look. I also wanted to add that the color isn&#x27;t orange like most products, it gives you a perfectly brown, natural look. However, I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your face, hands, and feet because it&#x27;s a little hard to get in on evenly in those areas. If someone know a trick to that, then let me in on that because I&#x27;m fairly new at using self tanners.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and 57 and hav tried a variety of fake tans before. They never came out even or looked real.. I was careful putting this for the first time but it was so easy and looked sooo good! :))  the application method is the best one out there...my 31 yr old daughter used to go to a salon to get a fake spray tan  but now she uses this too and loves it. :))</li>
            <li> Prior to using the fake bake tanner, I have been using the jergens tanning lotion for about 4 years. I grew very impatient with jergens because it took way too long to build up any color and even the darkest formula didn&#x27;t really build up much color on my skin.&lt;br /&gt; First off I am Asian and I have a pretty pale complexion. This review is for all the Asians out there that are curious about this product and how the color comes off on our Asian skin tones. What I am most afraid of when trying new self tanners is that the color will come off orangey and streaky. Luckily this self tanner produced and very natural color on my skin, very close to a natural tan. Not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt; When applying this product, you have to make sure your spread it out immediately after you spray it cause it sets into the skin very quick. Also make sure to not spray too close to the skin as it will make it more difficult to spread and will leave a small dot stain on the skin. Also don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate and shave or wax your skin prior to applying the fake bake (very important for an even and long lasting tan).&lt;br /&gt; This product is also pretty long lasting usually lasts about a week so I only use this once a week at night (I only apply self tanner to my legs) and the best part, I only need to apply this once to achieve a nice dark tan. It absorbs and drys very quickly so I can hop into bed right after and wake up with a tan the next morning.</li>
            <li> Goes on great and dries so quick! It was exactly what I was wanting and I will def be buying more.</li>
            <li> I loved that the tan was even, streak free, easy to apply and smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;Only down side was it didn&#x27;t last long. I applied 3x a week to keep myself dark like I liked.&lt;br /&gt;I still give 5 stars because its hard to find a even streak free \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Easy to use! No orange color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item thinking it will be a lasting tan....well it only lasts like a day, you have to reapply it everyday if you want a lasting tan. Will not order again. I am looking for something that lasts more then a day. I gave it a 2 because the smell is actually pleasant unlike other spray tans.</li>
            <li> Works great, has a pleasant smell and you have instant color to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, brownish tan color&lt;br /&gt;Easy to tolerate tropical fragrance that is light&lt;br /&gt;Tan stayed a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy!&lt;br /&gt;Blue gloves &#x3D; definite line where the solution does not reach means you have an obvious faux tan line at your wrists&lt;br /&gt;Mitt &#x3D; messy and twists around my hand, even when in the glove&lt;br /&gt;Probably need to rinse out the mitt after each use - I did so it would work the best for future uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- this is awfully complicated even though the color is nice.  It&#x27;s also not very portable as you have the bottle, mitt and gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Tan Towels for over a year - they are individually wrapped towelettes and are disposable.  Super easy little pouches to travel with and produce a good color too.  MUCH easier to use than this Fake Bake situation.  I&#x27;m going back to the Tan Towels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Natural look and none of the funky smell.  Dries quickly and completely.  Beware heavy application on your face; that&#x27;s the one place where less is more.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing self tanner online for my daughters high school grad/prom.  I&#x27;ve seen some horrible orange blotchy tans and that was the last thing I wanted for her special day.  This product is exceptional.  Easy to apply, quick dry and a beautiful natural looking tan.  LOVE Fake Bake!</li>
            <li> it works great. it gives you a natural tan look.  I love it when I just want to look a little tanner before I go out. I also go tanning but when my package ends aand don&#x27;t really feel like buying a new one ill use this. I don&#x27;t know what my natural skin color is anymore so im not sure how this would look on white white people? but I did spray a spot on my boyfriend once and it made him tan in that one spot. (his legs are WHITE) so if your white and want use this id make sure you do a good job.. but that&#x27;s just my opinion. but if your medium tone like me it works get to get that extra tan!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self tanning products in the past and I can honestly say this one gives the most realistic color of all of them. Product was delivered as advertised. I did have to trim the squirt bottle stem because it was about an inch too long, but other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Tan is not orange at all.  It looks pretty natural and is extremely easy to apply. Best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This product is my pale easily burned miracle, I mean seriously this thing works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many various products while others streak and look orange, Fake Bake looks 100% natural with no spots or streaking.&lt;br /&gt;But FYI to avoid the streaking wash mit intermittenly. I now am confident to take on summer with any outfit (especially my bikini)!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning spray I have ever used! No streaks, not stinky smells! All over even color. People compliment on how pretty my complexion is!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to get a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my 2nd purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Read the review by Glynis Ewing for a comprehensive review.  My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Put a towel down as your floors will be covered with a brown layer if you do not.&lt;br /&gt;2. I spray directly onto my skin and smooth in with the mitt for perfect coverage.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell is light and pleasant, almost like a soft coconut oil, definitely NOT strong or overpowering like most products.&lt;br /&gt;4. The tan lasts for days and looks totally natural.&lt;br /&gt;5. Allow overnight for your tan to appear, it will get darker, be patient!&lt;br /&gt;6. If you will be sweating, rinse before you go out as the temporary color will come off onto your clothes a bit, this does not happen after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Every one on youtube was raving about this product saying how good it was so I decided to try it out. I applied it as directed and I didn&#x27;t get any darker. (Mind you I&#x27;m super pale). This did absolutely nothing. The only thing good about it is that it smells good. Other than that it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for fake bake flawless after reading countless reviews. I decided to order it to try it out. I have very light pale skin naturally with cool undertones. Pros: Easy to apply, smells nice, came quickly, gave nice natural color. Cons: DOesn&#x27;t last very long i used a quarter of the bottle with two applications, took two applications to get a good color, very dark color gaurd I couldn&#x27;t go outside with it on in public without loooking very strange. Overall its a good product but I will only purchase again if I find it at a very good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic if you want an instant tan then you have to buy this and once you do you&#x27;ll never stop I promise</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of self tanning products.I am extremely fair skinned darn right glow in the dark.This product is just what it says.Easy to use and what a beautiful result.It gives just the right shade.The price is great especially for the amount of product you get.I will definitely be back for more.Shipping was right on schedule.If your not sure or are UN happy with other self banners Then give this a try.Great Product.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and with summer right around the corner I wanted to try something to give me a little color. I absolutely love fake n bake its super easy to use and the color looks great</li>
            <li> It works well but make sure you have a day or so before going in public.  allow at least two showers to wash off the excess product.</li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS. When you first put it on it smells good then the next day you reak of sunless tanner smell even after showering. They need to add an elastic to the bottom of the mitt so it stays on your hand. I personally feel the color appears a bit orange and I&#x27;m not super white.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts, is easy to apply (you can see where its going so no mistakes) and no funky smell. I apply it after I moisturize and it works great, love that it comes with a mitt, so no residue is left on my hands.  Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Despite what one reviewer here said: cutting the spray tip down did NOT reduce the leaking- and boy was it a mess. I remedied this by transferring to another container otherwise this would be going back. Still not sure of the results but the delivery was enough for me to reconsider this purchase. What some women will do for a tan. Fake Bake get your packaging right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update with overall body review: Okay- so I stripped down with my new container (which did not leak from the top). I cannot recommend this product based on how difficult application was. First of all, it is a spray need I say more. Second of all- the applicator that came with pilled and fell off on my bathroom floor during the first application- it&#x27;s in the trash now. Thirdly- even with the replaced bottle and pretty wide mitt- I still got overspray on my wall and floor-luckily all came up. Lastly: after the other night i sprayed only my legs: most of it washed off the next day and I had a spot on the sheets (did I spit or sweat?) that did NOT come out.&lt;br /&gt;So no matter the color result, the \\&quot;getting there&#x27; just too painful.</li>
            <li> WOW, I am impressed. I am pale white Irish chick. I put this on and yes, compared to a normal person I am still white but I could tell there was a good amount of color. I was able to apply more and build to an actual tan color.  I used 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 coconut oil with a splash of vanilla to exfoliate int eh shower before applying. I smelled wonderful, I was soft and I looked tan! And for the price- I am blown away.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely blown away by this product and could not believe the amazing results! For years I tanned in my tanning bed but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve been concerned about the effects on my skin.  This product delivered the same results I used to get with my tanning bed in just minutes!  No more \\&quot;orange\\&quot; knees and elbows and the fragrance is great!  If you are wondering if this product does what it says, I can tell you that it absolutely does 100%!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake works well and gives you a nice, healthy tan.  It does occasionally come out splotchy, which you can really see when you go outside.  It does wash off some in the water (bath or swimming).  I put this on for a BBQ/pool party.  I was not going swimming but I got splashed by people jumping in the pool and it made very noticable lines down my legs.  I&#x27;m glad it was my family I was around because I would&#x27;ve been even more embarrassed if I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Turns you tan in minutes!! Awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply &amp; you won&#x27;t look orange after :) if you hate waiting days or weeks to get tanned, then this is the product to get as a self tanner.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanner I have ever used, and really, I think I tried all of them.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use,tans evenly,great smell and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is looking for self tanner look no further. This is great stuff. Makes your skin look like you&#x27;ve been to the bed many times. The MIT is easy to use and makes it look very even. You will never get it on your hands and can rub gently on top of hands. Amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to sunless tanner! For the first time in my life, I wasn&#x27;t orange. I have fair/light skin and I&#x27;ve battled with the orange thing my whole life. It&#x27;s almost a sigh of relief to use something (that is super easy to apply) and be happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner for years and although you seem to have to re apply it daily it works great!</li>
            <li> Oh my, I am such a fan of this!  Let me start by explaining who I am.  I am a mother of two, full of figure and white as a sheet.  I have purchased many different self tan products, and this by far is the BEST I have ever purchased.  It truly doesn&#x27;t not give an ugly orange color...or streak!  (Well, once I figured out which side of the mitt to use, it was flawless. Ha.)  I am 5&#x27;7&#x27;&#x27;ish and a full 185 pounds.  I have now used the product three times over my entire body...and I still have a few more applications to go!  It is well worth the money, and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I use the magic-in-a-spray-bottle, I did a few things to prepare.  I shaved (ugh) and exfoliated my legs, arms and chest.  I also put some vitamin E oil on my wrists, elbows, knees and ankles.  I worked my magic, and had The Hubbs help get the hard to reach areas (heehee.)  It dries almost instantly, so there&#x27;s no need to run around naked for hours around your house.  Unless you want to, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I see with this product, Is that my tan fades within a few days....and the pores on my face and chest are very dark the first day or so after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this albino Momma is a HUGE fan of this product and will definitely continue to purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff! This has replaced my St. Tropez........i just purchased my second bottle! I wish I new about this product long time ago.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t quite last the full week. Closer to 3 days. But still looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanner! DO NOT USE ON YOUR FACE IF YOU HAVE ANY BLEMISHES! The product will settle in the blemish and make it look like a black dot. You need to exfoliate and shave before using on body. If used correctly you&#x27;ll have a pretty beautiful dark tan!</li>
            <li> Guys, I seriously LOVE this product. I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl who can tan; but chooses not to. I recommend this to all my friends who are wasting their time building a harmful tan only to hit their mediocre peak color in hot, stinky, occasionally not thoroughly cleaned, tanning beds. I get darker than them in 2 applications from this &amp; they get jealous!! At first I was hesitant because ive tried &amp; failed with tons of drugstore brands, expensive home airbrush, mousse, lotions &amp; towelettes, all because I hate tanning beds! It dries super quick, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong, feels light on your body, and the color guide is awesome! It&#x27;s really hard to mess this one up, especially with the mit. Exfoliate, use barrier cream on your rough spots, apply in natural light and leave on as long as you can before rinsing &amp; I promise you&#x27;ll be satisfied!</li>
            <li> The actual product was good, it gave an even natural colour.  However, the micro fibre mitt is too short and tends to come off the hand when applying. In my case the actual dispenser leaked when spraying hence there was always quite a mess everywhere so on that basis I rate this product as a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase is again?  Yes, maybe.  Would I recommend it? probably.</li>
            <li> The product itself is excellent and my favorite self tanner. BUT let me just warn you, that I packed a full bottle into my luggage when going on vacay, In a sealed ziplock bag to prevent spilling, and when I got to the hotel I realized that somehow the liquid came out of the bottle &amp; the brown liquid seeped through the bag and completely ruined over $250 worth of clothing &amp; almost half the bottle was gone. On the way home from my vacation I made sure to tighten the lid (like I did the first time) and use 2 ziplock bags &amp; an additional plastic bag over the two ziplock, but yet somehow it leaked again, but I placed the bottle away from clothing, but if I wouldn&#x27;t have done that I would&#x27;ve ruined more clothes. Bottom line DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THIS ITEM WHEN FLYING.. Unless the bottle is completely unopened.</li>
            <li> As an avid tanner, I&#x27;ve tried everything from tanning booths to spray tans to self tanners. Foams, sprays, lotions, anything you can think of. This might be my favorite find yet though; the mit makes for a SUPER fast application (just did a full body app in under 5min) and the toner helps to guide the way so you can see what you&#x27;re doing. I come out looking brown, not orange, and this is the first self tanner EVER that doesn&#x27;t smell disgusting, or sparkle. Like all of the other reviews, I have to give this 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I am not a pro at this but this product seems to be good. The color it gives you is not yellow and the smell is not too overpowering. 4 stars because the color doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I had to go back and use this item again to like it. It goes on dark and is a good color.  Washes off some in shower but that is nomall. Gives me a good fan. I am very light skin. Only reason I gxve it four stars is because it had that tanning smell which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I am on my third order...I now order two bottles at once I love it sooo much. I have never used a mitt before to apply a self tanner so I was a little nervous about the first application..but it is virtually idiotproof...you really cant screw up the application unless you just dont wipe that spot...to all of you reading through reviews trying to figure iut which tanner to order just like I did..get this product you will be happy with your results!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this much better than the chemical smell of most self-tanners. The mitt works fine, and I wash it out thoroughly in between uses. My only problem is a learning curve of getting an even look on my feet. I use lotion on the sides and heels before applying, but it still looks unnatural. I think I will try some petroleum jelly as some others have suggested. Overall very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ab-soooooo-lutely amazing! I am white, very white and this works so great and doesn&#x27;t look orange at all (unless you don&#x27;t apply it as directed). I didn&#x27;t want anything that made me look super dark. Just a little tan glow so i don&#x27;t blind people with my white legs. If you build this up it can get very dark but i like to for subtle. Its a great product and beleive me i have tried most of them!</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t streak!!!</li>
            <li> The best on the market....people are surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s an artificial tan!</li>
            <li> Love this! gives me a perfect and fast glow every time! and has lasted me months</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Looks great and dries really fast (within seconds) which is a major plus. Doesnt make you feel all icky like other self tanners</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this... the color was great and natural looking, but I followed the directions exactly (even left extra drying time) and put it on at night, as directed. I RUINED MY FAVORITE SHEETS! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It also didn&#x27;t tan my face, I suspect it&#x27;s because I exfoliate it frequently. Going back to St. Tropez. :(</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No streaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to exfoliate before using this. It does &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; in pores if you don&#x27;t exfoliate properly. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on the sheets. Overall great product</li>
            <li> Very good color . I tried many self tan brands . And this was the BEST</li>
            <li> This product was okay. I used it and it will definitely highlight and darken any skin imperfections. For example, if you haven&#x27;t just shaved your legs, the color will darken in the hair pores.  Other than that the color was alright.  I know that some people use this on their face but if you are like me and have bad skin, it is the worst thing you could put on it.</li>
            <li> I am borderline addicted to this stuff. It&#x27;s the next best thing to an airbrush tan that I have found, and much more friendly on the wallet. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Since my days of working in tanning salons are over, I&#x27;ve tried every sunless tanner out there. This is by far my favorite!!.. I just wish you can purchase extra tanning mitts!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Fake Bake.  Color goes on smooth and looks &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t live near the beach and I&#x27;ve given up on tanning beds.  This product goes on easy, and increases with daily use ( but not to a ridiculous color).  No strong smell either</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND EXCELLENT SELLER!</li>
            <li> BEST fake tanner around. The mitt applications makes for the even smooth coverage. This will NOT make you look orange!!! I get compliments on my tan ALL the time. I stay out of tanning beds and sun - I owe it all to fake bake!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product ever! I use it all summer long and I&#x27;m a normally pale lady. With this stuff I get comments on how tan I look all the time.,Such a nice thing to hear when before I felt embarrassed of my white legs.</li>
            <li> A lovely natural looking tan, stays on nicely, super easy application.</li>
            <li> Must put on at night! If not completely dry it will rub off on clothes or streak in the rain! Learned my lesson the hard way.</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> im almost done with my first bottle of this and i love it. no need for a gradual tan unless you wana be super dark, one coat is good enough. only thing i can complain about it is the mitt started to wear away after about 10 uses. maybe i rub too hard? but once the mitt started going, it made the tan un even</li>
            <li> I really love this self tanner. I have been spray tanning (by professional) for over 8 years and costs about $50 each time! So I wanted to try a spray I can do myself. This works wonderfully! It&#x27;s the next best thing to my professional spay sessions. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Love love love!</li>
            <li> This gives a really natural and buildable bronze color and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  I&#x27;m a klutz but was able to avoid streaking. It even works on my face.</li>
            <li> This is so great! I usually stay away from tanning applicators or crazy &amp;#34;mitts&amp;#34; but I gave this a try because of the reviews and what a pleasant surprise! This product goes on so evenly and smooth, you don&#x27;t have to keep washing your hands in fear of staining them. It dries quickly and very little smell and the color is beautiful. Not even that expensive and worth every penny. Trust me, this is a great tanner.</li>
            <li> I have tried about a jillion different self tanners. L&#x27;oreal, St. Tropez, Neutrogena, gradual lotions, wipes, sprays - you name it. This stuff is by far the best! The spray is tinted so you can se where you are applying it and it gives you a nice chocolate glow rather than the type of glow that can skew orangey. It smells marvelous, none of that self tanner smell here. The glove is part of what makes this so marvelous, it helps you get an even spread. And a bottle seems to last a long, long time, unlike the lotions, which I chug through in 2 weeks and the sprays which last a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snipped the extra length off of the spray hose, like one reviewer suggested, and I haven&#x27;t had any leak problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - if you like a nice fake glow, this is it.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have said, \\&quot;i&#x27;ve tried them all!\\&quot;  By \\&quot;all\\&quot; I mean all the ones that you can buy at your local drug store.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay upwards of $50 for some of the ones you might find at a cosmetics counter that get fantastic reviews.  I wanted to try something middle of the road that was a decent price and might have better results than what I was used to.  This product pleased on all levels.  The color is really great.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from friends who said they were jealous of my tan and had no idea it wasn&#x27;t real.  I&#x27;m quite fair skinned and this gives me a better looking tan than the one I had 10 years ago when I faithfully went to a tanning bed all summer, and that&#x27;s after just one application.  It&#x27;s great that it comes with a tanning mit.  i have always used a mit when self tanning and i&#x27;ve found it crutial to getting the color even and keeping your palms from getting tanned.  At first I was wary of the pump spray bottle but it works well.  This bottle will last me a long time I can tell.  The tinted tan guide is helpful and doesn&#x27;t look horrendous or like a shimmery bronzer.  if you had to put this on and then go somewhere it would look ok.  Also it dries so fast because it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br /&gt;One of my absolute favourite things is that it doesn&#x27;t smell AT ALL.  I have never tried a tanner that didn&#x27;t immediately give off that metallic funk that hung around you until you showered later, even if they promised they were odor free.  I&#x27;m amazed it doesn&#x27;t smell.  YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;ll be sticking with Fake Bake for the long term.  I look forward to showing off my tan this summer.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks just tan enough, not super dark and definitely not orange. I was worried about the scent but it has a very light tropical scent.</li>
            <li> Best tanner I&#x27;ve used in 20 years of trying tanner products!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing color.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t stain or get me blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Tan is natural to my color - looks real.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t stink!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on - tanned me in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing better I&#x27;ve found from this... forget paying $50 for spray tan salons ... this stuff worked perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy with this stuff - I will be buying this as my main tanner from now on!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing. So easy to apply! Dries fast, smells nice. I bought the kit which included the body polish and the skin smoothie. Love it all. I was skeptical about using a mit but it was so easy and looks so good. From other reviews I learned to cut the spray straw before using because it is too long for the bottle. And definitely wash the mit after applying your tanner.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl who researches a product in-depth prior to purchasing and I pay special attention to negative reviews. While researching Fake Bake Flawless, I noticed that most of the negative reviews were from fair-skinned women like myself. Well, I am very, very fair-skinned, so I ordered this product with a bit of hesitation. I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I would first tan only my legs, in case it became streaky or orange on my white skin with red undertones. If it turned out badly, I could always wear pants until it faded. Well, I exfoliated like crazy, paying attention to my knees and ankles. After I exited the shower and dried off completely, I added a dab of baby oil gel to my knees to lessen the amount of self-tanner that was deposited there. I then applied the self-tanner per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed color right away, but since many pale reviewers claim that ALL of the color washed away after their shower the next morning, I did a second very thin layer after the first layer dried, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the tanner on for 9 hours and then rinsed it off, using my hands---NOT a loofah or wash cloth. Once the water ran clear, I exited the shower and used a towel to pat-dry my legs. Next, it was the moment of truth. I examined my former milky white legs and couldn&#x27;t help but stare with a cheesy grin on my face. I was amazed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My once pale legs are now a sun-kissed brown with absolutely no streaks. I seriously cannot stop staring at them and I can&#x27;t wait to tan the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product for all complexions. I also advise everyone to read as many tips as possible on application, trim the stem of the spray-bottle head about 1 1/2 inches prior to use to avoid leakage (it is way too long for the bottle), and wash the mitt after every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pay very close attention to what you&#x27;re doing and exfoliate beforehand, add a dab of oil to knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly, let it sit for at LEAST 6 hours, and use your hands to rinse, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake Flawless is now my favorite product.o knees, ankles, and elbows, buff lightly, let it sit for at LEAST 6 hours, and use your hands to rinse, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Bake Flawless is now my favorite product.</li>
            <li> Well, the best thing I can say about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent. Smells are a big thing to me. I have used lots of self tanners and this one is okay. It does dry quickly but it also goes on with a red tone which is quite surprising. The red calms down and the end result color was fine. I need to apply it daily so the tan can build but one application doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I have had a couple of skin cancers so I make a huge effort to stay out of the sun. Pale skin doesn&#x27;t really bother me but I just need to get that death glow off my legs when I first wear skirts without stockings in the spring. I say that to point out I don&#x27;t need a dark tan, I&#x27;ve never done the tanning bed or anything like that and this doesn&#x27;t stick around. Also, the warning about it coloring your hands, oh boy take that one seriously! I have gotten away with just washing my hands with other self tanners but the one time I tried it without the glove I had to get out the scrub brush, won&#x27;t make that mistake again. Over all, I say skip it and buy something cheaper at the drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I have ever used.  It goes on smoothly with the glove, and the color developes quickly and evenly.  I am very fair skinned and have a difficult time finding a self-tanner than doesn&#x27;t look orangy and rusty.  This product is wonderful. It does have the usual odor of most products of this type, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> okay , i first got this as a gift a few months ago &amp; immediately got more .&lt;br /&gt;it really is streak free &amp; smells way better than other self tanners . you get color almost immediately &amp; full color in about 6 hours . there&#x27;s only two things i don&#x27;t like about it , one - is that the glove they give you to apply it with gets wicked grimey after one use , &amp; even after washing it out , it had like a weird rough texture . i&#x27;m not sure where you can get more . &amp; two - i LOVE the color it gives me right after applying &amp; waiting the 6 hours till it sets , but once you take a shower , even if it is the next day , you loose a lot of color .&lt;br /&gt;the box says to apply once a week , i use it every other day along with salon tanning . but i like to be dark , so i guess it&#x27;s really about how dark you want to be . i&#x27;m more of an olive tone , my friend is really pale , she uses it once a day , &amp; doesn&#x27;t tan in salons .&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve got my mother in law &amp; all my girls in love with this stuff , it really is a quick easy way to get quick color , not a nasty orange color either , a nice deep tan .</li>
            <li> I just got my fake bake flawless today. To start off, I got two instead of one. Not sure if it was supposed to come with two and I just wasn&#x27;t aware. Anyway, I have very pale, and somewhat freckly skin. This product is all around amazing for me. I could never find a self-tanner that didn&#x27;t turn me orange. I was also too nervous to ever get a spray tan. I can say that this product (after one use) does not turn me orange. The only thing I can say is that if you wait too long after you spray it, it is much harder to spread around evenly. However, it is extremely easy to use if you&#x27;re careful. I am so so happy with this product and will use it forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weeks of use, the only flaws I noticed were:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sweating will take the self tanner off, or make it blotchy or uneven.&lt;br /&gt;2. Getting your skin wet in any other way (especially pools) will take it right off and make light spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this really disappointed me, I still love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> So glad I Purchased This. Works Amazing, No Streaks Or Blotches, And None Of That Orange Nonsense. Just Remember To Wash Your Mit.</li>
            <li> The title says it all: this is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It smells good but not strong, isn&#x27;t streaky, and produces a beautiful, natural tan color--no orange!  It also has a tint to it, so you can see where you&#x27;re applying it.  The instructions are very thorough and if you follow them, you will have a great color right away that lasts for a few days.  The price is comparable to a drugstore self-tanner, but the quality is that of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The only slight issue I have is the microfiber mitt starts to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; (like a sweatshirt), even though I wash it between uses, but I would be happy to purchase more mitts in order to keep my tan going.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get better than this! Why go to a bed and get CANCER when you can spray this and it looks exactly like same! Its a god sent !</li>
            <li> Amazing!! This smells great, streak free and not orange at all. I even use it on my face. I use it about 2 days in a row in a week. It does not give me that super dark look but a very natural tan look which is what I wanted. Enough to look a little tan and not pasty white but not enough that people think....&amp;#34;hmmm&amp;#34;. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best self tanner I have ever tried, and I normally dont like them. I bought fake bake for face, and it worked so well, I decided to get it for the body too. It takes a lot of work to apply it, but for me so does driving 30 minutes to the tanning bed. I still tan at the tanning, but I am using this in conjunction with the bed because I live so far and it looks natural. I like the mitt, but this spray version is a little hard to rub in for me. because I am already so tan, it makes it a little difficult to see where I am putting it. I do not rinse it off after 60 minutes, again because I am so tan already. I just leave it on until I shower and it&#x27;s fine. I dont know how dark this would be on super pake skin, but I would for sure stick to 60 minutes at first. Works!</li>
            <li> Was shipped on time and was nicely packaged. I am giving the product alone a 1 star. How the heck do people give this a 5 star? I put a layer on and thought maybe I will like this, but after a full day I just went back to my natural skin tone, which is disapointing. I did put another layer on but that didn&#x27;t make a difference. Id rather spend more money on a fake tan that lasts.</li>
            <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> I swear by this self tanner now! I put it on twice a week and love the results. The bottle lasts at least a month, if not two, by using it twice per week. I tried it on my husband before a tropical vacation and even he liked it.</li>
            <li> Easy deep dark long lasting tan with out the Sun!</li>
            <li> Best fake tanner I have ever used, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of self tanners I&#x27;m a red head so self tanning is a necessary evil for me. This product is comparable to Clarins body bronzer, but alot less expensive.  It has a dark color guard it is messy and you spray it and rub the product into your skin. (it will drip everywhere)  I didn&#x27;t use the mitt it comes with I feel like those things only absorb the product and you end up using more, but anyways. You&#x27;ll need rubber gloves to apply it to keep it off your hands.  The color pay off is good with this one, just make sure you moisturize after it develops because it really drys out your skin.  One application gives you a nice color also make sure you don&#x27;t sweat or go out in the rain after you use it that color guard is messy and will get everywhere.  I&#x27;ll probably keep a bottle of this on hand from now on as my backup product.  Happy Tanning!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she uses it quite often. It blends in nicely and looks very natural. It has a strong sweet smell which may turn some off but compared to the horrible smell of other tanning sprays it is welcome.</li>
            <li> Wife writing this review:  works well if you follow the directions and don&#x27;t overdo it.  I am fair skinned (one step up from a red head, basically) and this works pretty well, better than I thought it would.  It didn&#x27;t end up looking too bronze, either, which I appreciated.  I used a light coating of massage oil on my hands, elbows, and knees prior to applying.  The mitt worked well.  My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a little messy, make sure and do it somewhere that you can clean up later (I did mine at the bathroom counter/sink and all the brown spray cleaned right off later).  The instructions say to apply before bed, but I would advise against that if you sweat at night, I ended up sweating in my sleep and had my arm folded and had a very noticeable brown line down my arm the next day.  Other than those avoidable/fixable problems, overall a good product and would recommend.  Plus the smell is better than any other tanning product I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me.It gives a very natural tan without any orange streaks.</li>
            <li> does anyone know if this canbe use for the face as well</li>
            <li> Winner!  on my second bottle and I love this.  Sometimes my skin looks a little dry but overall it is a great product.  No smell, dries quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter, she said she liked it a lot and it worked well for her. She stated that it is not her favorite bend though.</li>
            <li> I do not understand the positive reviews. It is not golden, it is not tan, it is dirty brown. The worst color I have even seen in a self tanner</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical purchasing this, mainly because most of these fake tan products leave me orange or I can&#x27;t rub them in without leaving streaks. But I&#x27;m amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not heavy or stinky. It was quick to apply, I&#x27;m not orange and I haven&#x27;t found a streak. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. I wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the color after showering/getting rid of tester. I still have not perfected the application process. Despite exfoliating, it was easy to over blend and cause the tanner to ball up on my skin. It does dry very quickly and there were areas that looked blended but after an hour or two, ended up looking much lighter. I have used this three times so far but am still getting the hang of the application.</li>
            <li> I have better results with Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion - Deep Dark.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve never used a self-tanner before, but this has to be the easiest, most fool-proof product to use, and it works fast!  In just two days I&#x27;ve gone from pasty white to a respectable (i.e., not a vampire) color, and there&#x27;s been no streaking or uneveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip:  if you put it on at night before bed, it&#x27;s a good idea to have dark-colored bedsheets, or else you&#x27;re going to have some staining on your sheets by morning.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a quick Homecoming tan!</li>
            <li> I have used both the lotion and spray versions of this product and I like the spray but the lotion works much better. You get a richer looking color with the lotion. The spray is great if you do not want a dramatic change over night but it did take longer to accomplish the tone I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great.  And doesn&#x27;t have the tanning smell to it.  It doesn&#x27;t last quite as long. I usually wash the applicator mit in the dishwasher and it comes out new again.</li>
            <li> After using Fake Bake, I won&#x27;t ever use another sunless tanning product, and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!  I love the color and the fact that you can rub it in seamlessly with the mitt that comes with it. The color comes out evenly and natural lookig, and after one application when I wake up the next day, I feel so much more attractive. I even use this on my face and rub it in with my hands, and then scrub my hands with a nail brush right away to keep the developer from turning my palms orange. This makes your skin look so much more even. I don&#x27;t even feel the need to put on foundation when I&#x27;m tanned with Fake Bake</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the fake bake products as I have been a long time fan since I found they gave me the least orange look. This version is the best I have seen yet. The provided glove makes the application so much faster and even. With the guide this is the fastest self tanner I have found that provides a very even look.</li>
            <li> Works well. Hard to mess it up. No funky smell. Stained a bathroom rug but has come out of all other fabrics. Biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long so I find myself reapplying daily but that&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world. I have already reordered once. You do need to wash out your mitt or it can mold.</li>
            <li> i really like this self tanner. its not crazy dark but it gives me a nice color.its not orangey looking and it doesnt smell bad either.it doesnt streak which i really like because i use it on my legs all the time. ive had a lot of problems with tan sprays before because the nozzles are always broken before i even use them or they splat all over the place but not with this product it sprays onto the mitt evenly and the nozzle never stopped working.i already bought my second bottle.best product ive tried so far.</li>
            <li> I am pretty dark already, but have psoriasis. I use light therapy for it but it still leaves me with spots.&lt;br /&gt;This product was great to help my spots blend in. Natural looking color and the best part it didnt make my psoriasis worse. I can be really sensitive to alot of products.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I think it&#x27;s best self tanner I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Ok just applied tonight. My bottle dripped also, like other reviews said. I am going to pour the solution into another spray bottle that I have. That was annoying having drips everywhere. I think Fake Bake needs to fix that mess. I had showered and exfoliated. I sprayed the solution on to my handy dandy mitt. It was actually pretty easy. After I finished, I put a little lotion on my hands and feet. I am afraid they will be too dark...always a problem for me with sunless tanner. It dried pretty quickly. So I am going to bed and will see what tomorrow brings. I will update in a week.</li>
            <li> This may be called fake bake, but the color it leaves is beautiful and looks like a real tan. Like other reviewers, my pale, freckly, self has tried and been disappointed with many other self tanners out there. I started using the St. Tropez mousse and loved it, but decided to give this stuff a try after my bottle ran out. If you&#x27;re debating between the two brands, I definitely recommend giving this a try. The instant color it provides is a great application guide, and the smell is the best of any self tanner I&#x27;ve used - light, tropical, almost coconut scented. The bronzer washes off in the shower and you&#x27;re left with nice, natural-looking color. If you want a little darker color, just use more sprays. Definitely go easy around the usual trouble spots (elbows, knees, etc) though, and exfoliate beforehand to prevent any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe about this product is actually a good thing, and that&#x27;s that it dries fast. Great as far as not staining clothes, but a little tricky when you&#x27;re new to applying. This is a fantastic self tanner though, and a must have for us pale girls wanting some safe color!</li>
            <li> Very nice color, easy to use, works quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, I will never go to a tanning salon again unless they stop making it! It goes on so easily and quick with the mitt being so big, and you can see it go on so you don&#x27;t have to wait and see if you did it right a few hours later.  Love the smell and the results are so natural looking.  I can&#x27;t believe  I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner.  Oh and seller was great also, received my package in like 2 days.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply.  It gets darker within about 24 hours, and stays on for a few days.  I have olive skin and this looks great on me. I think I&#x27;ll go back to the spray ones though since that allows me to spray my back, and this doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as pale as they make them and I usually burn in the sun. I never tan or go to a tanning salons. With this stuff I bronze like I&#x27;ve actually tanned. I bought this based on reviews and I&#x27;m pleased to say this stuff is awesome! You&#x27;re able to control the amount of tan you want on you. At first it looked kind of strange but after using the mitt to rub around, it came out nice. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it dries quickly. It definitely leaves a nice glow. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would think it would. I&#x27;m lucky if I&#x27;m tan for 5 days. If you have time to apply it every 3-4 days, you&#x27;ll look amazing all the time!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is pale. hardly no color!! I don&#x27;t get so many positive reviews?? she exfoliates and has tried several times to see barely any difference!  back to spray tanning at the tanning place</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this product. It is so easy to use (i&#x27;ve never had problems yet with any of the pumps), I have never had any streaking/lines and never have turned orange from it either. Make sure that you shower, don&#x27;t take a bath after set hours after becuase you will rinse off the extra. It does smell nice when put on but hours later it smells just like any other tanning stink but that is to be expected. Have this being delivered every 2 months. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of fake tanning. Some wear off on your clothing, don&#x27;t make you tan, smell bad, make you orange, etc. This is great! It is easy to put on, smells good and it looks like I have spent hours in the tanning bed with just two applications and I was able to wear a white shirt right after applying and letting dry and it didn&#x27;t get on my clothing. This will be in my collection from now on. No more sun for me I have found the perfect tan! As mentioned in another comment, make sure to clean your mitt with water after every use!</li>
            <li> Love the color and the mitt. The only thing I would complain about is the spray bottle stopped working about half way through.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I put it on at night before I go to bed. I usually wear pajamas over it it might make them brown on the inside around the collar/cuff but don&#x27;t worry it comes out when you wash your clothes. I use the glove, it works great to make the tan solution go in evenly. When you shower in the morning you&#x27;re left with an awesome little glow. Nothing dark (I guess you could re-apply the next night to go darker) but I have super white light skin so I&#x27;m good with the shade it gives me. It is the only fake tan I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t look orange or fake. Be careful, the bottle does leak like crazy. You have to store it upright in a plastic bag or something. I seriously treat it like nuclear waste, it has its own little spot because otherwise it will leak/stain everything! It even leaks a bit while spraying/using, they need to fix that because the product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this self tanner. Every time I applied it, the color would wash off easily! I literally had to apply it consistently to get the desired color. I tried may products and the best one is called tropical self tanner! It smells Awesome, it doesn&#x27;t smere and you can instantly see the difference!</li>
            <li> Love the immediate result, but fades fast. The smell makes up for the lack of endurance in color though. The application mitt is AMAZING, although its surface becomes less applicable, the nap enhances your initial results. No streaking!</li>
            <li> I must say i swear by this stuff. it only takes one application to get nice and tan!! i don&#x27;t come out orange-y like i do when i go to the tanning salon to get a spray tan. it looks great on my skin-tone and the smell is nice too. and i love the glove applicator. awesome!! I&#x27;ll be using this again this summer. I&#x27;m going to get the pre-application stuff because this time..it did tend to get into my pores on my legs but not as bad as others in the past.</li>
            <li> PROS: 1. GOES ON EASY WITH  MIT,NO STREAKS!&lt;br /&gt;  2. NOT ORANGE AT ALL, NICE AND BROWN NOT SUPER DARK.. LOOKS NATURAL&lt;br /&gt;  3. NICE LIGHT SWEET SMELL&lt;br /&gt;  4. NOT MESSY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1 THIS DOES FADE AFTER YOU SOWER ( STILL ON BUT LIGHTER SHADE)&lt;br /&gt;  2. NOT SUPER DARK IF THATS WHAT YOU WANT,MAY BE ABLE TO LAYER BUT THEN IT MAY NOT LOOK AS NATURAL OR LAY ON SKIN OR PORES AS WELL ,THAT MIGHT BE WHY OTHER FAIR SKIN PEOPLE SAID THEM COMPLAINTS,THEY MUST BE PUTTING ON  TO MUCH? THEY ALSO SAY TO USE THE OIL TO ELP FOR AREA THAT ARE DRY OR UNEVEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT SURE WY PEOPLE SAY ITS MESSY, I DIDNT GET IT ON ANYTHING, SIMPLY AIM AND SPRAY CLOSE TO MITT  OVER YOU SINK..LITTLE AT A TIME TO AVOID WASTE, I SPRAY 1-2 SPRAYS AND RUB ON TILL IT SEEMS DRYER THEN DO AGAIN...&lt;br /&gt;I AM A MED FAIR SKIN PERSON, BUT I TAN EASY,JUST TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM BEDS SINCE THEY AGE YOU FASTER.. THIS IS ONLY FAKE TAN IVE USED AND WILL -PLAN ON BUYING AGAIN, UNLIKE OTHERS ITS ACTUALLY BROWN! NOT SUPER DARK LIKE I SAID BUT IT A MEDIUM BROWN AND I HARDLY HAD TO USE ANY SO MAYBE IF YOU USED A TAD MORE AFTER FIRST LAYER IT MIGHT GET DARKER.. IT DRYS SUPER FAST! I WOULD FOLLOW BOX DIRECTIONS AND EXFOLIATE FIRST AND SHOWER FIRST AND DONT PUT ON TILL YOU ARE ALL THE WAY DRY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE SAID IT CAME OFF ON SHEETS, DIDNT SEE THAT BUT AGAIN I DIDNT USE TO MUCH SO MAYBE TAT IS THE ISSUE ,MAYBE ITS BEST NOT TO OVER USE.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT DOES SMELL NICE! KINDA A LIGHT SWEET SMELL,&lt;br /&gt;YES IT DOES FADE AS BOX SAYS AS WELL, BUT PEOPLE SAID IT ALL CAME OFF,I DONT USE A STRONG SOWER GEL/SOAP  AND I TRYED SCRUBBING LIGHTER IN SHOWER TO AVOID MORE FADE,&lt;br /&gt;OVER ALL ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND I HAVE USE FOR 2 WEEKS NOW!&lt;br /&gt;P.S I USE ON MY FACE TO AND PLAN TO TRY THE FACE FAKE BAKE THO SINCE ITS MADE FOR FACE AN IS ANTI AGE!?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. With the applicator it is easy to apply by myself all over. The color is instant and very natural (with no glitter)! The only thing I wish is that the color would stay a little longer. If I put it on one day it pretty much comes off with the following shower. The smell is very mild as well. Also for the size of the bottle it does last quite a while. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and still love it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and always have had trouble tanning in beds.  I was searching for a product to use at home with instant results.  This product did just that.  Using the professional mitt you get an even tan that is not in anyway orange! I love this stuff, I put it on before I go out and usually touch it up every 4 days or so. Oh and it does not have a nasty smell to it either! I suggest this to anyone who wants an instant even all over tan!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tan I have ever used! And I have used plenty!</li>
            <li> Best tanner I have ever used! Easy to apply, dries quickly and nice brown color (no orange tint at all!)</li>
            <li> This one is horrible. My skin broke and I do not think organic or natural at all.</li>
            <li> I worked in a tanning salon for 4 years. I stopped tanning because of how many customers would come in crying about getting skin cancer (yet they still tanned?) My husband had made the rude comment of \\&quot;You should tan, you look better that way\\&quot; As furious as i was i did my research for a spray on tanner because at the tanning salons it ALWAYS makes you orange. I took a chance on this and i can not believe how beautiful it goes on. Its perfect! a nice bronze, not to dark, not to light, color. i will be buying this for years to come. i am so so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I had a baby 7 months ago. My body is finally back in shape but I have some stretch marks. I wanted a tan to kinda shade them but didnt want to lay in a horrible tanning bed. I searched for a place for an airbrush tan so I would have a flawless tan. I paid $35 for an organic airbrush tan. I liked it, but it was so messy and was all over my clothes until I took that first shower. After it faded I got FakeBake as it was recommended to me by a friend. I LOVE this stuff. Once I got it out of the box I just sprayed it into the glove that&#x27;s provided and wiped myself all down. Instant flawless tan, no streaks! And it darkened over the next few hours and just looked better and better! Even better is, it did not rub off a single bit on to my clothing! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a great spray tan. The pump lets you control where to put it on and you are not all orangey like others leave you. It dries very fast (2 min) and does not leave stains on your clothes. Put it on and go. No worries about streaks or discoloring. I have recommended this to others &amp; they too love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Great! You won&#x27;t go wrong. I do clean and shave my mit. Don&#x27;t rub it on hard just smooth it on. If you mes up it wears of easily a+ do it 2 nights in a roll go for 3-4 days! Not yellowish orange at all! I do put a small amount on my face.i done got 2 friends using it and my husband loved it... Good smell. Drys fast. And very very easy to put on..I spray it on my mitt and start from the top of my leg and work my way down when I get to my feet I just use what&#x27;s already in my mitt I do my toes also.. All A+!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it enough, Fake Bake Flawless is amazing! I just used it. It was so easy and idiot proof. The color shows immediately and you just rub the spray on. I also read a lot of reviews saying to spray the product on your skin then rub it in because it&#x27;s definitely more effective and you lose liquid by spraying it into the glove which i agree. The scent reminds me of the beach like a smell between coconut and pina colada. The color showing looks like I just I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while and so natural.. when really it was just one application i applied and i normally have pretty light skin.I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle because I&#x27;m in love with this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this product. It is a quick and easy tanning system for a very busy mom that I am. On the other hand, I feel like the glove is a little small in length (or I just have big hands) &amp; it does not make you SUPER dark the first time you use it (like I was thinking/ hoping it would).  It is a little difficult to keep the glove on my hand while rubbing in the tanning spray. But I also use daily tented moisturizer &amp; Fake Bake helps to give that a boost and make you darker OVER TIME. Being patient with it and using it consistently I think will give the best results. It also smells really good and makes your skin soft after application.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I got it within a week and tried it as soon as it came in the mail! I&#x27;d recommend it to absolutely anyone! Oh, and it smells amazing instead of that nasty self tanning smell! (:</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin and have feared the streakiness that self tanners normally leave behind, not to mention the horrid orange tint..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not that. This is in a league of it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have keratosis pilaris on my arms (red bumps &amp;#34;acne like&amp;#34;) and I resort to tanning to help take away the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying on wedding dresses tomorrow and needed something to cover up the KP, so I researched all over for the perfect &amp;#34;tanning solution&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results. Even coverage. Natural color. Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it! :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Just don&#x27;t like how long it lasts. Instant quick fix for pasty skin. It gives you an even tan without streaking. But you must exfoliate well before using! Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> It gives a very nice dark tan. The mitt was awesome. Definitely better than anything I&#x27;ve found at the drugstore and wasn&#x27;t much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used California Tan Bronzing spray ONLY for the last year, so I was nervous about trying a new and different product. I decided to try something else because the Cali Tan Spray is more like a bronzing last minute spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day before tanning I showered and shaved. You should not shave immediately before using self tan lotion/spray because the open pores cause the color to seep in and look spotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day of using the fake bake i used my Baiden Mitten. After completely drying off I followed the directions and began my fake bake. When I opened package to the Fake Bake Flawless, I remember reading a review about it regarding snipping the end of the spray tube that goes inside the bottle. So, I cut about a half inch off the bottom of the tube then twisted it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a-maz-ing. Absolutely NO streaking. NO orange color (the tan color is perfect shade for me) NO nasty smell. Even my 10 yr old daughter came in right after and said &amp;#34;mmm mommy it smells like coconut in here&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;**I use California Tan Expose lotion the next day and a few days after. Keeps tan looking great, moisturizes and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> This was good. So as others have said, you must be very careful, because you can get streaky. But if you are through and work small sections of your body ( such as foot and ankle vs whole left leg) before moving on you can avoid streaks. The color is beautiful and actually looks like a tan. A little too perfect of a tan. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the missing 5th star. Others have said it doesn&#x27;t smell, that is sort of true. It doesn&#x27;t smell at first, but after a few hours, that fake tanner smell comes. And I&#x27;ve found that it comes in full force when I go to the gym.</li>
            <li> Got immediate color, however it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day or two at most. FYI when applying this tanner do it in the shower or else it gets everywhere in the bathroom. Lots of compliments over the color though!</li>
            <li> The color is OK. For reference I have medium skin tone, nc30 and This just gave me a slight shade darker. maybe nc 35. I applied this at night, and The entire night I WAS ITCHING EVERYWHERE!!!! My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive either. i DONT apply this on my face, since I exfoliate daily. but on my body. it was a disaster. the color payoff was seldom and the itching was major. I mad sure to apply this evenly, the morning after I washed my face and got some water running down my arm, it left a LONG white streak and didnt go away till after I exfoliated 2-3x. Streaky. NOT the best ive ever tried.. OVERRATED! and i bought this b/c of a youtube Guru..never again</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skinned. I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products and haven&#x27;t come across any that have actually been streak free or good smelling. This one does smell the best of ones I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s kind of a chocolatey scent rather than full on fake tan smell. The streaking of it however was ridiculous. I exfoliated with a sugar scrub and used the included mitt to apply. On one leg I sprayed the product directly onto my skin and smoothed it over with the mitt, the other leg I sprayed to the mitt then applied to my skin. Both ways it clumped up like eraser shavings all over my legs. The color guard was awesome, however it settled in every fine line I have. The color payoff is very good as well, but I would only recommend this to darker skin tones. It has almost a red-brown undertone to it which sounds intimidating but I it had applied nicely to my skin I would have loved it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it goes on with immediate color, dries fact, lasts 4-5 days, and does not have that self-tan odor!  However, it is hard to apply to the face with that large mitt, and it definitely makes the pores more noticeable - need to include a smaller facial applier!  I&#x27;ve tried cotton balls, and that works better than the mitt.  It also leaves tiny little dark specks (like dirt) on my chest - and it does come off on your clothing, no matter how long you wait after applying it to get dressed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Not smelly, get you dark very fast and dry very fast too compare to other sunless tanning lotion. I just use it twice and my friend thought that I went on tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying more next week and be ready for summer.</li>
            <li> Its really great stuff. I do however encourage that you build a bit of a real, base tan before you start using the product. I think it would go on a lot nicer. Even without the base tan though I was extremely happy with the streak free, easy application, BROWN not orange results :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon after using Bare Minerals Faux Tan for 2 years.  It was a much  more reasonably priced option and it actually got better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have found, after using it for a couple of weeks:  it gives you a very nice, &#x27;warm&#x27; colored complexion. It&#x27;s VERY easy to apply. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing (unless you get some on when applying...it doesn&#x27;t wear off overnight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what I have NOT gotten out of it?  The nice, deeper color I had hoped for, after using the other product.  This one seems to reach its peak after a couple of days and does not get darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the  color for spring. I love how easy it is to apply and that it goes on evenly&amp;#62; I just wish it got me &#x27;tan&#x27;...as opposed to having nice color.</li>
            <li> First, I love the mitt...works very well, wish I could buy separately. The liquid itself is a great color on the skin as you apply it. It dries quickly and its so easy to apply with the mitt. Best of all is the lack of self tan smell....it smells great. However, Im discovering as I use it that the lack of self tanner smell may because there is not much self tanning with this product. Although the color is good when you put it on, it seems to wash off almost completely. I have to reapply daily or every other day so far. Every other day so that I can moisturize in between. The liquid is quite drying.  But as a &amp;#34;quick put this on  before going out &amp;#34; kinda tan this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have not rated this product cause I haven&#x27;t have time to actually try it.  I did want to comment that the seller was super quick in placing the order in the mail.  I think I ordered it on a Thursday evening and I had it by the following Wed/Thurs.  That was just regular shipping!  The projected date was much later.  I appreciated that the seller was so prompt in sending the order.  The product was in perfect condition and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After searching the web for a recommended at-home product, I decided to order Fake Bake. Although my tan did not turn out quite as dark as I would have liked, I was pleased with the results. I love that this product is tinted! Other products I have tried end up looking orange or leave me with streaks and missed spots. I prefer creating my own Fake Bake tan rather than paying for a spray tan; I received better results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It gives you a nice tan without looking orange. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that I felt like it didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected. So great for date night or beach trips that you need a quick tan! But really a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Using Fake Bake I like the way that it smells. It applies very well and after drying and letting it soak into my skin it was not streaky at all. I&#x27;ve tried many tanning products and this one is by far one of the best, at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> this stuff works great no marks or anything :) it looks really natural on. When i tell people its fake tanner they&#x27;re like &amp;#34; no way!&amp;#34; hahaha i really am so happy i bought this stuff i totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I like it! Looked streaky when I first applied it but it all evened out over night.  Nice color and easy to use.  The smell can be a little annoying after a while though.</li>
            <li> I have tried every self-tanner on the market.  I have fair skin and have used self-tanners for 18 years. From the very high-end to the drugstore brand and I can unequivocally say, this is the best self-tanner out there, period.  If you properly prepare your skin, exfoliate and shave, you will love this product. One application will last over a week for me.  I will add that I dry skin brush my skin daily which also helps with exfoliation and deep penetration of this product.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, nasty odor like most self-tanners, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and it lasts with a rich brown NOT orange color.  I cannot recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> This is the best Fake tan product on the market. It has all great reviews, easy on,&lt;br /&gt;lasts for up to a week or more. Comes with gloves. 5 stars on this one. Get it now for that all year round tan, that looks like you travel and get a real tan.</li>
            <li> You can see where applied and even out before it dries and the color is very natural looking (Bye Bye ORANGE!). After exfoliating well (don&#x27;t forget toes), apply just a dab of lotion (any brand) on feet, knees and elbows before using Fake Bake. You will have a very believable sun-kissed look. My only reason for not giving this product 5 stars is the &#x27;tan&#x27; starts fading in 2-3 days and starts looking kind of blotchy, so the cycle must be repeated. I will most likely use this for special occasions.</li>
            <li> This is an instant bronzing product... Especially can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> I know it is hard to decipher real versus fake reviews, but I&#x27;m a 32 year old mom of 2 boys (3 &amp; 1) from Michigan. I have extremely sensitive skin and am pale as heck. I bought this after reading tons of reviews, mind you I have used Jergens to Sublime to whatever else I picked up at CVS to get a gorgeous glow. Fail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Fake Bake. It is so easy to apply. You get gloves, plus the mit, so there is no way you can screw it up.  I found it a bit hard to use the mit with the gloves on, just cause it kept slipping, but it still blended. [I took off the rubber gloves eventually]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a gorgeous tan. No orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate!!&lt;br /&gt;Put a moisturizer on your knees &amp; elbows first, then let dry. (I used Neutrogena seasame body oil)&lt;br /&gt;Cut the straw before you put it in the bottle to avoid leakage.&lt;br /&gt;Blend blend blend using the mit. Then blend some more.&lt;br /&gt;Hang out naked for a bit. Let it dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!  Don&#x27;t over think it cause it really is fail proof if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but since this was a beauty product and I am all about sharing with anyone who will listen about good products...This fake bake does exactly what it says!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO orange tint....no real dark on my knees or ankles, etc. either!&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to take a bath, and exfoliate really good all over!! Even your face! Rinse and don&#x27;t put on any lotion, perfumes or deodorant! I like to do it at night, let it dry for a couple hours then go to sleep and then you could take a shower the next morning.....Either way, you will see INSTANT tanning with this awesome stuff....use the gloves and applicator mitt that comes with it!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to get in the tanning bed again...no more of that! And its still too early for laying out at the creek or the pool, so I wanted a start on my tan since I am wearing my shorts...This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;you will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Great product :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use those gradual tanners but they never actually tanned me, probably because I&#x27;m so pale. I Used this and it looked great! Very subtle. I used it again and put 2 coats on at once, i was slightly orange the first day but then a nice tan for the rest of the week :) Great product, will buy again~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the 60 minute fake bake and used it yesterday and it looks fabulous~</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have very fair, sensitive skin, so I have difficulty finding a tanning product that works well for my skin. This stuff gives me a great brown color  - NO ORANGE (yay!). I&#x27;m on my second bottle (the first lasted over a month I think), and have learned some tricks since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;-A&amp;D Ointment: If you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re legs itch like crazy after applying this stuff, make sure to put a thin layer of A &amp; D ointment wherever is sensitive BEFORE you apply the product. Also, put the ointment on your knees, feet, hands, and elbows. It keeps it from absorbing too much into your skin and making it look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;-Spray straight on the skin: I know it says to spray on the mitt, but I just spray it right on the skin and immediately rub it in with the mitt. The mitt absorbs a lot of the product, and it&#x27;ll last longer if you spray a few times and then rub it in. I do spray it on the mitt for hard-to-reach spots, knees, feet, hands, and my face.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate: I exfoliate about every 4-5 days (anytime I start seeing build-up) with exfoliating gloves. If you don&#x27;t, the tan will start looking uneven.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize: I apply the product at night (after a shower), and then shower again in the morning to rinse it off. After it&#x27;s rinsed off, I moisturize with Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender. I&#x27;m sure you can use whatever kind works for you, just as long as you moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;-Warning: It will come off on your sheets and clothes. You&#x27;ll find that with ANY self-tanner. There&#x27;s just no way around it. However, since you rinse this kind off after you apply it, I&#x27;ve noticed it comes off on the clothes a lot less than others do. It IS all over my used-to-be-white sheets, though. Small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps anyone thinking about buying this product! It really is all about trial and error. You&#x27;ll find what works best for you. But this product is definitely great and (after trying TONS of self-tanners) this BY FAR is #1 (and inexpensive!).</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of tanning beds for a long time.. but I dont want to get sick from them so I stopped going in them... all the self tanners I have tried previously made me look oompa loompa orange or they were that and streaky... I saw the reviews on this and so I bought it... I love this stuff... gets you looking like you went somewhere nice and hot and spent your whole time laying out when really you just spent a few minutes rubbing the fake bake flawless in... It was easy you cant screw it up... I will continue using this product :)</li>
            <li> I Love love love fake bake!! This is my favorite self tanner! it is so easy to apply with the mitt and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky like most other ma do. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The product was easy to apply went on nice and even. However....... I look like a carrot! My worst nightmare about sunless tanners is looking orange and it happened with this product. I have medium toned skin so I am not fair complected at all. I exfoliated before applying the product followed the directions verbatim. Took my shower in the morning scrubbed my body and I am ORANGE! Unless I have some unrealistic idea of what a tan should look like?? Which I am sure I don&#x27;t  this product turned me into a darn carrot. I gave this product three stars because the ease of application, but a one because it is just like all the rest for me and gave me horrible \\&quot;unreal\\&quot; looking results. So hopefully it works for other people obviously it has, but for me I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used EVERY self tanner on the market - from drugstore to super expensive - this product blows them all out of the water. Goes on super smooth, no streaking. You can see where you&#x27;re putting it as you&#x27;re applying. I had color immediately - no orange. I was very skeptical of the mitt, but I was really pleasantly surprised at how nicely &amp; smoothly it applies the product. I used it to even out a weird sunburn on my legs and shoulders so I could wear a short dress to a wedding, and it was perfect!! The best part is that it DOESN&#x27;T SMELL! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough - it really is foolproof. I may never spray in a salon again!</li>
            <li> ...and I have not stepped into the sun. I&#x27;m not really one for laying out and doing nothing but soaking up the sun. Nor am I into getting condensed UV rays from a box. And when I am out hiking or working outside, Obviously I&#x27;m not near naked doing so. I think people look healthier with a modest dose of color on them and I have finally found a sunless tanner that is NOT ORANGE and IS AFFORDABLE!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE! I research everything before I buy. SO I read a lot of these reviews. The major complaint was the dripping of the bottle. Someone posted on here to cut the spray tube before use (like 1.5&amp;#34;?). I of course didn&#x27;t really understand until I got the bottle. When I did, it seemed like a no-brainer. I have NO CLUE why they such a long tube. But line it up with the bottom of the bottle and trim. I have not had one issue with dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they&#x27;d give you two mitts. I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and mine is not longer soft but it still works.</li>
            <li> I love it very good no mess!!! I will buy it again, I would recommend this product to everyone! Enjoy a tan without worry of skin cancer</li>
            <li> I love the bronze color it gives my skin! deff not the orangy color ive gotten from other spray tans ive tried. I would recommend really exfoliating your skin before applying so u dont get any uneven patches and keep your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, hands down the best sunless tanner on the market.  And I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Seriously.  All of them.  Nice and dark, super even finish.  Goof proof- and I mean goof proof.  If you screw this tanner up, you probably should give up sunless tanning all together.  Wear gloves, though.  Tanner can bleed through the buffing mitt.  And it really stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to exfoliate, then shave and of course, lotion up with something light.  I spray tanner directly onto my body working small areas at a time.  Like, the top of my arm all the way around, then bottom of my arm, etc.  Buff lightly onto feet and hands using the buffing mitt only.  I use this right before bed and wake up with a gorgeous glow.  Shower off in the a.m., and go to work feeling like a beautiful, bronzed goddess.  And between you and me, my boss is kinda hot. So little confidence boosts are always welcome.  Anywho, if you&#x27;ve never used this stuff, I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon, but after using Fake Bake Flawless last night, I felt that I absolutely MUST!  Application was very easy, but I felt like I might have been over stressing about applying it evenly on my body.  I kept going back over certain areas thinking that I didn&#x27;t get enough coverage, then I thought, \\&quot;oh great, now this spot will be darker.\\&quot;  I spent a little too much time fussing over it.  Finally, I just put my pjs on and headed to bed.  (The smell is great by the way!  My fiancé cuddled with me all night because he said he liked how I smelled! Haha) I was worried that I would wake up blotchy or streaky from over thinking the applying process, but when I looked in the mirror this morning......  I saw a smooth, even, golden brown tan all over my body!!!! I don&#x27;t know how, but the tan really evened itself out over night.  It is just simply amazing.  I don&#x27;t have time to get out in the sun (nor do i really want to fry myself) but this makes me look and feel like i just got back from an island vacation!  I feel like a new woman!  Thank you Fake Bake :)</li>
            <li> Sooo great.  I love this stuff.  I am in no way related to this product....just your average person.  This is the BEST self tanner ever.  No weird smell.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with getting it all over like other people say.  I wonder if they&#x27;re spraying on their body instead of in the mitt.  You&#x27;re supposed to spray into the mitt and rub on your body.  If you do that, there&#x27;s no mess.  Color looks great.  No streaks!</li>
            <li> I am puzzled as to why so many people like this product.  It is a pain to apply--unlike the self-tanning lotions, this is just dye, which you have to wear gloves and a little mitt to apply.  It&#x27;s also finicky--I could not prevent the color from catching in, and darkening, my pores. It&#x27;s also a fairly dark color, which I did not want, because I just need a little color, not to look like I actually do spend a ton of time in the sun/tanning salon.  The most annoying thing about this product is that it literally sweats off (I had brown sweat running down my legs), and the color doesn&#x27;t last much more than a day.  This is definitely going back.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My favorite is still the Fake Bake mousse, but this is a close second! Gotta watch the mitt, sometimes starts to slide off your hand while applying.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is as good as it gets as far as sunless tanning goes!! I would recommend it to anyone who wants&lt;br /&gt;a tan without the sun!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish I had discovered this years ago!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews, and I am so happy I did. This didn&#x27;t turn me orange, didn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, even right after I applied it, it didn&#x27;t streak, and it looked natural!&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure to bend your joints (elbows, knees, knuckles, etc.) when applying. If you don&#x27;t, you will be able to see lighter lines when you bend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I always spray on the mitt, and then use it to rub on my body. I don&#x27;t spray directly onto my body. I have found that it&#x27;s a lot neater this way, and less clean-up afterwards. i have never had a streaking problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Spots that are often missed:  Ears, behind the ears, neck, back of the neck, underside of arms, tops of feet/toes, tops of hands/toes, and inner and back of thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Exfoliate one to two times per week. Don&#x27;t use the product right before you exfoliate, because it will take off some of your tan. I use it right after, then every 3 days after that. I, personally, only exfoliate once per week and have never had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Use it at night. I have let this dry for 5-10 minutes, then have put my pajamas on...White pajamas! And I didn&#x27;t see any streaks on my body, or any orange streaks on my clothes. I did, however, accidentally spray it on a pair of white pants, and it washed right off in the washing machine. I was kind of reluctant to use it at night before bed, but it didn&#x27;t effect my tan at all, even if I was laying on the pillow all night. YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSED TO RINSE IT OFF IN THE MORNING. If you leave it on, you will wake up looking dirty, but once you shower and rinse it off, it will look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best parts about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out! I have very sensitive skin, and was reluctant to try, but I haven&#x27;t broken out yet and have used this product at least 10 times!</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the way to go! It works so good and you get such a nice bronze color! The only downside I would say is to definetly cut the stem to the spray part or it will leak(once you cut it there&#x27;s no leakage) and to apply it as even as you can. I applied it a little uneven the 1st time I did it and some spots were whiter than others but the nice thing is that, you can just do touch ups without any hassel. This stuff smells delicious too! :)</li>
            <li> Over the past month or two I have tried several different self tanning products, this is by far the best! The application is easy and the mitt is great for preventing steaks. The price is awesome too!</li>
            <li> I have used Fake Bake products off &amp; on for 5 years and I have loved it from the first time I used it. I started using the lotion &amp; this year I decided to get the flawless spray. It is the only product I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, and looks like a natural tan. I am very pale &amp; always burn so fake bake has been a wonderful product for me. I exfoliate before I use it &amp; after reading other reviews I trimmed the tip off the spray bottle so it has never leaked from the top as have been some reviewers complaints. I also have washed the mitt after each use to prolong the life of it &amp; to keep it soft so the spray continues to go on streak free. To get the tan I want I use Fake Bake about 3 days in a row &amp; then I reapply about every 3 days. I feel like it fades out waiting a whole week to reapply. I also do use it on my face. I just use a make up sponge to apply &amp; have never had a problem with it clogging my pores or streaking. Definitely cheaper than getting spray tanned professionally &amp; I like the results even better than a spray tan.</li>
            <li> Leaves splotches and where u shave looks HORRIBLE with stained hair folical, tan fast, nice color, and works decent. Ok product</li>
            <li> Fake bake flawless self tanner was the biggest waste of time of my life! When you spray it out on your skin it comes out spotty so it&#x27;s hard to get an even tan. My skin looked horrible like I had some disease where I was tan in some spots but super white in others.</li>
            <li> I have been a self-tanning semi-pro ever since I started working as a nurse in dermatology practices 5 years ago. Seeing all those patients having skin cancer surgeries and seeing so much prematurely aging skin scared the sense into me, and I am now a dilligent daily sunscreen user. That said, I don&#x27;t want to look like a cave-dwelling mutant, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with self-tanners ever since. I was finally able to stop searching for something better after discovering Fake Bake! I have been in love with Fake Bake products for years now, but this new formula is by far their best yet!! The formula dries very quickly, yet allows you just the right amount of time to smooth it on evenly. By the time I am done with my full body application, I can immediately put on my pajamas and not worry about it making my tan streaky.With this product, gone are the days of applying your self-tanner and spending the rest of your evening sticky, afraid to sit down or put clothes on, etc. Additionally, the smell is fantastic, and even in the morning before I wash it off, the self-tanner smell IS there, but it&#x27;s much more subtle than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, including the Fake Bake foam and lotion formulas. Best of all, the color is truly realistic and not orange! I LOVE the application mitt and how much easier it makes the tanning process!! It used to feel as if tanning was such a time-consuming task to me, but with this, I am done with my entire body in 10 mins tops, and I never have to worry if I applied it evenly enough or gave it enough time to soak in before dressing. I wake up with a consistently even, believable tan every time. I even had several patients jokingly scold me on my tan, and they were shocked when I confessed it was fake! Lastly, the price on Amazon cannot be beat!! I buy it two bottles at a time, even though one lasts me a long time, just because I NEVER want to be without it! Please tell all your friends about it so they never stop making this stuff! I planto be a lifelong customer!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Minimal smell. Streak free. Great fade. Wish the glove stayed on better but what a great and crucial piece to avoid orange spots and hand stains.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I had anticipated</li>
            <li> Hello tan without orange! Goes on even and looks totally natural. Not messy and easy to use. Washes off evenly too.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells great! Goes on so quickly and easily. Beautiful brown color, not orange. I&#x27;ve yet to experience it leaving color on my clothes or sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like so when I finish this bottle I&#x27;m going to try Fake Bake Darker. Also, it wasn&#x27;t as dummy proof as I&#x27;d hoped. I ended up with some streaky/unnatural looking areas around my hands, feet, and ankles after one of my applications. I assume it&#x27;s just operator error I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d even fault the product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions: Cut the plastic piece attached to the sprayer. Mine was way too long for the bottle and I&#x27;d seen another review mention this also. Also, I saw that some reviews complained of the mitt being too large for their hands. I experienced this as well and to solve it, I just spread my fingers out really wide to keep the mitt in place. If you should end up with some areas darker than others, just exfoliate those spots rather heavily and they will blend in fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: I showered, exfoliated, and put on NO moisturizer. I put on the gloves provided and sprayed the product on the mitt. I used it very sparingly since I was afraid I&#x27;d goof it up. I removed the gloves and used the leftover residue to apply product to my hands and feet. I went to bed and the next morning I could tell a noticeable difference in my skin color. I got a shower and rinsed (not scrubbed or washed) and the color faded only ever so slightly. However, it still wasn&#x27;t very dark. I&#x27;m of medium skin tone and I&#x27;m assuming this happened because I applied the product so sparingly. So, I tried again the next day.This time I used the same regime, only I applied the product quite liberally. The next morning I noticed streaks in areas such as ankles, feet, and hands. I then jumped in the shower and exfoliated those areas extra vigorously and the streakiness blended away. I continue to use this product, usually 2 or3 days in a row to build the tan. It still isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s far better than any drug store product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
