            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m light-skinned of Scandinavian descent and I burn easily in the sun, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>

            <li>I have nice color that stops at my wrists</li>
            <li>I have a nice tan and glow.</li>
            <li>It has a tolerable scent, and it&#x27;s nice how it&#x27;s tinted</li>
            <li>--it turned out beautifully with no streaks, no \\&quot;orange\\&quot;, and just the right color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your palms and fingernails to or they will be tan as well! :)</li>
            <li>There is no way I can be seen in bright light until this stuff wears off.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it gives me the best, most natural looking color.</li>
            <li>This worked better than any self tanner that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I was extremely pleased.     </li>
            <li>My legs love the stuff.     </li>
            <li>You have to make sure you put it on evenly to avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple bottles of this and it used to be my favorite self tanning product.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it in thoroughly and made sure that I could no longer see any of the tint.  </li>
            <li>There are so many sparkles in it, it almost looks like something a child would wear.      </li>
            <li>but this was way over the top.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff</li>
            <li>i get a lot of comments of how good my tan looks and that i must spend a lot of time outside LOL</li>
            <li>Create a great natural looking tan!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously been happy with the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime in the orange container (it does a great job</li>
            <li>This self tanner does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>My experience from using this self tanner was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and if I messed up I just wiped it off or rubbed it in better.</li>
            <li>This is a great self-tanner that fades naturally and does not streak when applied to exfolliated skin--</li>
            <li>It gives good, natural color that is noticeable after one application,  and gets better after every use.</li>
            <li>But once dry my skin is smooth and feels almost like I&#x27;d used a very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>just a light exfoliant is needed beforehand.</li>
            <li>I took a shower and applied it as directed, lightly all over the body, like a lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s almost two years without tanning - you can imagine how light I am.       </li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product may work well for people who have medium or light olive skin tones.  </li>
            <li>(I use the bronzer in the morning and lotion at night).&lt;br /&gt;Positives: It shows up the day you put it on, so it&#x27;s easy to cover up streaks quickly.  </li>
            <li>Try mixing it with our favorite body lotion--it worked really well!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply, as long as you immediately remove the excess, as is true of any self-tanning product, and results in good coloration &amp; tan simulation.  </li>
            <li>A controversial, highly regulated and restricted additive to self-tanners that contains toxins.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure you rub it in very thoroughly, to avoid streaks.    </li>
            <li>The bronzer also gives you good instant color and helps you to see if you&#x27;ve applied the product evenly or missed spots.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate really well before applying this lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t come off onto clothes.</li>
            <li>But after you shower that pretty much goes away and you keep most the color.</li>
            <li>I now have a great colour all year round.</li>
            <li>It has tiny shimmer sparkles in it, which make the skin on your body look amazing after application.    </li>
            <li>I woke up this morning and it was apparent (even more than the night before)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the sparkles in it very much.</li>
            <li>DO wash your hands well after application, especially if you, like me, have calluses on your hands, they will absorb more color and turn orange.</li>
            <li>First ingredient is mineral (baby) oil.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that this product could NOT be used on your face or on your body in the daytime (unless you have a stage job in Vegas).</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanning products &amp; always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I ended up washing it off.  </li>
            <li>just tried this morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>The key is to REALLY make sure you have blended it well against your skin</li>
            <li>(The product description was accurate in that it does dry quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the \\&quot;sparkles\\</li>
            <li>I really like this self-tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li>Fact remains that our skin is a highly absorbing organ and anything we rub into our skin, will end up in our blood stream.</li>
            <li>very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>I washed my hands really well after I applied the lotion</li>
            <li>this product works very well and no streaks</li>
            <li>I only have to use two days in a row to get a nice deep tan which lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves a pretty sparkle similar to tiny glitter flakes, which is why I say it&#x27;s not for men :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel-like consistency and has a decent scent, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I saw that they still sell the older Sublime product (in the orange bottle).  </li>
            <li>Also, it is important to wash your hands after application, as well as use a wet folded tissue, cotton ball, or make-up pad to remove any of the lotion from where your hair or beard meet skin, to avoid your hair in those areas turning orange!</li>
            <li>and I live in the north, so</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>It tans evenly &amp; looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I just found the shimmer a little bit too much for every day use - a special occasion product.</li>
            <li>Also, because the color is so dark on the first application it makes mistakes pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>so I rated this very high on my shopping list in the future</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not crucial that you exfoliate so much that you hurt your skin...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do much outdoorsy stuff last summer</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of compliments on how natural my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; looks.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I could use this ON STAGE for something theatrical - but for real life, they have ruined it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better self tanning products I have used it gives a rich dark tan if desired or can use less often for a medium color tan the tan last a good amount of time so once you get to the desired shade you want you only have to use every few days or less to keep the color</li>
            <li>Quick dry, instant color is seen while the gradual tanner does its job!</li>
            <li>and I love the subtle glitter it lends to my skin.</li>
            <li>The product is very sticky even long after application.  </li>
            <li>so I mixed it with Jergens lotion and just completely covered my arms &amp; legs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a handful of sunless tanning lotions in the past, but none have produced an effect as quickly as L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze Tinted Self Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much that I made a silly review video for it! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UXItKzep6ns</li>
            <li>The reasonable cost is astounding because in the past I have up to $40 for a self- tanner that doesn&#x27;t even compare to the color and longevity of ths one!!!!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it right on your hands to.</li>
            <li> I use just a small bit and the scent is very strong and unpleasant; very chemical smelling in nature.</li>
            <li> I used only enough to spread evenly on my skin and rubbed it in thoroughly, and it dried instantly.</li>
            <li> It tends to rub off on clothes, even after you&#x27;ve let it dry.</li>
            <li> I was always careful to only wear dark clothing after applying it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels a little dry after applying, so I need to apply body lotion later</li>
            <li> : It can still streak or rub off a few minutes after you think it&#x27;s dry, so wait 5-10 minutes extra.</li>
            <li> Now I only apply the product when I&#x27;m not leaving the house for a few hours and then ash it off before going to bed</li>
            <li> Up close, my face almost looks wet in sunlight and my friends always ask me why I am sweating.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused reading the reviews by people who said it took too long to dry; my question for them is, how much are you using?</li>
            <li> My legs are a mess to the point where I just went to the gym, glanced down at my legs, and got back in the car.</li>

            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was splotchy (unlike the other Sublime product I&#x27;d used previously) and looked like I&#x27;d spent a sweaty day wearing too-dark foundation.    </li>
            <li> This one was really dark</li>
            <li> all of this boils down to is</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the color development because I haven&#x27;t had the stuff on my skin long enough, but even if the color was fantastic, it still wouldn&#x27;t make up for the horrible glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> result is a slight bronze color, NOT orange like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is amazing! Quick dry, instant color is seen while the gradual tanner does its job! Perfect for legs, and face! The touch of shimmer in the lotion also helps give an instant summer glow!</li>
            <li> This product was just like the one I use to buy but can no longer find in the drugstores around me. I bought three tubes and I hope I can still get it when I run out again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tanner!!  I am very pale and not very patient about working with self-tanners.  This one was really dark so I mixed it with Jergens lotion and just completely covered my arms &amp; legs--it turned out beautifully with no streaks, no \\&quot;orange\\&quot;, and just the right color.  Try mixing it with our favorite body lotion--it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product but it was ok anyway. I wanted the sublime moisturizer with skin tone enhancements and got the tinted self-tanner instead.</li>
            <li> This is a great self-tanner that fades naturally and does not streak when applied to exfolliated skin-- The reasonable cost is astounding because in the past I have up to $40 for a self- tanner that doesn&#x27;t even compare to the color and longevity of ths one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great color!  Good coverage!  People actually think I have a suntan!</li>
            <li> This worked better than any self tanner that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I immediately saw results and do not look orange at all. Very natural. It was easy to use and if I messed up I just wiped it off or rubbed it in better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years and LOVE it. It tans evenly &amp; looks very natural. The key is to REALLY make sure you have blended it well against your skin and you&#x27;re good to go with no streaks. I could do without the sparkly stuff but it&#x27;s not too apparant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a handful of sunless tanning lotions in the past, but none have produced an effect as quickly as L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze Tinted Self Tanning Lotion. I came back from vacation with a tan I wanted to keep, so I began applying this stuff not only where already tan, but also on my midriff and my back where my bathing suit had covered. Within four days there was a noticeable difference and I was extremely pleased.     I was a little confused reading the reviews by people who said it took too long to dry; my question for them is, how much are you using? I used only enough to spread evenly on my skin and rubbed it in thoroughly, and it dried instantly. It smells very nice (I usually spritz on some tropical-smelling perfume to match it) and I love the subtle glitter it lends to my skin. It makes me glow without being tacky.     The only downside I can think of is while it&#x27;s drying, it does feel sticky. But once dry my skin is smooth and feels almost like I&#x27;d used a very good moisturizer. My legs love the stuff.     DO wash your hands well after application, especially if you, like me, have calluses on your hands, they will absorb more color and turn orange. Also make sure you rub it in very thoroughly, to avoid streaks.    Great stuff, glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This self tanner does a pretty good job. I don&#x27;t really care for the \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot; it leaves however. But after you shower that pretty much goes away and you keep most the color. It&#x27;s hard to get it right on your hands to. That I don&#x27;t like. Make sure to wash your palms and fingernails to or they will be tan as well! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this self-tanning Lotion. If I had not read the ingredients list, I would have given it a 4 or even 5 star rating.  On the ingredients list in 3rd position, after Water/Aqua and denatured alcohol, stands d-hyroxyacetone. A controversial, highly regulated and restricted additive to self-tanners that contains toxins.  You can read about this chemical on the fda.gov website (under cosmetics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The FDA has restricted the use of DHA to external application. According to the CFR, \\&quot;externally applied\\&quot; cosmetics are those \\&quot;applied only to external parts of the body and not to the lips or any body surface covered by mucous membrane\\&quot;. The industry has not provided safety data to FDA in order for the agency to consider approving it for use on these exposure routes, including \\&quot;misting\\&quot; from tanning booths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, no color additive may be used in cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye unless the color additive is permitted specifically for such use (21 CFR 70.5a) DHA is not permitted for use in the area of the eye. The CFR defines \\&quot;area of the eye\\&quot; as under or just above the eye, eyebrow and eye ball.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What all of this boils down to is a wordy jungle one can get lost in. Fact remains that our skin is a highly absorbing organ and anything we rub into our skin, will end up in our blood stream. Whether we rub it around the eyebrow or onto our breasts and bellies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will stop using this product and search for an alternative. If anyone has found a good alternative, please let me know!</li>
            <li> Create a great natural looking tan!!  You have to make sure you put it on evenly to avoid streaks.  Don&#x27;t have a fake tan smell until about 8 hours later.  I use it before I go out or what not..  The tanner does go on with some sparkles.  I love this product  I only have to use two days in a row to get a nice deep tan which lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple bottles of this and it used to be my favorite self tanning product. It gives good, natural color that is noticeable after one application,  and gets better after every use. The bronzer also gives you good instant color and helps you to see if you&#x27;ve applied the product evenly or missed spots. However, the bronzer is also the reason I no longer use this product. It tends to rub off on clothes, even after you&#x27;ve let it dry. I was always careful to only wear dark clothing after applying it. But then I noticed the color rubbing off even days later, even after I&#x27;d showered. Also, because the color is so dark on the first application it makes mistakes pretty noticeable. Overall its a good product and I got lots of compliments on my tan after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self-tanner for 5 months now and I really love it. It&#x27;s a gel-like consistency and has a decent scent, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a slight bronze color, NOT orange like others I&#x27;ve tried. Also, it leaves a pretty sparkle similar to tiny glitter flakes, which is why I say it&#x27;s not for men :)&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: It can still streak or rub off a few minutes after you think it&#x27;s dry, so wait 5-10 minutes extra. Skin feels a little dry after applying, so I need to apply body lotion later (I use the bronzer in the morning and lotion at night).&lt;br /&gt;Positives: It shows up the day you put it on, so it&#x27;s easy to cover up streaks quickly.  It lasts about 5 days. It&#x27;s not crucial that you exfoliate so much that you hurt your skin...just a light exfoliant is needed beforehand. It doesn&#x27;t over-bronze the \\&quot;wrinkly\\&quot; parts of your body ilke knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Fyi, I&#x27;m light-skinned of Scandinavian descent and I burn easily in the sun, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember if i used this all over, but when i have used spray self tanners that streak, this product blends those problems away.</li>
            <li> very oily/greasy. First ingredient is mineral (baby) oil. The glimmer/ shimmer makes me itch too. Tan color is so-so-better choices are out there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much that I made a silly review video for it! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UXItKzep6ns</li>
            <li> Excellent. I now have a great colour all year round.</li>
            <li> amazing tanning, I recommend too</li>
            <li> I just bought this self-tanner on a whim at Wal-Mart. I took a shower and applied it as directed, lightly all over the body, like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I look like the glitter fairy puked ALL OVER ME. For like, twenty minutes. Like, the glitter fairy just turned 21 and downed fifteen Jello shots and five vodka-cranberries, and spewed eleven pounds of GLITTER all over me. It&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is seriously 70% ultra-fine glitter. I look ridiculous and I need to leave for work in thirty minutes. I can&#x27;t comment on the color development because I haven&#x27;t had the stuff on my skin long enough, but even if the color was fantastic, it still wouldn&#x27;t make up for the horrible glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; (I can never find \\&quot;light\\&quot; in any brand in any store).  I&#x27;d previously been happy with the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime in the orange container (it does a great job but it&#x27;s seriously stinky).     I am very pale.  I didn&#x27;t do much outdoorsy stuff last summer and I live in the north, so that&#x27;s almost two years without tanning - you can imagine how light I am.       I put this stuff on about an hour before going to bed.  I rubbed it in thoroughly and made sure that I could no longer see any of the tint.  As instructed, I washed my hands afterwards.     THE GOOD:    This stuff smells fantastic. It reminded me a bit of Christian Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;DUNE\\&quot; fragrance.  It&#x27;s tinted, so you can see where it&#x27;s going.  It has tiny shimmer sparkles in it, which make the skin on your body look amazing after application.    THE BAD/THE UGLY:    The first thing I noticed is that this product could NOT be used on your face or on your body in the daytime (unless you have a stage job in Vegas). There are so many sparkles in it, it almost looks like something a child would wear.      The product is very sticky even long after application.  Long after it dried, I went to bed. I usually lay on my side with my knees together.  I had the icky feeling (over and over) of my legs sticking together and having to unstick them. Not pleasant.     I woke up this morning and it was apparent (even more than the night before) this stuff shouldn&#x27;t have been used on my face. It was splotchy (unlike the other Sublime product I&#x27;d used previously) and looked like I&#x27;d spent a sweaty day wearing too-dark foundation.    My arms weren&#x27;t so bad. I could see a few streaks here and there. My hands?  OMG.  I shoudl&#x27;ve never washed them. I have nice color that stops at my wrists (it looks like I&#x27;m wearing gloves).    My legs are a mess to the point where I just went to the gym, glanced down at my legs, and got back in the car. My legs are blotchy and streaked (odd, since I&#x27;d rubbed and rubbed the stuff in until Icouldn&#x27;t see the tint).      There is no way I can be seen in bright light until this stuff wears off.  Yeah, it&#x27;s that bad.     This product may work well for people who have medium or light olive skin tones.  This stuff is NOT for very pale skin.  The contrast is just too great.     I may try it again but mix it in with a non-tannning lotion to dilute it and maybe on a small patch of skin that no one will see for a few days.       Other than that, I saw that they still sell the older Sublime product (in the orange bottle).  I may just give this one away and buy that one again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t come off onto clothes. I just found the shimmer a little bit too much for every day use - a special occasion product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanning products &amp; always come back to this one.  Others I&#x27;ve tried either result in skin irritation, blotching, or difficulty of application.  This product is easy to apply, as long as you immediately remove the excess, as is true of any self-tanning product, and results in good coloration &amp; tan simulation.  Also, it is important to wash your hands after application, as well as use a wet folded tissue, cotton ball, or make-up pad to remove any of the lotion from where your hair or beard meet skin, to avoid your hair in those areas turning orange!</li>
            <li> The product had glidder in it. It&#x27;s seems to be for women not men. I would not recommend to men.</li>
            <li> I saw this self tanner at shopper&#x27;s drug mart some time last week and decided to give it a try. My experience from using this self tanner was pretty good. I like the colour that it gives my skin. My skin tone is naturally fair and it doesn&#x27;t look orange on me. I don&#x27;t like the sparkles in it very much. Sometimes, I will apply self tanner before I go to work. I don&#x27;t like having sparkles all over me while I&#x27;m at work. Also, the smell of the lotion is bearable. Make sure to exfoliate really well before applying this lotion on your skin. Otherwise, your ankles, hands and elbows will look dirty and/or orange. The best advice I can give you while using this lotion is to WEAR GLOVES. I washed my hands really well after I applied the lotion and I woke up to orange palms and orange creases on my hands. I apply my self tanner three times a week and tada! I have a nice tan and glow. I like the lotion, but I might try another one when the bottle is finished. I Hope this was helpful for you!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m using this product in a non-traditional manner. I have a skin condition that leaves me with small patches of hypopigmentation on my face. I thought I&#x27;d try this product to darken these spots so they&#x27;re not as obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product advises that you shower and then apply this product all over. I use just a small bit and the scent is very strong and unpleasant; very chemical smelling in nature. I can&#x27;t imagine how overpowering it would be to use it all over like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bronze glow, it&#x27;s less \\&quot;subtle glow\\&quot; and more \\&quot;obnoxious sparkly\\&quot;. The first time I tried it, I ended up washing it off.  I&#x27;ve worn sparkly lotions for going out in the evening but this was way over the top.  Now I only apply the product when I&#x27;m not leaving the house for a few hours and then ash it off before going to bed (The product description was accurate in that it does dry quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain but I wash it off because of the smell.)</li>
            <li> just tried this morning for the first time. now i have sparkly glitter all over my skin, my clothes and my couch....NOT COOL L&#x27;oreal. plus the color is on the orange side.</li>
            <li> this product works very well and no streaks so I rated this very high on my shopping list in the future</li>
            <li> I have been using this product - and the medium for a few years.  I did a lot of research before deciding.  I have had a lot of compliments on how natural my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; looks.  It has never permanently stained my clothing. Ever.</li>
            <li> Bought it for her and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I Like the product. The service was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanner for over 10 years, and I always come back to this one. I feel like it gives me the best, most natural looking color. It has a tolerable scent, and it&#x27;s nice how it&#x27;s tinted so you can tell where you&#x27;ve already applied. This is the only sunless tanner I ever recommend!</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff and I&#x27;d buy it all the time. They have now added GLITTER/SHIMMER to it and I look ridiculous. Up close, my face almost looks wet in sunlight and my friends always ask me why I am sweating. Maybe I could use this ON STAGE for something theatrical - but for real life, they have ruined it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but if you go to a store it&#x27;s only $8.50. Don&#x27;t waste money buying it here!</li>
            <li> This is one of the better self tanning products I have used it gives a rich dark tan if desired or can use less often for a medium color tan the tan last a good amount of time so once you get to the desired shade you want you only have to use every few days or less to keep the color it doesn&#x27;t leave a streaky tan if put on evenly i get a lot of comments of how good my tan looks and that i must spend a lot of time outside LOL</li>
