    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see good results by the 28th day, the remainder of the tube will be returned for a refund under the manufacturer&#x27;s 30-day satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all my fellow racoon eye folks, \\&quot;Good Luck!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Now mind you I do not have raccoon eyes, as does the lovely model who wears the shoe polish so eloquently &amp; proudly displays.</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely too.</li>
            <li>It has it&#x27;s own all-in-one brush and twists up to pump more product into the bristles.  </li>
            <li>but it is nothing close to what drink more water and eating more healthy does.</li>
            <li>If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure,  </li>
            <li>have beautiful clear skin now (which is complemented all the time).  </li>
            <li>BUT MANY I FOUND DO SHOW THEIR FULL EFFECT IN 6 MONTHS OR MORE.</li>
            <li>It works and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The research on the ingredients seems strong and shows that the product helps work against under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Bremenn Research Labs, the manufacturer of Hylexin, claims on their website that their clinical trials produced fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think a good cover up stick is better.</li>
            <li>I do however, have a darker and more noticeable shade than most, giving the illusion I haven&#x27;t gotten a good nights rest in a few days..</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I returned this item to the store for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Much better product at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Go to a dermatologist and they will set you up with a plan that will give much faster and better results.</li>
            <li>So the question is, is that worth $95 to you?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the $95 worth and have had no results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like a hemroid creme...</li>
            <li>(the last few weeks was a very generous sample by my awesome Philosophy saleswoman).   </li>
            <li>After 8 weeks of consistent use, I see no change.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises and at $95 per tiny tube, it should do better.  </li>
            <li>After trying to discover a better way, i went to a dermatologist and they told me I need to drink more water something like 45 to 65 ounces a day, and that would help, and sure enough the water helped a lot more than this silly cream.</li>
            <li>First of all I took the initiative to look up the ingredients and found out basically that there are herbs and vitamins that are speculated to do what the manufacturer claims.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself as I checked out, but two weeks later I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>AM WILLING TO KEEP BUYING IT, AND USING IT, TO FIND OUT IF MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE OVER ALL SUCESS ARE CORRECT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I believe the only thing might reduce them is surgery if available.</li>
            <li>While it does seem to help, it is not as promising as one might consider paying a 100 bucks for.</li>
            <li>I have used this for two weeks, and do see a change, but cant really say it is the changes that I desire.  </li>
            <li>but she didn&#x27;t mention how much it costs.</li>
            <li>I feel there has been too much \\&quot;hype\\&quot; over this product.  </li>
            <li>It sounds to me like there really isn&#x27;t any research.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them since high school</li>
            <li>NOT MUCH WORKS IN 2 WEEKS, IN THE OVER ALL ANTI-AGEING PRODUCTS AREA THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY.</li>
            <li>The advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag but somehow I believed this just might work.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn&#x27;t the first to ask for my money back</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for reducing dark circles under my eyes and so far nothing works.</li>
            <li>It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that markets this useless cream</li>
            <li>But when I was nearly 28, I started using Philosophy face products (oxygen peel, microdelivery peel, purity face wash,</li>
            <li>I am Italian and Greek and there isn&#x27;t anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by.  </li>
            <li>The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product.  </li>
            <li>all the other sufferers out there like me with dark circles, this products helps but you will still be able to see them, they are just not as dark, about one shade (or perhaps two if you are lucky) lighter.</li>
            <li>But personally I would of rather blow a hundred dollars on a new pair of shoes...</li>
            <li>This product appears to be built on sound scientific data (at least based with the homeopathic scrutiny).  </li>
            <li>To boot, when I was almost completely clear, I added use of something called Finacea (prescription only) and now I don&#x27;t remember what acne ever was.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed no difference at all, my dark circle is still the first thing I see</li>
            <li>I have noticed a definite improvement in the color under my eyes, and a marked decrease in puffiness.  </li>
            <li>6 MONTHS OF USE TO SEE THE COMPLETE RESTOREATION IN THE VESSELS STRENGTH AND ITS OVERALL EFFECT.  </li>
            <li>This product is a quick fix thing and only lasted a few hours (up to 3).  </li>
            <li>(that is to say if one is really paying close attention to this other than myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed; but I&#x27;m happy there are reviewers who like the product.</li>
            <li>the sounds like it will really get rid of the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I used an entire tube of this product and my dark circles are EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>So far, I THINK I see a minor improvement in the darkness under my eyes</li>
            <li>and I thought ok let me give it a try, since the ad says \\&quot;helps reduce SERIOUS dark</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The research on the ingredients seems strong and shows that the product helps work against under eye puffiness. I am not sure how it is meant to work against dark circles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would suggest looking at the PRESCRIBEDsolutions&#x27; eye serum instead. Available only from doctors, it has the same anti-puffiness complex but it also uses Vitamin K, Arnica and other ingredients so that the overall benefits of using are broader.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for reducing dark circles under my eyes and so far nothing works. I am 33 and i really suffer from serious panda like dark circles. I heard from my sisters about Hylexin and I thought ok let me give it a try, since the ad says \\&quot;helps reduce SERIOUS dark circles\\&quot;. I have been using it for over a month, and nothing, no improvement at all. Besides it is kinda expensive too. One word, save your time and money. I believe the only thing might reduce them is surgery if available.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for over 3 weeks, twice a day, just as the instruction suggests.  I have noticed no difference at all, my dark circle is still the first thing I see whenev I look into the mirror.  It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used Hylexin almost every day for several weeks.  I think it has worked slightly, but I worry that&#x27;s in my head.  So I will update this review when I finish my tube, which I use twice daily now (the last few weeks was a very generous sample by my awesome Philosophy saleswoman).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apologies for the tangent, but I have to share (since I&#x27;m writing this anyway) that I developed AWFUL adult acne when I turned 26; my chin actually had purple spots all over it from having so many zits in a row, and my self esteem (sad to say) did drop.  I tried everything, and had a few breakdowns.  But when I was nearly 28, I started using Philosophy face products (oxygen peel, microdelivery peel, purity face wash, hope in a jar, etc.) and I actually (freakin&#x27;!) have beautiful clear skin now (which is complemented all the time).  To boot, when I was almost completely clear, I added use of something called Finacea (prescription only) and now I don&#x27;t remember what acne ever was.  I could be a face model.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will write again in a few months about my Hylexin progress.</li>
            <li> Why are companies allowed to lie to people this way? I used an entire tube of this product and my dark circles are EXACTLY the same. DO NOT buy this product. These are con artists.</li>
            <li> After 8 weeks of consistent use, I see no change. My dark circles are a family trait, and I emailed the company before purchase to ask if it worked for inherited dark circles. The respondent assured me it worked for ANY dark circles.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.  I do notice a difference, but as with any cosmetic application, short of surgery, it is a subtle change.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To all the other sufferers out there like me with dark circles, this products helps but you will still be able to see them, they are just not as dark, about one shade (or perhaps two if you are lucky) lighter. So the question is, is that worth $95 to you?  Personally, I think a good cover up stick is better. Try Clarins \\&quot;Instant Light\\&quot; instead.  It works and is easy to apply.  Guys, it is also not so \\&quot;girlish\\&quot; and looks like a pencil.  You know you secretly use your wife&#x27;s, girl friends, or whatever anyway. It has it&#x27;s own all-in-one brush and twists up to pump more product into the bristles.  It blends in nicely too.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube two weeks ago and have been applying it religiously twice daily since then.  So far, I THINK I see a minor improvement in the darkness under my eyes but my wife says she doesn&#x27;t see any improvement.  \\&quot;Stick with it,\\&quot; she says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see a definite improvement in the puffiness, however.  The \\&quot;bags\\&quot; are virtually gone.  I can see and \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know already I will not be buying another tube whether it works or not.  At $95 (plus tax or shipping), it&#x27;s not really the cure-all it claims to be.  If I don&#x27;t see good results by the 28th day, the remainder of the tube will be returned for a refund under the manufacturer&#x27;s 30-day satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I returned this item to the store for a full refund.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises and at $95 per tiny tube, it should do better.  If I could, I would reduce my rating from 3 stars to just 1.</li>
            <li> this is another scam and bogus product from the Basic Research company who is always being sued</li>
            <li> This product is a quick fix thing and only lasted a few hours (up to 3).  It&#x27;s very much like a hemroid creme...but for your eyes and needs constant reapplication.  I&#x27;d only use it for photo shoots when you need to look \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with Mr. Racoon Eye&#x27;s review.  I applied the product religiously twice a day as instructed.  I do not have a problem with bags only dark circles. After 30 days with no improvement, I returned it.  I&#x27;ll stick with Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Eye Wish.  Much better product at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> And I was fooled.  When I read about it in a magazine, I thought Finally, something the sounds like it will really get rid of the dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve had them since high school and they just seem to get worse as I get older.  I&#x27;m into my third week of applying the cream religiously with no visible change.  I&#x27;ll try to return the rest of the tube to Macy&#x27;s for a refund (wish me luck).</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for two weeks.  I have noticed a definite improvement in the color under my eyes, and a marked decrease in puffiness.  I don&#x27;t know why it is working for me, but it seems to be. . .Will I buy another tube when this one is gone?  I&#x27;m not sure. Let&#x27;s see how it works when fall pollen season kicks in, and the dark allergy-eyes circles appear.</li>
            <li> Hylexin did not work for me. I still have dark circles under my eyes and now I am $95 poorer. Maybe my dark circles weren&#x27;t SERIOUS enough...</li>
            <li> Hylexin states that it is for serious black circles under the eye. While it does seem to help, it is not as promising as one might consider paying a 100 bucks for. After trying to discover a better way, i went to a dermatologist and they told me I need to drink more water something like 45 to 65 ounces a day, and that would help, and sure enough the water helped a lot more than this silly cream. Look the creme works but it is nothing close to what drink more water and eating more healthy does. Go to a dermatologist and they will set you up with a plan that will give much faster and better results. But all in all this product is not that bad and more a less an expensive cosmetic creme, worth trying, but won&#x27;t really change anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, one to two times a day as the instructions states. A small amount is needed per eye (about the size of a small pea). Well the puffiness is not as severe, although a nice cold pack mask left of the face in the morning for about 5-8 minutes will do the same job for about $10.00, and it&#x27;s re-usable. As for the reduced dark circles... well there is a slight (and I do mean slight) noticeable difference in the shade. I would imagine it would take a few months and about 3-4 tubes @ $100 a piece to possibly see a truly noticeable difference. Now mind you I do not have raccoon eyes, as does the lovely model who wears the shoe polish so eloquently &amp; proudly displays. I do however, have a darker and more noticeable shade than most, giving the illusion I haven&#x27;t gotten a good nights rest in a few days.. (that is to say if one is really paying close attention to this other than myself. Once I finish the current tube I am on, I will then determine if further treatment is necessary if my vanity continues to get in the way.</li>
            <li> First of all I took the initiative to look up the ingredients and found out basically that there are herbs and vitamins that are speculated to do what the manufacturer claims. For example \\&quot;gynostemma pentaphyllum\\&quot; is ginger that has some blood vessels efects as so does Hesperidin(found in citrus peels) which is the supposed vessel protector to keep vessels from leaking. I have used this for two weeks, and do see a change, but cant really say it is the changes that I desire.  This product appears to be built on sound scientific data (at least based with the homeopathic scrutiny).  But personally I would of rather blow a hundred dollars on a new pair of shoes...</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t tried this Hylexin stuff but I picked up a tube of Neutrogena&#x27;s Radiance Boost Eye Cream at Walmart for $11. \\&quot;How expensive!\\&quot; I thought to myself as I checked out, but two weeks later I&#x27;m glad I found it. It&#x27;s slowly making a difference. My mom had told me about Hylexin but she didn&#x27;t mention how much it costs. Now I know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To all my fellow racoon eye folks, \\&quot;Good Luck!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> WORKS!!! I CAN SEE A DIFFERANCE , BUT I FEEL IT MAY TAKE AS LONG AS 6 MONTHS OF USE TO SEE THE COMPLETE RESTOREATION IN THE VESSELS STRENGTH AND ITS OVERALL EFFECT.  &lt;br /&gt;I AM WILLING TO KEEP BUYING IT, AND USING IT, TO FIND OUT IF MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE OVER ALL SUCESS ARE CORRECT. &lt;br /&gt; NOT MUCH WORKS IN 2 WEEKS, IN THE OVER ALL ANTI-AGEING PRODUCTS AREA THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY. BUT MANY I FOUND DO SHOW THEIR FULL EFFECT IN 6 MONTHS OR MORE. &lt;br /&gt; I AM 52 AND LOOK 35 TO 38, AND HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD AT IT SINCE I WAS 43. I HAVE NARROWED WHAT WORKS TO A SCIENCE, AND THIS DOES.</li>
            <li> The advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag but somehow I believed this just might work.  It doesn&#x27;t and it angers me to know I fell for the hype.  The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product.  It isn&#x27;t.  I am Italian and Greek and there isn&#x27;t anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by.  If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep.  It they&#x27;re from allergies, take Claritin but don&#x27;t throw away $100.00 plus  on this tube of nothing.  It is not worth the money and can&#x27;t do what is promised.  Please, just judge this product by the advertising picture.  It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that markets this useless cream is called \\&quot;Basic Research.\\&quot;  Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage.  Macy&#x27;s and Amazon should immediately pull this item.  To do less would ruin the credibility of both companies, currently held in high regard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy&#x27;s.  This isn&#x27;t mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn&#x27;t the first to ask for my money back and I am sure,  won&#x27;t be the last. The fact they took it back locally speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...save your money and don&#x27;t fall for this one..it just doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> I feel there has been too much \\&quot;hype\\&quot; over this product.  I&#x27;ve used the $95 worth and have had no results.  I&#x27;m disappointed; but I&#x27;m happy there are reviewers who like the product.</li>
            <li> Bremenn Research Labs, the manufacturer of Hylexin, claims on their website that their clinical trials produced fabulous results. I called the company and asked to see the research. I was told that the research is proprietary and can&#x27;t be shared with the public. It sounds to me like there really isn&#x27;t any research. I&#x27;d like to know the truth about this product.</li>
            <li> Terrific!  Another overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product from the folks who brought us the other overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product known as Stri-Vectin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Give me a break! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your dough, folks!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week and have seen NO IMPROVEMENT.  That&#x27;s acceptable if it cost $5.00 - but at $95.00 a tube this is ridiculous.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, now I have dark circles AND out a hundred bucks!</li>
