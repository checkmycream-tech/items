            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>but some scents aren&#x27;t for me, it smells good on my daughter.</li>
            <li>You would have to spritz it on your clothing rather than skin to get a good wear time.  </li>
            <li>It smells good to me</li>
            <li>But after smelling its impression( that I also loved) I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>

            <li>Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
            <li>i still love it though!</li>
            <li>Love Katy Perry Lots!</li>
            <li>Kudos to Katy Perry for designing not only a beautiful statuesque perfume bottle but a superb fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and delicious, very sweet.</li>
            <li>I liked the perfume, the smell was nice.  </li>
            <li>I smelled this perfume at a nearby store and really liked it</li>
            <li>She did take a sliht smell and said it seemed nice.</li>
            <li>and it also smells really nice</li>
            <li>Not my kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I really liked the bottle that this came in</li>
            <li>it has a nice smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of citric&lt;</li>
            <li>smells really good and the bottle is supper cute</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that the celebrity endorsed perfumes (Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Halle Berry, Beyonce etc) are all wonderful scents but the staying power is a bit short compared to say, Clinique Happy Heart or Chanel.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, it is not a scent that I can wear a lot though.</li>
            <li>Pretty and smell really nice!!</li>
            <li>Great for those who like a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Very sweet!</li>
            <li>The perfume smells best about 1/2 hour after application; warm, creamy soft vanilla.</li>
            <li>its kind of floral-y and it smells really sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Suitable for day or evening wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 and I feel it is more of a mid/late 20s kind of scent.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase- a true bargain!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get something marketed by a popstar, but this is a great smelling purfume, its fresh and sophisticated</li>
            <li>The bottle for this perfume is adorable and it&#x27;s a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li>A bit strong but smells nice.</li>
            <li>I believe that it offers very good value for money given the smell, volume and price.</li>
            <li>Meow by Katy Perry is better.</li>
            <li>I love this on my girl.</li>
            <li>The bottle is soooo flipping cute that I almost can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>On my skin it smells mostly fruity, powdery.</li>
            <li>The scent does change through the day which is interesting.</li>
            <li>I like more what it smells like hours after having it on</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>This scent is sultry,sexy,sinful,sassy and more Your man will love it,and so will others.</li>
            <li>I simply love it</li>
            <li>i love Katy Perry</li>
            <li>I wish men would comment more on womens perfumes, their reviews and comments are interesting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a spring and summer sent ,but it can be worn any season if you wish.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Yup that is what you will being saying  Love the smell of Purr and the kitty</li>
            <li>is so adorable</li>
            <li>it is quite cheap when you buy in amazon!  </li>
            <li>This is my girlfriends favorite, she was out</li>
            <li>, I love the smell of it on her</li>
            <li>I. LOVE.</li>
            <li>so give it a try  :)</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>but once it settles it smells better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I ordered both scents and Katy perry meow is much better .</li>
            <li>bottle is really cute though</li>
            <li>love cat love cats</li>
            <li>May not be authentic.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely scent</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>The fragrance delivers lovely candyish vibes with some floral, vanilla and sandalwood notes as it settles.</li>
            <li>I would spray even more, on the skin and clothes, thinking that it would help the fragrance to stay longer.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it</li>
            <li>and I also love it.  </li>
            <li>Meow is more to my tastes.</li>
            <li>I am not saying that the scent is for everyone, just mentioning that I love it.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the online Costco of the world :)</li>
            <li>After wearing for awhile it deepens and becomes even more exotic.</li>
            <li>some of those are better.</li>
            <li>Cute gift for a cat-loving pre-teen or teenager, however.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just my opinion, anyone can wear it :)</li>
            <li>I see everyone&#x27;s saying meow smells better</li>
            <li>I totally love this perfume</li>
            <li>AND WHAT WOMAN DON;T LOVE CATS</li>
            <li>My grand daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li>I now keep it in the cabinet without the top on it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>i love perfume</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This adorable kitty is all glass (plastic head) of purple/blueish hue and around the neck, a metal collar.</li>
            <li>I gave the perfume as a gift, and they gave it raves they really love it</li>
            <li>Love the cute bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and I also love meow as well.</li>
            <li>The cute bottle got my attention</li>
            <li>So hey, I guess I ordered a gift for someone? :)</li>
            <li>This is a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It is much more of a night fragrance over meow.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>My friends love it too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to try new things new fragrances, you may be surprised on which ones you like &lt;3 (( Also snooki&#x27;s perfume is awesome if you like sweet perfumes like this one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very original.</li>
            <li>have to say I loved the scent very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments, and the bottle is soooooo super cute!</li>
            <li>it smells amazing and the bottle is super cute for cat lovers lime myself.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my teenager niece as a Christmas gift it smells so nice and sweet</li>
            <li>Got it for granddaughter, she loved it and Mom approved of gentle essence!</li>
            <li>When you first spray it on, the scent is strong but pleasant (orange blossom).</li>
            <li>Believe me this site is worth checking out!!</li>
            <li>Light scent, perfect for my teen Granddaughter!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for teenagers and young women and can be worn anywhere.</li>
            <li>It really smells good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, rich scent that&#x27;s not too sweet or too overpowering.</li>
            <li>all excellent, and I received the product in Venezuela, waiting times were set, many thanks, recommended 100%, thanks, success and blessings.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this perfume at first</li>
            <li>This product has a great smell and is her favorite present.</li>
            <li>,  the charm already came off and the head comes off so easily</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very well made and very cute.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell it has a sweet floral, citrus, grape sent to me.</li>
            <li>The smell kind of reminded me of potpourri at first</li>
            <li>Simply sweet, sexy and not too over-powering.</li>
            <li>I love rich, delicious scents that are not cloying or too heavy.</li>
            <li>Purr is my favorite though because it has a sharpness to it, not as light and sweet as Meow comes off.  </li>
            <li>, it seems to smell more fruity when u first spray it on, then when it dries it smells more floral.</li>
            <li>there aren&#x27;t many perfumes that I like, but wow this smells wonderful warm and fresh at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more towards a person who likes light not to sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Christmas just trying to shop and didn&#x27;t take the time to read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>but luckily they were able to find it.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is large, has some nice weight to it and easily contours to your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You dont need to put on much and it lasts for most of the day!</li>
            <li>Purr is the purrfect choice for anyone looking for something that smells sexy, appealing and fun but doesn&#x27;t offend the nose by being too cloyingly sweet or over-powering.</li>
            <li>Smell a bit strong when you first apply it, but about 5 minutes later, the aroma is the perfect mix of sweet and sultry.</li>
            <li>So a huge part of me just can&#x27;t justify it.</li>
            <li>For my liking it just smells like candy, very girly fragrance, not for a grown up woman, and the smell itself is kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice sent but wears out fast.  </li>
            <li>then the biggest bottle of it available.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I received this as a gift</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great and of coarse my wife loves the bottle.</li>
            <li>Wish it could last longer but its a great smell</li>
            <li>(I paid $26 with shipping for a 3.4oz), and the fantastic display value of the bottle itself...</li>
            <li>and I love it for when i want something super sweet</li>
            <li>Smells sweet not floral at all, it&#x27;s a bit strong</li>
            <li>Something about Purr provides a unique edginess, in comparison to Meow, making it a seemingly stronger fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel that the scent is original at all.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and it smells great once this bottle is gone</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I like katy perry  , love cats, and the bottle is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love, love, love the initial scent of Katy Perry!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is so cute and the package come exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It is a very sexy mature scent in my opinion and might not be in my age range.</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>I love how sweet and gentle this perfume smells!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light &amp; clean and really pretty!  </li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, pretty and large for the money.</li>
            <li>They tend to fade fast, and appear to be mostly about marketing hype.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>I prefer fruity, sweet fragrances.  </li>
            <li>it smells too sweet for me&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Ordered this on a whim as I recently bought and surprisingly loved &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27; (also by Katy Perry).</li>
            <li>not too sweet, and i think this would work for all ages.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to pick this out of a line up of scents.  </li>
            <li>Even though I wasn&#x27;t over the moon about the perfume itself, it does smell good and is totally wearable.  </li>
            <li>bought as a birthday present for my wife,she loved it.</li>
            <li>The only thing to complain about is the bottle has a ding on the bottom of it and looks a bit scraped but good thing</li>
            <li>Lovely parfume fast shipping</li>
            <li>Sweet but not too sweet</li>
            <li>that much is true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent just wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>scent is wonderful, but the formula needs serious tweaking...</li>
            <li>I was first attracted by the adorable cat perfume bottle - I really, really wanted it!</li>
            <li>It was packaged and sealed as if I bought it from ULTA, and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>I GOT LUCKY GIVING THIS TO MY WIFE</li>
            <li>The perfume is light and crisp, not cloying or over-powerful.</li>
            <li>and since it was so cheap i didn&#x27;t care to check it out in the store first.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend bought me two more bottle for an early valentines gift and I was so excited.</li>
            <li>The bottles super cute and the scent is very light, not too strong or heavy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very sweet/light and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, not to strong.</li>
            <li>This seller&#x27;s product is authentic and a larger bottle for a cheaper price than I paid years ago when I first fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Just wish I got it the first time I ordered the darn thing!  </li>
            <li>Bottle was less than the price of a 1 oz in the store, so fabulous bargain!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light on the sandalwood and musk, and just gives enough to linger lightly.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing,</li>
            <li>but it gives me a headache because it just kind of stays in a cloud around your body to where only YOU can smell it and others</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more mature than midnight fantasy though, the way the fragrance develops and smells.</li>
            <li>I will likely order Katy Perry&#x27;s Meow as well, just because I am so thrilled with the value and the bottle...and it may turn out</li>
            <li>A really good deal compared to what I would&#x27;ve spent at a department store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice perfume for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle of perfume for the price, compared to most others and the floral, slightly citrusy scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon with a special discount (49.99) for the large 3.4 ounce bottle, which was cheaper than the price at the store (55.00 for the 1.7 ounce bottle).  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, just right.  </li>
            <li>Purr has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to describe a scent, but I&#x27;d say this is a \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; fruity as opposed to the bubble gum fruity of stuff like Love&#x27;s Berry Sweet (which I also wear).  </li>
            <li>It was nice in that the scent lasted a long time</li>
            <li>The perfume has a great scent just the right amount of sweetness and lasting power is terrific.</li>
            <li>, if you have a 20 - 30 year old wife/girlfriend/sister, this will probably be a good present for them.</li>
            <li>if it lasted for more then a few hours I would definately buy more</li>
            <li>Lucky the bottle was not broken</li>
            <li>and it is really a big volume for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I have a large collection of fragrances and this may be my new super sweet fave.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the item arrived!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>My little sister loved it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent several years ago.</li>
            <li>With that said, Purr is an absolute winner!</li>
            <li>However, based off reviews it seemed like exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My fiance loves it on me as well :) Also, shipping only took a week even though I&#x27;m overseas</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than meow.</li>
            <li>The order was received on time and exactly as I imagined.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is so cute and much bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The lasting power is OKAY..</li>
            <li>The first time I came across it in Marie Claire, I was intrigued that Katy Perry was using it herself.</li>
            <li>The scent is very feminine, very fruity, not too sweet at all.</li>
            <li>She wears it daily because everyone always asks her what she&#x27;s wearing, they love it too.  </li>
            <li>It was the first thing I picked up.  </li>
            <li>; (Thanks guys!)</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous ordering this without smelling it first, but after reading through the reviews I decided I&#x27;d go for it.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for its not for me</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying both fragrances again! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The bottle is really pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok a little strong at first</li>
            <li>Katy Perry&#x27;s other perfume &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; however is AMAZING..</li>
            <li>I love layered fragrances, I cannot stand the flat, one-note fits all scents.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I do agree scent seems to not last as long - but for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about the scents I wear, especially since my family members are allergic to most perfumes out there, but this one just works with me.</li>
            <li>so I decided to read the reviews, which were mostly positive.</li>
            <li>But within about three hours the perfume is mild and completely gone.</li>
            <li>For the price and how large it is?</li>
            <li>You will certainly feel like the &#x27;cat&#x27;s meow&#x27;</li>
            <li>I am not sure how my daughter feels about the perfume, but she was thrilled with such a cute bottle.</li>
            <li>fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>and I suppose support for Katy haha</li>
            <li>So fast that I sometimes I spray it on before bed</li>
            <li>And it was very well packaged</li>
            <li>, I even dropped the box accidentally when I got home and was afraid I&#x27;d damaged it, but to my relief, it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>So sit back and enjoy all the compliments you get with this one ladies.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, and very girly.</li>
            <li>Smells just like the one you can find at Macy&#x27;s, but this one is sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>..also shipping was fast...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>, I really like the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes it, and so do I.  </li>
            <li>The presentation, design and quality of the product is very impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this same fragrance free from the link below:https://www.listia.com</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like purr as much as I do meow</li>
            <li>much to our surprise, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping time was reasonable.</li>
            <li>, this was a reasonably priced option</li>
            <li>Purr is a concoction of peach nectar, forbidden apple, a distinct floral bouquet of jasmine blossom, Bulgarian rose, and vanilla orchid, with slowly revealing accents of creamy sandalwood and musk.</li>
            <li>This arrived kind of slow but worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>When I used the perfume, I smelled gardenia, not peach, as many other people said in their reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised to say I like it very much even though I am a guy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very powerful, intense, sweet, fruity and feminine smell that is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li>This smell could be worn on a young adult (which I believe the bottle is marketed for), but it is a scent sophisticated enough for women of any age.</li>
            <li>I remember playing with cheap perfumes when I was younger and this brought me right back to those memories.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging and adorable bottle, but would not buy again and unable to return it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for yourself or to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>but the price was way too high for my taste.  </li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend this to anyone considering this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for women and girls of any age .  </li>
            <li>Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr starts off with a peach nectar and apple scent, in a high end type of way.</li>
            <li>However after about an hour, it settles into a distinct but subtle scent (mostly vanilla).</li>
            <li>This perfume is one of those rare ones that actually appeal to me, because it is one of the sweetest perfumes, and when you put it on for a date, he is going to notice and compliment you!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li>All pretty much the same and</li>
            <li>Like other people have said though, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as most other perfumes do, but the trade off is worth it because I love when she wears it.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>she cant sing live but this is one hell of a perfume.</li>
            <li>The bottle is even better in person than online, and it is much bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>scent is fantastic - the mid and under-tones leave a lasting impression.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my very young daughter, I like it</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to the world of perfumes or if you&#x27;re a seasoned veteran when it comes to this stuff</li>
            <li>I paid for a pretty bottle with a generic scent...</li>
            <li>Apparently, it&#x27;s different for everyone, because other reviewers love it and say it lasts for them.</li>
            <li>I do know cheaper perfumes fade quickly, but I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that from this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The big kitty head top makes it a little tip-prone.</li>
            <li>Plus, unlike other fruity splashes that fade away in less than 10 minutes, this has lasted over 3 hours and still has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a generic smell to drug store perfumes that this is very close to.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it seems that it is for young girls.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this perfume for a young adult women maybe around 18 - 25 or so.</li>
            <li>At least I was able to return it.  </li>
            <li>We got this for our 23 yr old daughter&#x27;s birthday gift.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a very decent/nice scent.</li>
            <li>Me liking the scent so much is probably why it took me a while to realize that the scent doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li>THis was a gift for my 8 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>I was stunned to find the 3.4oz bottle for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>To me personally, it was very powdery</li>
            <li>The top doesnt stay on the bottle and the scent, it doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD perfume, though I did find it to be a bit vanilla-y and floral for my tastes even though vanilla was fairly far down on the list of notes.  </li>
            <li>I have been through most of the celebrity perfumes, but have found that they usually come up short.</li>
            <li>I just ordered and the package is soo pretty and such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing is that the fragrance could last a little longer, but I guess that can be fixed by taking it with you if you have a really long day ahead and want to keep smelling nice till the end of it :)</li>
            <li>If you like soft sweet scents this is it, the only downs side is that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>The bottle is big, solid, heavy and adorable.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear chanel perfume and gucci, wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li>to a site that show&#x27;s you scents similar to what you normally wear or would like to wear</li>
            <li>It certainly does not live to the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; claim on the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty feminine scent but also has a little vanilla muskiness to it.</li>
            <li>and it last pretty long..</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is original KP scent.</li>
            <li>It too, like Meow, is a long-lasting perfume that I can still smell on my wrists at night after only two sprits in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li>It sits very close to the skin, projection is minimal.</li>
            <li>REALLY WISH AMAZON would post that this item is non-returnable in much larger print closer to other information.  </li>
            <li>a little spritz on your wrists and neck will be enough to last through the day and right into the</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the fruity smell, as that&#x27;s the typical perfumes I&#x27;m attracted to, but didn&#x27;t smell that at all.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too fruity, too flowery, or too musky, but has a perfect blend of each.</li>

            <li> My husband gave me the Purr gift set for Christmas, said he loved it in the store.  </li>

            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> but some scents aren&#x27;t for me, it smells good on my daughter.</li>
            <li> You would have to spritz it on your clothing rather than skin to get a good wear time.  </li>
            <li> It smells good to me</li>
            <li> But after smelling its impression( that I also loved) I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>

            <li> I love the smell and it is great to wear for both day and night.</li>

            <li> Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> i still love it though!</li>
            <li> Love Katy Perry Lots!</li>
            <li> Kudos to Katy Perry for designing not only a beautiful statuesque perfume bottle but a superb fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and delicious, very sweet.</li>
            <li> I liked the perfume, the smell was nice.  </li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume at a nearby store and really liked it</li>
            <li> She did take a sliht smell and said it seemed nice.</li>
            <li> and it also smells really nice</li>
            <li> Not my kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I really liked the bottle that this came in</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of citric&lt;</li>
            <li> smells really good and the bottle is supper cute</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that the celebrity endorsed perfumes (Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Halle Berry, Beyonce etc) are all wonderful scents but the staying power is a bit short compared to say, Clinique Happy Heart or Chanel.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, it is not a scent that I can wear a lot though.</li>
            <li> Pretty and smell really nice!!</li>
            <li> Great for those who like a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Very sweet!</li>
            <li> The perfume smells best about 1/2 hour after application; warm, creamy soft vanilla.</li>
            <li> its kind of floral-y and it smells really sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Suitable for day or evening wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I feel it is more of a mid/late 20s kind of scent.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase- a true bargain!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get something marketed by a popstar, but this is a great smelling purfume, its fresh and sophisticated</li>
            <li> The bottle for this perfume is adorable and it&#x27;s a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li> A bit strong but smells nice.</li>
            <li> I believe that it offers very good value for money given the smell, volume and price.</li>
            <li> Meow by Katy Perry is better.</li>
            <li> I love this on my girl.</li>
            <li> The bottle is soooo flipping cute that I almost can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> On my skin it smells mostly fruity, powdery.</li>
            <li> The scent does change through the day which is interesting.</li>
            <li> I like more what it smells like hours after having it on</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> This scent is sultry,sexy,sinful,sassy and more Your man will love it,and so will others.</li>
            <li> I simply love it</li>
            <li> i love Katy Perry</li>
            <li> I wish men would comment more on womens perfumes, their reviews and comments are interesting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a spring and summer sent ,but it can be worn any season if you wish.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Yup that is what you will being saying  Love the smell of Purr and the kitty</li>
            <li> is so adorable</li>
            <li> it is quite cheap when you buy in amazon!  </li>
            <li> This is my girlfriends favorite, she was out</li>
            <li> , I love the smell of it on her</li>
            <li> I. LOVE.</li>
            <li> so give it a try  :)</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> i love this.</li>
            <li> but once it settles it smells better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I ordered both scents and Katy perry meow is much better .</li>
            <li> bottle is really cute though</li>
            <li> love cat love cats</li>
            <li> May not be authentic.  </li>
            <li> It is a lovely scent</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> The fragrance delivers lovely candyish vibes with some floral, vanilla and sandalwood notes as it settles.</li>
            <li> I would spray even more, on the skin and clothes, thinking that it would help the fragrance to stay longer.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> and I also love it.  </li>
            <li> Meow is more to my tastes.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that the scent is for everyone, just mentioning that I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the online Costco of the world :)</li>
            <li> After wearing for awhile it deepens and becomes even more exotic.</li>
            <li> some of those are better.</li>
            <li> Cute gift for a cat-loving pre-teen or teenager, however.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just my opinion, anyone can wear it :)</li>
            <li> I see everyone&#x27;s saying meow smells better</li>
            <li> I totally love this perfume</li>
            <li> AND WHAT WOMAN DON;T LOVE CATS</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li> I now keep it in the cabinet without the top on it.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> i love perfume</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This adorable kitty is all glass (plastic head) of purple/blueish hue and around the neck, a metal collar.</li>
            <li> I gave the perfume as a gift, and they gave it raves they really love it</li>
            <li> Love the cute bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> and I also love meow as well.</li>
            <li> The cute bottle got my attention</li>
            <li> So hey, I guess I ordered a gift for someone? :)</li>
            <li> This is a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> It is much more of a night fragrance over meow.</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> My friends love it too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to try new things new fragrances, you may be surprised on which ones you like &lt;3 (( Also snooki&#x27;s perfume is awesome if you like sweet perfumes like this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very original.</li>
            <li> have to say I loved the scent very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments, and the bottle is soooooo super cute!</li>
            <li> it smells amazing and the bottle is super cute for cat lovers lime myself.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenager niece as a Christmas gift it smells so nice and sweet</li>
            <li> Got it for granddaughter, she loved it and Mom approved of gentle essence!</li>
            <li> When you first spray it on, the scent is strong but pleasant (orange blossom).</li>
            <li> Believe me this site is worth checking out!!</li>
            <li> Light scent, perfect for my teen Granddaughter!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for teenagers and young women and can be worn anywhere.</li>
            <li> It really smells good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, rich scent that&#x27;s not too sweet or too overpowering.</li>
            <li> all excellent, and I received the product in Venezuela, waiting times were set, many thanks, recommended 100%, thanks, success and blessings.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfume at first</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell and is her favorite present.</li>
            <li> ,  the charm already came off and the head comes off so easily</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very well made and very cute.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell it has a sweet floral, citrus, grape sent to me.</li>
            <li> The smell kind of reminded me of potpourri at first</li>
            <li> Simply sweet, sexy and not too over-powering.</li>
            <li> I love rich, delicious scents that are not cloying or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Purr is my favorite though because it has a sharpness to it, not as light and sweet as Meow comes off.  </li>
            <li> , it seems to smell more fruity when u first spray it on, then when it dries it smells more floral.</li>
            <li> there aren&#x27;t many perfumes that I like, but wow this smells wonderful warm and fresh at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Everything was fine.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more towards a person who likes light not to sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Christmas just trying to shop and didn&#x27;t take the time to read the fine print.  </li>
            <li> but luckily they were able to find it.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is large, has some nice weight to it and easily contours to your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You dont need to put on much and it lasts for most of the day!</li>
            <li> Purr is the purrfect choice for anyone looking for something that smells sexy, appealing and fun but doesn&#x27;t offend the nose by being too cloyingly sweet or over-powering.</li>
            <li> Smell a bit strong when you first apply it, but about 5 minutes later, the aroma is the perfect mix of sweet and sultry.</li>
            <li> So a huge part of me just can&#x27;t justify it.</li>
            <li> For my liking it just smells like candy, very girly fragrance, not for a grown up woman, and the smell itself is kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice sent but wears out fast.  </li>
            <li> then the biggest bottle of it available.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I received this as a gift</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and of coarse my wife loves the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wish it could last longer but its a great smell</li>
            <li> (I paid $26 with shipping for a 3.4oz), and the fantastic display value of the bottle itself...</li>
            <li> and I love it for when i want something super sweet</li>
            <li> Smells sweet not floral at all, it&#x27;s a bit strong</li>
            <li> Something about Purr provides a unique edginess, in comparison to Meow, making it a seemingly stronger fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about this.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel that the scent is original at all.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it smells great once this bottle is gone</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I like katy perry  , love cats, and the bottle is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love, love, love the initial scent of Katy Perry!!</li>
            <li> The bottle is so cute and the package come exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It is a very sexy mature scent in my opinion and might not be in my age range.</li>
            <li> I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li> I love how sweet and gentle this perfume smells!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light &amp; clean and really pretty!  </li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, pretty and large for the money.</li>
            <li> They tend to fade fast, and appear to be mostly about marketing hype.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> I prefer fruity, sweet fragrances.  </li>
            <li> it smells too sweet for me&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Ordered this on a whim as I recently bought and surprisingly loved &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27; (also by Katy Perry).</li>
            <li> not too sweet, and i think this would work for all ages.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to pick this out of a line up of scents.  </li>
            <li> Even though I wasn&#x27;t over the moon about the perfume itself, it does smell good and is totally wearable.  </li>
            <li> bought as a birthday present for my wife,she loved it.</li>
            <li> The only thing to complain about is the bottle has a ding on the bottom of it and looks a bit scraped but good thing</li>
            <li> Lovely parfume fast shipping</li>
            <li> Sweet but not too sweet</li>
            <li> that much is true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent just wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> scent is wonderful, but the formula needs serious tweaking...</li>
            <li> I was first attracted by the adorable cat perfume bottle - I really, really wanted it!</li>
            <li> It was packaged and sealed as if I bought it from ULTA, and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> I GOT LUCKY GIVING THIS TO MY WIFE</li>
            <li> The perfume is light and crisp, not cloying or over-powerful.</li>
            <li> and since it was so cheap i didn&#x27;t care to check it out in the store first.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend bought me two more bottle for an early valentines gift and I was so excited.</li>
            <li> The bottles super cute and the scent is very light, not too strong or heavy.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very sweet/light and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, not to strong.</li>
            <li> This seller&#x27;s product is authentic and a larger bottle for a cheaper price than I paid years ago when I first fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Just wish I got it the first time I ordered the darn thing!  </li>
            <li> Bottle was less than the price of a 1 oz in the store, so fabulous bargain!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light on the sandalwood and musk, and just gives enough to linger lightly.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing,</li>
            <li> but it gives me a headache because it just kind of stays in a cloud around your body to where only YOU can smell it and others</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more mature than midnight fantasy though, the way the fragrance develops and smells.</li>
            <li> I will likely order Katy Perry&#x27;s Meow as well, just because I am so thrilled with the value and the bottle...and it may turn out</li>
            <li> A really good deal compared to what I would&#x27;ve spent at a department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice perfume for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle of perfume for the price, compared to most others and the floral, slightly citrusy scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon with a special discount (49.99) for the large 3.4 ounce bottle, which was cheaper than the price at the store (55.00 for the 1.7 ounce bottle).  </li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, just right.  </li>
            <li> Purr has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to describe a scent, but I&#x27;d say this is a \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; fruity as opposed to the bubble gum fruity of stuff like Love&#x27;s Berry Sweet (which I also wear).  </li>
            <li> It was nice in that the scent lasted a long time</li>
            <li> The perfume has a great scent just the right amount of sweetness and lasting power is terrific.</li>
            <li> , if you have a 20 - 30 year old wife/girlfriend/sister, this will probably be a good present for them.</li>
            <li> if it lasted for more then a few hours I would definately buy more</li>
            <li> Lucky the bottle was not broken</li>
            <li> and it is really a big volume for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I have a large collection of fragrances and this may be my new super sweet fave.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the item arrived!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent several years ago.</li>
            <li> With that said, Purr is an absolute winner!</li>
            <li> However, based off reviews it seemed like exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves it on me as well :) Also, shipping only took a week even though I&#x27;m overseas</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than meow.</li>
            <li> The order was received on time and exactly as I imagined.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is so cute and much bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The lasting power is OKAY..</li>
            <li> The first time I came across it in Marie Claire, I was intrigued that Katy Perry was using it herself.</li>
            <li> The scent is very feminine, very fruity, not too sweet at all.</li>
            <li> She wears it daily because everyone always asks her what she&#x27;s wearing, they love it too.  </li>
            <li> It was the first thing I picked up.  </li>
            <li> ; (Thanks guys!)</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous ordering this without smelling it first, but after reading through the reviews I decided I&#x27;d go for it.</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for its not for me</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying both fragrances again! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The bottle is really pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok a little strong at first</li>
            <li> Katy Perry&#x27;s other perfume &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; however is AMAZING..</li>
            <li> I love layered fragrances, I cannot stand the flat, one-note fits all scents.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I do agree scent seems to not last as long - but for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about the scents I wear, especially since my family members are allergic to most perfumes out there, but this one just works with me.</li>
            <li> so I decided to read the reviews, which were mostly positive.</li>
            <li> But within about three hours the perfume is mild and completely gone.</li>
            <li> For the price and how large it is?</li>
            <li> You will certainly feel like the &#x27;cat&#x27;s meow&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am not sure how my daughter feels about the perfume, but she was thrilled with such a cute bottle.</li>
            <li> fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> and I suppose support for Katy haha</li>
            <li> So fast that I sometimes I spray it on before bed</li>
            <li> And it was very well packaged</li>
            <li> , I even dropped the box accidentally when I got home and was afraid I&#x27;d damaged it, but to my relief, it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> So sit back and enjoy all the compliments you get with this one ladies.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, and very girly.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the one you can find at Macy&#x27;s, but this one is sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> ..also shipping was fast...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> , I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes it, and so do I.  </li>
            <li> The presentation, design and quality of the product is very impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this same fragrance free from the link below:https://www.listia.com</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like purr as much as I do meow</li>
            <li> much to our surprise, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping time was reasonable.</li>
            <li> , this was a reasonably priced option</li>
            <li> Purr is a concoction of peach nectar, forbidden apple, a distinct floral bouquet of jasmine blossom, Bulgarian rose, and vanilla orchid, with slowly revealing accents of creamy sandalwood and musk.</li>
            <li> This arrived kind of slow but worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> When I used the perfume, I smelled gardenia, not peach, as many other people said in their reviews.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised to say I like it very much even though I am a guy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very powerful, intense, sweet, fruity and feminine smell that is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> This smell could be worn on a young adult (which I believe the bottle is marketed for), but it is a scent sophisticated enough for women of any age.</li>
            <li> I remember playing with cheap perfumes when I was younger and this brought me right back to those memories.</li>
            <li> Cute packaging and adorable bottle, but would not buy again and unable to return it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for yourself or to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> but the price was way too high for my taste.  </li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend this to anyone considering this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for women and girls of any age .  </li>
            <li> Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr starts off with a peach nectar and apple scent, in a high end type of way.</li>
            <li> However after about an hour, it settles into a distinct but subtle scent (mostly vanilla).</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of those rare ones that actually appeal to me, because it is one of the sweetest perfumes, and when you put it on for a date, he is going to notice and compliment you!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> All pretty much the same and</li>
            <li> Like other people have said though, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as most other perfumes do, but the trade off is worth it because I love when she wears it.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> she cant sing live but this is one hell of a perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle is even better in person than online, and it is much bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> scent is fantastic - the mid and under-tones leave a lasting impression.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my very young daughter, I like it</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to the world of perfumes or if you&#x27;re a seasoned veteran when it comes to this stuff</li>
            <li> I paid for a pretty bottle with a generic scent...</li>
            <li> Apparently, it&#x27;s different for everyone, because other reviewers love it and say it lasts for them.</li>
            <li> I do know cheaper perfumes fade quickly, but I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that from this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The big kitty head top makes it a little tip-prone.</li>
            <li> Plus, unlike other fruity splashes that fade away in less than 10 minutes, this has lasted over 3 hours and still has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a generic smell to drug store perfumes that this is very close to.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it seems that it is for young girls.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this perfume for a young adult women maybe around 18 - 25 or so.</li>
            <li> At least I was able to return it.  </li>
            <li> We got this for our 23 yr old daughter&#x27;s birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a very decent/nice scent.</li>
            <li> Me liking the scent so much is probably why it took me a while to realize that the scent doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li> THis was a gift for my 8 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> I was stunned to find the 3.4oz bottle for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> To me personally, it was very powdery</li>
            <li> The top doesnt stay on the bottle and the scent, it doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD perfume, though I did find it to be a bit vanilla-y and floral for my tastes even though vanilla was fairly far down on the list of notes.  </li>
            <li> I have been through most of the celebrity perfumes, but have found that they usually come up short.</li>
            <li> I just ordered and the package is soo pretty and such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that the fragrance could last a little longer, but I guess that can be fixed by taking it with you if you have a really long day ahead and want to keep smelling nice till the end of it :)</li>
            <li> If you like soft sweet scents this is it, the only downs side is that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The bottle is big, solid, heavy and adorable.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear chanel perfume and gucci, wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> to a site that show&#x27;s you scents similar to what you normally wear or would like to wear</li>
            <li> It certainly does not live to the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; claim on the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty feminine scent but also has a little vanilla muskiness to it.</li>
            <li> and it last pretty long..</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is original KP scent.</li>
            <li> It too, like Meow, is a long-lasting perfume that I can still smell on my wrists at night after only two sprits in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li> It sits very close to the skin, projection is minimal.</li>
            <li> REALLY WISH AMAZON would post that this item is non-returnable in much larger print closer to other information.  </li>
            <li> a little spritz on your wrists and neck will be enough to last through the day and right into the</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the fruity smell, as that&#x27;s the typical perfumes I&#x27;m attracted to, but didn&#x27;t smell that at all.</li>
            <li> I was almost surprised when I opened this up because I expected something smaller like you see at the stores, but this will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Meow by Katy Perry instead, in my personal opinion this fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the perfume does not last long on your skin.</li>
            <li> You only need to spray it one time and it&#x27;ll last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with another review when she said it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> so it might last really long on your skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance, however, doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not  long lasting either, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> The impression was very sweet/creamy.. while this one is VERY heavy floral.</li>
            <li> but the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long,</li>
            <li> The perfume wears completely off after only a few hours, which was a bummer.</li>
            <li> Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr is long lasting, complex, and makes me feel very sensual.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid this is just a cute decoration to have</li>
            <li> Much larger, heavier, and nicer than I expected from the picture.</li>
            <li> The bottle was much larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Although it was among the other smells such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, I would recommend it for woman of all ages not just teens.</li>
            <li> The smell is like old avon perfume, with a strong vanilla base.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it would last a little longer but for the price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I ordered the largest size which was at least $60 at retail stores near me.  </li>
            <li> product came as expected and on time</li>
            <li> but I expected  something sweeter.  </li>
            <li> you really do not need this one.</li>
            <li> Never really been a celebrity perfume kinda girl..</li>
            <li> Everything that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected due to USPS error not seller.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, so</li>
            <li> My only complaint is in the design of the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> They tracked down my package when my tracking for the item  did not work and were going to ship me a replacement  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of Poison but less costly.  </li>
            <li> The perfume itself I found to be fairly typical of the spread offered at Walgreens or the like.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time with a few other little bonuses in the box.</li>
            <li> but with little potency.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little niece.  </li>
            <li> A little wary about something considered &amp;#34;already opened&amp;#34;, but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered this perfume even though I&#x27;ve never smelled it before (living overseas, so it&#x27;s not available here).</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t heavy and didn&#x27;t overwhelm</li>
            <li> ,I gave it a few hours before I don&#x27;t smell it any more.\\&quot; MEOW\\&quot; made by Kate Perry</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already knocked it off the counter a couple times and broken the bottom of the bottle (only the exterior silver part - no spilling).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, and prefer complex, layered scents (in other words, I don&#x27;t wish to smell like a cupcake or cotton candy).</li>
            <li> This perfume smells divine; lightly sweet and fruity with a musky base.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be one that i could wear everyday, but i haven&#x27;t hardly even touched my bottle that i got months ago.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase, again.</li>
            <li> thinking it might be too small.</li>
            <li> Upon smelling it though, I was actually pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but Midnight Fantasy is a little too reminiscent of crazy downtown nights.</li>
            <li> It sounded like something I&#x27;d like the smell of at least.</li>
            <li> This perfume actually made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I know it wont last :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find someone who will like this as it&#x27;s a very common smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> but i was definitely proved wrong!!</li>
            <li> but im not happy</li>
            <li> Poor Katy!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Nothing at all wrong with this scent, but if you have Jessica</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll break</li>
            <li> Celebrity perfumes are extremely expensive let alone retail markups!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it smells bad or anything because it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not anything I would wear.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed after receiving it.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is the worst smelling stuff ever!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Kudos to Katy Perry for designing not only a beautiful statuesque perfume bottle but a superb fragrance as well.  Personally, between Purr and Meow, they are both five star fragrances as I always receive compliments anytime I wear either one.  Purr is my favorite though because it has a sharpness to it, not as light and sweet as Meow comes off.  Purr will definitely draw attention, wanted or unwanted.  It too, like Meow, is a long-lasting perfume that I can still smell on my wrists at night after only two sprits in the early morning hours.  Something about Purr provides a unique edginess, in comparison to Meow, making it a seemingly stronger fragrance.  I recommend Purr for anytime you wish to be recognized because you will be noticed and complimented repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Loved it..Pretty and smell really nice!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and arrived fast!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Meow by Katy Perry instead, in my personal opinion this fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long and I find myself having to re spray it. It smells good, but Meow by Katy Perry is better. Either way, Purr still smells good and it was a great deal so you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent several years ago. When I tried to go back to the store to purchase again (a couple years later), they no longer carried it. This seller&#x27;s product is authentic and a larger bottle for a cheaper price than I paid years ago when I first fell in love with it. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> I look by internet in site amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I  by for me and my son.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended For every one&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good</li>
            <li> product came as expected and on time</li>
            <li> Great itemâ€¦ . fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume addict. I love rich, delicious scents that are not cloying or too heavy. I&#x27;m 39, and prefer complex, layered scents (in other words, I don&#x27;t wish to smell like a cupcake or cotton candy). With that said, Purr is an absolute winner! This smell could be worn on a young adult (which I believe the bottle is marketed for), but it is a scent sophisticated enough for women of any age. It&#x27;s not too fruity, too flowery, or too musky, but has a perfect blend of each. Purr is a concoction of peach nectar, forbidden apple, a distinct floral bouquet of jasmine blossom, Bulgarian rose, and vanilla orchid, with slowly revealing accents of creamy sandalwood and musk. It&#x27;s very light on the sandalwood and musk, and just gives enough to linger lightly. I have been through most of the celebrity perfumes, but have found that they usually come up short. They tend to fade fast, and appear to be mostly about marketing hype. Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr is long lasting, complex, and makes me feel very sensual. My  husband loves it, and I was stopped once at a Starbucks, and twice in the mall by women wanting to know what perfume I was wearing. I&#x27;d say that speaks volumes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenager niece as a Christmas gift it smells so nice and sweet I wanna keep it lol. If you like soft sweet scents this is it, the only downs side is that it doesn&#x27;t last long but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I love this on my girl.</li>
            <li> Product was just as advertised</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this. The bottle is soooo flipping cute that I almost can&#x27;t stand it. It&#x27;s very original. However, I don&#x27;t feel that the scent is original at all. I&#x27;m not going to say it smells bad or anything because it doesn&#x27;t. But the smell just reminds me of a lot of perfumes. There&#x27;s a generic smell to drug store perfumes that this is very close to. So a huge part of me just can&#x27;t justify it. I paid for a pretty bottle with a generic scent... Scent&#x27;s will pick up differently on everyones skin. On my skin it smells mostly fruity, powdery. The scent does change through the day which is interesting. I like more what it smells like hours after having it on haha but I&#x27;m afraid this is just a cute decoration to have and I suppose support for Katy haha</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly as described! Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and smell good</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my daughter who loves cats. i bought it hoping she might like the cologne too, and lo and behold, she loves it.</li>
            <li> The product is beautiful to smell and in its appearance.  Great value and service from sellers.  I would highly recommend this for yourself or to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I think it smells beautiful !</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered this perfume even though I&#x27;ve never smelled it before (living overseas, so it&#x27;s not available here). However, based off reviews it seemed like exactly what I was looking for. I was not disappointed. When you first spray it on, the scent is strong but pleasant (orange blossom). However after about an hour, it settles into a distinct but subtle scent (mostly vanilla). I love it! My fiance loves it on me as well :) Also, shipping only took a week even though I&#x27;m overseas (APO address).</li>
            <li> Bought this at a great price after the wife picked out the scent at the department stores. The savings are incredible when shopping through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I liked the perfume, the smell was nice.  With that being said, it seems that it is for young girls. It reminded me of cotton candy and I wasn&#x27;t all that fond of it.  It was nice in that the scent lasted a long time and I did get several compliments on it.  It also wasn&#x27;t heavy and didn&#x27;t overwhelm</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume and style of glass is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Nice sent but wears out fast.  So fast that I sometimes I spray it on before bed cause I know it wont last :(</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume at a nearby store and really liked it but the price was way too high for my taste.  Found it on Amazon with a special discount (49.99) for the large 3.4 ounce bottle, which was cheaper than the price at the store (55.00 for the 1.7 ounce bottle).  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the item arrived! And it was very well packaged, I even dropped the box accidentally when I got home and was afraid I&#x27;d damaged it, but to my relief, it was in perfect condition. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This scent is sultry,sexy,sinful,sassy and more Your man will love it,and so will others. So sit back and enjoy all the compliments you get with this one ladies. Not overpowering, and very girly.I simply love it and I know you will too!</li>
            <li> i love Katy Perry so i had to get this perfume. i even bought it without ever smelling it cause i knew it would be great no matter what. and it is! i spray it everywhere and even my roommates love it! I have a travel bottle, a medium bottle (3.4oz)and then the biggest bottle of it available. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, great deal. Not the longest lasting perfume but it&#x27;s good enough. I actually like this better than meow.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Smells just like the one you can find at Macy&#x27;s, but this one is sold for a reasonable price. This perfume has a sweet smell to it. I would recommend this perfume for a young adult women maybe around 18 - 25 or so. Great for those who like a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume, it seems to smell more fruity when u first spray it on, then when it dries it smells more floral. The bottles super cute and the scent is very light, not too strong or heavy. I&#x27;m 44 and it&#x27;s something I will definitely wear often. I wish men would comment more on womens perfumes, their reviews and comments are interesting.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how my daughter feels about the perfume, but she was thrilled with such a cute bottle. She did take a sliht smell and said it seemed nice.</li>
            <li> Much larger, heavier, and nicer than I expected from the picture. This will make the ultimate gift! The perfume is light and crisp, not cloying or over-powerful. Very pleased with this purchase- a true bargain!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would. Musky. Blah</li>
            <li> I love the smell it has a sweet floral, citrus, grape sent to me.It&#x27;s more of a spring and summer sent ,but it can be worn any season if you wish. I would have to agree with another review when she said it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I like perfumes that last all day, I would say from the moment I sprayed it on,I gave it a few hours before I don&#x27;t smell it any more.\\&quot; MEOW\\&quot; made by Kate Perry last a lot longer for some reason and it also smells really nice they are both made for either a grown woman or younger lady.</li>
            <li> I absolutley adore Katy Perry!  My husband gave me the Purr gift set for Christmas, said he loved it in the store.  It is the worst smelling stuff ever! At least I was able to return it.  Poor Katy!</li>
            <li> I admit it. I was first attracted by the adorable cat perfume bottle - I really, really wanted it! However, I couldn&#x27;t find any stores locally that sell the perfume so I could smell it. Fortunately, I received this as a gift and I am very pleased.  The bottle is even better in person than online, and it is much bigger than I expected.  I have uploaded a picture of it next to a mass market paperback book and they are almost the same height.  The scent was also a pleasant surprise. I prefer fruity, sweet fragrances.  This one is fruity, but with a musky undertone.  It&#x27;s not easy to describe a scent, but I&#x27;d say this is a \\&quot;more mature\\&quot; fruity as opposed to the bubble gum fruity of stuff like Love&#x27;s Berry Sweet (which I also wear).  Plus, unlike other fruity splashes that fade away in less than 10 minutes, this has lasted over 3 hours and still has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this fragrance.  And I find myself being tempted by Katy&#x27;s \\&quot;Meow\\&quot; scent in a similar bottle...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It has almost a tropical/cocunut smell to it.  It is not overpowering, just right.  Although it was among the other smells such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, I would recommend it for woman of all ages not just teens.</li>
            <li> I have zero idea what makes a good perfume good. Zero. This smells good, my wife wanted it, I bought it. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you have a 20 - 30 year old wife/girlfriend/sister, this will probably be a good present for them.</li>
            <li> Yup that is what you will being saying  Love the smell of Purr and the kitty is so adorable..also shipping was fast...thank you</li>
            <li> it smells too sweet for me&lt;br /&gt;and too floral&lt;br /&gt;but it is good in total&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> i love it!  it was in good condition!  it is quite cheap when you buy in amazon!  Next time i&#x27;ll buy the MEOW perfume by Katy Perry!</li>
            <li> This is my girlfriends favorite, she was out and I got the largest bottle, I love the smell of it on her and she thinks I paid like $100 for it, so...win, win, win!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfume at first I was a bit skeptical but i was definitely proved wrong!! It lasts a long time and it smells great once this bottle is gone I will be purchasing another one!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the largest size which was at least $60 at retail stores near me.  I got it for about $46, including shipping.  The order was received on time and exactly as I imagined.  The bottle is VERY cute and the perfume smells heavenly.  Will probably repurchase!</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for my girlfriend who loves katy perry. she loves it! litterally wears it every day and neither of us tire of its scent! Arrived on time with a few other little bonuses in the box. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance, my girlfriend is very happy, lasting quality, very satisfied with the product, received in excellent condition, so I rated it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Purr has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of those rare ones that actually appeal to me, because it is one of the sweetest perfumes, and when you put it on for a date, he is going to notice and compliment you! Good luck!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and of coarse my wife loves the bottle. Like other people have said though, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as most other perfumes do, but the trade off is worth it because I love when she wears it.</li>
            <li> excellent gift for my sister birthday</li>
            <li> Not my kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I. LOVE. THIS. PERFUME. lol i smells really nice. its kind of floral-y and it smells really sophisticated. the only problem i have with it is the fact that it DOES NOT last on my skin at all. idk why tho. so it might last really long on your skin. so give it a try  :)</li>
            <li> she cant sing live but this is one hell of a perfume. its creamy and delicious. i love it. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Meow ! This was a great purchase I bought as a gift and they loved it so I would highly recommend this to anyone considering this</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is original KP scent. The top doesnt stay on the bottle and the scent, it doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes. Wont be buying from here again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle! The fragrance is light &amp; clean and really pretty!  We got this for our 23 yr old daughter&#x27;s birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on a whim as I recently bought and surprisingly loved &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27; (also by Katy Perry). This perfume smells divine; lightly sweet and fruity with a musky base. Cute bottle too. You dont need to put on much and it lasts for most of the day!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful smell! I love this scent!</li>
            <li> This is a Great price &amp; just like I bought it at a dept store! I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Smells so good. It&#x27;s a nice, rich scent that&#x27;s not too sweet or too overpowering. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. Even if I put it on hours ago, the scent lasts when you get up close. Love.</li>
            <li> i love this scent! it smells so good! not too sweet, and i think this would work for all ages. i love this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves Katy Perry and she loves purple. The bottle is so cute and much bigger than I thought it would be. She is going to love it!</li>
            <li> I really liked the bottle that this came in so I decided to try it out, I really like the smell but the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, if it lasted for more then a few hours I would definately buy more but I&#x27;m probably going to switch to a different perfume!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok a little strong at first but it wears well and last all day. The smell kind of reminded me of potpourri at first but once it settles it smells better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very sweet! I have to say, i went for the cat bottle and the reviews were so good and since it was so cheap i didn&#x27;t care to check it out in the store first. For my liking it just smells like candy, very girly fragrance, not for a grown up woman, and the smell itself is kind of cheap. I tried to like it and used it maybe twice but the smell didnt last at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very well made and very cute.  The fragrance, however, doesn&#x27;t last too long.  The scent fades within hours.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  The cat bottle is very cute.  She also like the smell.  As a matter of fact so did her Mom!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. Its not too sweet or floral just perfect. Wish it could last longer but its a great smell</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Reminds me of Poison but less costly.  My 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> smells great and got it at a very good price, not to mention the bottle is very pretty</li>
            <li> I can not understand the hype about this perfume!it smells like laundry soap or something! but it could just be me.wouldnt buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried an impression of this perfume at a dollar store and LOVED it, so i went on amazon immediately and bought the largest bottle. I was so disappointed after receiving it. The impression was very sweet/creamy.. while this one is VERY heavy floral. I thought that this would be one that i could wear everyday, but i haven&#x27;t hardly even touched my bottle that i got months ago. The lasting power is OKAY.. nothing special but it gives me a headache because it just kind of stays in a cloud around your body to where only YOU can smell it and others can&#x27;t. It sits very close to the skin, projection is minimal. Katy Perry&#x27;s other perfume &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34; however is AMAZING.. i wear it a lot, it&#x27;s very sweet/light and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I like katy perry  , love cats, and the bottle is so pretty.  there aren&#x27;t many perfumes that I like, but wow this smells wonderful warm and fresh at the same time.  I wear it everyday.  I would highly recommend for women and girls of any age .  christy</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes it, and so do I.  It&#x27;s a very nice perfume for everyday wear.  Plus, it&#x27;s cat-themed.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Came a day before date..Soo inlove with this smell</li>
            <li> I ordered both scents and Katy perry meow is much better . It&#x27;s not a bad scent just wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Very happy with the perfume but im not happy everytime i put perfume the lid along with the spray ring comes out and i get parfume on my hands. Deffective bottle</li>
            <li> I had no problems and my order was on time</li>
            <li> Smells great and the packaging is cute. My only problem is that the perfume does not last long on your skin. It fades a away after about an hour.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love, love, love the initial scent of Katy Perry!! The mid-tones are awesome, too. But within about three hours the perfume is mild and completely gone. Before you can make it home from school or work, it&#x27;s as if you put nothing on. Such a shame!  Maybe it&#x27;s our body chemistry. I do know cheaper perfumes fade quickly, but I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that from this fragrance. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase, again. I know I will not wear it for work. I want my perfume to last all day at work. Perhaps, for me, it will be a date night or event perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the cat container.  It goes well with Katy Parry&#x27;s Meow parfum.  If you like cats, I suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, pretty and large for the money. When I used the perfume, I smelled gardenia, not peach, as many other people said in their reviews. The perfume smells best about 1/2 hour after application; warm, creamy soft vanilla. The perfume wears completely off after only a few hours, which was a bummer.</li>
            <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
            <li> Great item and received as promised.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell but I expected  something sweeter.  It&#x27;s kind of citric&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is really cute though</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous on the size of the bottle. thinking it might be too small. It is HUMONGOUS and the best value I have found. Smell a bit strong when you first apply it, but about 5 minutes later, the aroma is the perfect mix of sweet and sultry. It was packaged and sealed as if I bought it from ULTA, and quickly shipped. All around happy, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I loved it. it smells amazing and the bottle is super cute for cat lovers lime myself. love cat love cats</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece for her birthday and she loves it!  The bottle is so cute and the package come exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long. Cute packaging and adorable bottle, but would not buy again and unable to return it. May not be authentic.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The bottle for this perfume is adorable and it&#x27;s a great price for how much you get! It is a lovely scent but it&#x27;s also rather generic, but then again it is a celebrity perfume. It&#x27;s a very pretty feminine scent but also has a little vanilla muskiness to it. It&#x27;s great for teenagers and young women and can be worn anywhere. Overall, it&#x27;s a very decent/nice scent.</li>
            <li> smells really good and the bottle is supper cute</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and I always get compliments</li>
            <li> Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr starts off with a peach nectar and apple scent, in a high end type of way. Not like a regular fruit body spray. It is rich and delicious, very sweet. The fragrance delivers lovely candyish vibes with some floral, vanilla and sandalwood notes as it settles. It lasts well on me and I love it for when i want something super sweet but Midnight Fantasy is a little too reminiscent of crazy downtown nights. It&#x27;s a bit more mature than midnight fantasy though, the way the fragrance develops and smells. I love layered fragrances, I cannot stand the flat, one-note fits all scents. So this is purrfect. I have a large collection of fragrances and this may be my new super sweet fave.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing, but the scent lasts for hours and hours, especially when u wear it with the body wash and body lotion.</li>
            <li> This did not smell very good at all.</li>
            <li> I feel bittersweet about Purr. The first time I came across it in Marie Claire, I was intrigued that Katy Perry was using it herself. I put Purr on my Christmas list last year, and my husband gave it to me as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I loved the scent very much. It reminded me of grapes, and I love grapes! The scent is very feminine, very fruity, not too sweet at all. Me liking the scent so much is probably why it took me a while to realize that the scent doesn&#x27;t last...I would spray even more, on the skin and clothes, thinking that it would help the fragrance to stay longer. But it feels like it disappears in 5 minutes. This is very disappointing. Apparently, it&#x27;s different for everyone, because other reviewers love it and say it lasts for them. Not for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful, but the formula needs serious tweaking...It certainly does not live to the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; claim on the package. I read the same thing about it in one review of celebrity fragrances, so it wasn&#x27;t just me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend because in my experience it didn&#x27;t last, and I wouldn&#x27;t risk giving someone else something that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> all excellent, and I received the product in Venezuela, waiting times were set, many thanks, recommended 100%, thanks, success and blessings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume!! I have gotten so many compliments on it amd would definitely recommend it to my friends!!</li>
            <li> THis was a gift for my 8 yr old daughter and I also love it.  She wears it daily because everyone always asks her what she&#x27;s wearing, they love it too.  Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an addition to Katys Meow. I get compliments every time I wear it. Just wish it would last a little longer but for the price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get something marketed by a popstar, but this is a great smelling purfume, its fresh and sophisticated</li>
            <li> I bought this for my very young daughter, I like it but some scents aren&#x27;t for me, it smells good on my daughter.</li>
            <li> Adorable!  Light scent, perfect for my teen Granddaughter!  The bottle was much larger than I expected.  Re-ordered another for my sister who adores cats!</li>
            <li> Bottle was less than the price of a 1 oz in the store, so fabulous bargain!!!  The bottle is big, solid, heavy and adorable.  The perfume itself I found to be fairly typical of the spread offered at Walgreens or the like.  It&#x27;s not a BAD perfume, though I did find it to be a bit vanilla-y and floral for my tastes even though vanilla was fairly far down on the list of notes.  It was the first thing I picked up.  It may just be how it&#x27;s reacting to my personal body chemistry.  It  also leans on the generic side...I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to pick this out of a line up of scents.  It&#x27;s not  long lasting either, but I expected that. You would have to spritz it on your clothing rather than skin to get a good wear time.  I have quite an extensive collection and I&#x27;ve found that the celebrity endorsed perfumes (Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Halle Berry, Beyonce etc) are all wonderful scents but the staying power is a bit short compared to say, Clinique Happy Heart or Chanel.  This is made by Coty, who makes some great scents (one of my all time drugstore favorites was Ghost Myst!)  but with little potency.  Even though I wasn&#x27;t over the moon about the perfume itself, it does smell good and is totally wearable.  Combine that with the awesome price it&#x27;s offered for through the Amazon warehouse (I paid $26 with shipping for a 3.4oz), and the fantastic display value of the bottle itself...I do like this and would recommend it.  I will likely order Katy Perry&#x27;s Meow as well, just because I am so thrilled with the value and the bottle...and it may turn out Meow is more to my tastes.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she said she loves it. It smells good to me so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I remember smelling this perfume on my auntie and i didnt even know what it what i just knew i wanted it! She let me have it and i ran out of it but i knew i wanted to purchase it in the future. I just ordered and the package is soo pretty and such a big bottle. You only need to spray it one time and it&#x27;ll last you a long time! This my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> A bit strong but smells nice. You only need one spray and it will last.</li>
            <li> If you like charming, florally, bamboo, jasmine, a hint of fruit and a splash of amazing, this is the perfume for you.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses it and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> I love how sweet and gentle this perfume smells! I am very picky about the scents I wear, especially since my family members are allergic to most perfumes out there, but this one just works with me. I am not saying that the scent is for everyone, just mentioning that I love it. For the price and how large it is? This is an amazing deal! Celebrity perfumes are extremely expensive let alone retail markups! I was almost surprised when I opened this up because I expected something smaller like you see at the stores, but this will last me a long time! Amazon is the online Costco of the world :)</li>
            <li> I normally wear chanel perfume and gucci, wanted to try something different.  This perfume actually made me sick to my stomach.  The smell is like old avon perfume, with a strong vanilla base.  Amazon won&#x27;t let you return perfume so I just lost&lt;br /&gt;65 dollars.  The bottle is real cute, gave it to my daughter, she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves everything by Katy Perry and I won this great perfume from &amp;#34;Take Our Stuff&amp;#34; (Thanks guys!) The minute it arrived my Mom started wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice floral scent, with notes of Vanilla and peach.  After wearing for awhile it deepens and becomes even more exotic. A little goes a long way.  Suitable for day or evening wear.</li>
            <li> This product was a Xmas day present. The presentation, design and quality of the product is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very powerful, intense, sweet, fruity and feminine smell that is fairly long lasting. I believe that it offers very good value for money given the smell, volume and price.</li>
            <li> Sweet and pleasant! Nothing at all wrong with this scent, but if you have Jessica Simpson/ Brittney Spears/Mariah Carey stuff- you really do not need this one. All pretty much the same and some of those are better. Cute gift for a cat-loving pre-teen or teenager, however.</li>
            <li> I got to sample at the mall and I am surprised to say I like it very much even though I am a guy, i am getting it soon for myself!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very cute and the fragance is good.  I think that it could perfect gift for someone women</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked all over the packaging. Lucky the bottle was not broken</li>
            <li> I got this same fragrance free from the link below:https://www.listia.com/signup/7132912 I&#x27;ve gotten all types of brand name products free!(ex.Apple,Samsung,Amazon,LG,Disney,Coach,Chanel,Katy Perry,BeyoncÃ©,Jessica Simpson,Nikki Minaj,Halle Berry,bath and body works,Victoria secret,Fisher Price,Nike) products like(ex.tablets,smartphones,toys,health &amp; beauty, household product,chromecast,furniture) that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg! Believe me this site is worth checking out!! Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Everything was fine.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Katy Perry is one of my idols so as soon as i discovered this fragrance i knew i had to purchase asap! To be honest, it is not a scent that I can wear a lot though. It is a very sexy mature scent in my opinion and might not be in my age range. I&#x27;m 19 and I feel it is more of a mid/late 20s kind of scent. i still love it though! That&#x27;s just my opinion, anyone can wear it :)</li>
            <li> Love it!! Would buy again! I would recommend for someone around the age of 16-20s.. great price for the size I got also.</li>
            <li> Never really been a celebrity perfume kinda girl.. But after smelling its impression( that I also loved) I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Boy was I happy when I did, it&#x27;s freaking awesome. Smells sweet not floral at all, it&#x27;s a bit strong so don&#x27;t need to spray a bunch and it last pretty long.. Boyfriend bought me two more bottle for an early valentines gift and I was so excited. I see everyone&#x27;s saying meow smells better I personally did not like meow. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it smells good ( also have a bottle) but it&#x27;s more towards a person who likes light not to sweet fragrances. I would Definetly recommend this perfume and meow as well  it&#x27;s good to try new things new fragrances, you may be surprised on which ones you like &lt;3 (( Also snooki&#x27;s perfume is awesome if you like sweet perfumes like this one give that one a try ))</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I like her to wear, has a delicious flavor and is super durable, and even better if I have to Katy Perry on the cover of the packaging. :P</li>
            <li> bought as a birthday present for my wife,she loved it.</li>
            <li> Got this gift for my best friend, Her birthday is coming up. This arrived kind of slow but worth the wait.  Smells good, but I do agree scent seems to not last as long - but for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it. The only thing to complain about is the bottle has a ding on the bottom of it and looks a bit scraped but good thing it&#x27;s about the smell, and not just the appearance!</li>
            <li> Love it, great price.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter was very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little niece.  It really smells good.  She wears it every day and the smell stays with her.</li>
            <li> I totally love this perfume</li>
            <li> It smells good. Just wish I got it the first time I ordered the darn thing!  Love Katy Perry Lots!</li>
            <li> REALLY WISH AMAZON would post that this item is non-returnable in much larger print closer to other information.  I realize it is my responsibility to read all the info and didn&#x27;t.  I could not believe Perfume was non-returnable.  It&#x27;s Christmas just trying to shop and didn&#x27;t take the time to read the fine print.  WILL PAY CLOSE ATTENTION from now on</li>
            <li> I smelt a hint of grapefruit in there I believe, but it smells soooo good! I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments, and the bottle is soooooo super cute!</li>
            <li> I GOT LUCKY GIVING THIS TO MY WIFE BUT IT GUYS NOT ONLY IS SHE GONNA SMELL GOOD BUT KATY PERRYS ON IT AND WHAT WOMAN DON;T LOVE CATS</li>
            <li> Picked up a bottle of this perfume for my wife for Christmas this year. She thinks it&#x27;s great and so does the rest of the family. The cool-looking bottle is just a bit of icing on the cake. I would definitely recommend this product to women, or to guys who are out looking for a gift for thier lady-friend(s) or sister(s)!</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell and is her favorite present. She is thrilled and very happy. Very nice packaging.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves this.  I think the bottle is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;We are both happy with the product and the price</li>
            <li> Lovely parfume fast shipping</li>
            <li> I think it smells great on her.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous ordering this without smelling it first, but after reading through the reviews I decided I&#x27;d go for it. It sounded like something I&#x27;d like the smell of at least. And I do! It&#x27;s a very lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak. My only complaint is in the design of the bottle itself. The big kitty head top makes it a little tip-prone. I&#x27;ve already knocked it off the counter a couple times and broken the bottom of the bottle (only the exterior silver part - no spilling). I now keep it in the cabinet without the top on it.</li>
            <li> It smells great. Everything that I expected it to be. I am completely satisfied. Very good quality. Was received promptly.l</li>
            <li> A little wary about something considered &amp;#34;already opened&amp;#34;, but was pleasantly surprised.  Great condition!!  The recepient was thrilled!  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like purr as much as I do meow,  the charm already came off and the head comes off so easily I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll break, I think it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> it smells like patchouli after awhile , you know that grandma smell i love perfume but this isn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for its not for me</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume sight unsmelled and I love it. It&#x27;s a large bottle of perfume for the price, compared to most others and the floral, slightly citrusy scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> my wife like this product</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait till my granddaughter sees this!!</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it. Sweet but not too sweet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cat lover.. that much is true. So without a doubt, this perfume bottle tops all of them in my book. This adorable kitty is all glass (plastic head) of purple/blueish hue and around the neck, a metal collar. Dangling from it, a metal heart charm with the word Purr etched in. The bottle itself is large, has some nice weight to it and easily contours to your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fantastic - the mid and under-tones leave a lasting impression. Simply sweet, sexy and not too over-powering. You will certainly feel like the &#x27;cat&#x27;s meow&#x27; when you put this on. A little goes a long way though, so a little spritz on your wrists and neck will be enough to last through the day and right into the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price and shipping can&#x27;t be beat either. I was stunned to find the 3.4oz bottle for such a reasonable price. My fiance ordered it for me a week before Christmas and even though it said it may not arrive before then, much to our surprise, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to the world of perfumes or if you&#x27;re a seasoned veteran when it comes to this stuff.. Purr is the purrfect choice for anyone looking for something that smells sexy, appealing and fun but doesn&#x27;t offend the nose by being too cloyingly sweet or over-powering.</li>
            <li> I gave the perfume as a gift, and they gave it raves they really love it and so does her husband. I&#x27;m very happy that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was on my granddaughter&#x27;s wish list and it exceeded her expectations.  She loved everything about it.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, not to strong. Shipping time was reasonable. Love the cute bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Went to a site that show&#x27;s you scents similar to what you normally wear or would like to wear and it gives you options, this was a reasonably priced option and I do like it, I used Princess by Vera Wang as the comparison</li>
            <li> Awesome bottle smells great</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister since she loves the fragrance and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on Amazon.  She was very happy with the product and will be buying more I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume with good smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. The perfect citrus and fruity scent. This is my second time buying it and I also love meow as well. Will definitely be buying both fragrances again! :)-Brisce M</li>
            <li> I was browsing through perfumes and just happened to come across Purr by Katy Perry. The cute bottle got my attention so I decided to read the reviews, which were mostly positive. I figured, what the heck, sounds good I&#x27;ll give it a try! It shipped Monday and was delivered Tuesday afternoon, (I ordered it Saturday night with standard shipping) so that was a pleasant surprise. Upon smelling it though, I was actually pretty disappointed. I was really looking forward to the fruity smell, as that&#x27;s the typical perfumes I&#x27;m attracted to, but didn&#x27;t smell that at all. To me personally, it was very powdery and I immediately remembered reading a review that said it has a drug store perfume smell. I have to agree. I remember playing with cheap perfumes when I was younger and this brought me right back to those memories. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s not anything I would wear. For the price, it&#x27;s not a big deal. I ordered it on a whim without smelling it, so I can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;ll find someone who will like this as it&#x27;s a very common smelling perfume. So hey, I guess I ordered a gift for someone? :)</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this and loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; vanilla scent. It is much more of a night fragrance over meow. I prefer it.</li>
            <li> Great deal very happy</li>
            <li> Got it for granddaughter, she loved it and Mom approved of gentle essence!</li>
            <li> A really good deal compared to what I would&#x27;ve spent at a department store. Shipping took longer than expected due to USPS error not seller. They tracked down my package when my tracking for the item  did not work and were going to ship me a replacement  but luckily they were able to find it. Happy with product and purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sooo happy when i received purr! It was packaged accordingly so the product was in great condition. The perfume has a great scent just the right amount of sweetness and lasting power is terrific. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BOTTLE. Perfume smells great too :D</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is great to wear for both day and night. My friends love it too. The bottle is really pretty and it is really a big volume for such a great price. The only negative thing is that the fragrance could last a little longer, but I guess that can be fixed by taking it with you if you have a really long day ahead and want to keep smelling nice till the end of it :)</li>
            <li> loves cats.&lt;br /&gt;loves the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;loves the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend the perfume to all of her friends and family.</li>
