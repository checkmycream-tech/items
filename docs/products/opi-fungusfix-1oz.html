    <ol>
            <li>This product works excellent!  </li>
            <li>I have used this and proud to say that it WORKS!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful experience.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product, nothing else i gave tried has worked as well,</li>
            <li>I have been using the OPI FungusFix for many years (I have acrylic fingernails) and have found it to be the best product on the market for quickly resolving and eliminating any fungus uprising on your finger or toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as directed for months and after that I even tried using it more than directed hoping that would help.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews.</li>
            <li>Imagine sticking your precious feet in a jet-streaming tub that has been used by every joe schmoe that walks in asking for a pedi.</li>
            <li>I still have ways to go to a completely healthy nail, but I see the difference.</li>
            <li>Also note that for someone I know with more severe nail fungus, it isnt really helping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My toes will be ready for the sun this summer... :)</li>
            <li>This started working quickly for my husband.</li>
            <li>I tried some products that didn&#x27;t work as quick as this product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I got it right away</li>
            <li>Works very very well.</li>
            <li>- so doesn&#x27;t seem to working all that well at this time - maybe I have to finish it first - it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping me very much at this time.</li>
            <li>Though when applying at night, be aware that this product if you touch clothing with color etc, it can remove color - perhaps from chemicals/acid in the product?</li>
            <li>Given enough time and staying away from nail salons will do more than this product.</li>
            <li>now they are back to a pinkish flesh color and becoming smoother.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to be very drying to the nail which makes it very unattractive, too soon to give it any real rating.</li>
            <li>did not use it that much got called out of town</li>
            <li>He says it has worked better than any product he has previously used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a little more than a week.  </li>
            <li>He has a brand new toenail.</li>
            <li>The only anti fungus nail product I know that really</li>
            <li>This product fixed toe nail fungus</li>
            <li>Shook my feet back to normal!</li>
            <li>I suffered from mild fungal bacteria on my toenails due to getting pedicures at a local nail spa.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products to help my toenails heal and this is the first product that does the job it claims to.  </li>

            <li> The only anti fungus nail product I know that really works.&lt;br /&gt;And you do not need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy it again next time.</li>
            <li> This product fixed toe nail fungus I got from getting a pedicure in a salon. Though when applying at night, be aware that this product if you touch clothing with color etc, it can remove color - perhaps from chemicals/acid in the product? Also note that for someone I know with more severe nail fungus, it isnt really helping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it if you have this nail problem. It seems to work for some and not others.</li>
            <li> I have been using the OPI FungusFix for many years (I have acrylic fingernails) and have found it to be the best product on the market for quickly resolving and eliminating any fungus uprising on your finger or toe nails.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very very well. Tried other products and this one works!!! Don&#x27;t miss out. You have to use it everyday - maybe for months but be patient</li>
            <li> did not use it that much got called out of town but it seems to work well based on the limited time I used it</li>
            <li> Again, this product does nothing that leaving polish off your nails won&#x27;t do.  Given enough time and staying away from nail salons will do more than this product.</li>
            <li> This started working quickly for my husband. He has a brand new toenail. He&#x27;s tried other products with no success.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I&#x27;ve used it as directed for months and after that I even tried using it more than directed hoping that would help. It doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a little more than a week.  Seems to have made noticeable progress in a short time, although never having had toe fungus before, I am optimistic there may be a quicker recovery time using this product.</li>
            <li> This product has vastly improved my husband&#x27;s toe fungus.  He says it has worked better than any product he has previously used.</li>
            <li> OPI FungusFix&lt;br /&gt;Nail fungus does not disappear within a couple of weeks or even months, so I have been trying different products.  This one seems to be very drying to the nail which makes it very unattractive, too soon to give it any real rating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews. But I wanted to say something about this product.  I suffered from mild fungal bacteria on my toenails due to getting pedicures at a local nail spa.  Imagine sticking your precious feet in a jet-streaming tub that has been used by every joe schmoe that walks in asking for a pedi. EWWW! And as a result I got toenail fungus.  I tried some products that didn&#x27;t work as quick as this product.  I&#x27;ve applied the product almost daily (not consistent everyday), and I already see a major change of appearance in the color of my toenails.  Before the product my toenails had a yellow tint to them and the surface of the nail was abrasive...now they are back to a pinkish flesh color and becoming smoother.  I still have ways to go to a completely healthy nail, but I see the difference. I&#x27;ve had the product 3 weeks already.... My toes will be ready for the sun this summer... :)</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, nothing else i gave tried has worked as well,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experience the fix needed just yet - so doesn&#x27;t seem to working all that well at this time - maybe I have to finish it first - it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping me very much at this time.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent!  Shook my feet back to normal!</li>
            <li> I have used this and proud to say that it WORKS!  I even applied it over nail polish and no, it didn&#x27;t mess up the pedicure.  I have dealt with tis problem for years and now it&#x27;s gone.  It&#x27;s not a quick fix so be patient, it will take several months.</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This product actually works!  I&#x27;ve tried a few products to help my toenails heal and this is the first product that does the job it claims to.  Great!</li>
