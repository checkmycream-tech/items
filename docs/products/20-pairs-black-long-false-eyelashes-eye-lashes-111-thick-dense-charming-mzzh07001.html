            <li>Love them..</li>
            <li>I wear glasses most of the time</li>
            <li>Glad I could pay for something I never recieved.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Nice long and easy to apply- great dance lashes!</li>
            <li>When you blink they are shiny on top, looking a cheap quality.</li>
            <li>It would be great if most of the pairs came in the same style.  </li>
            <li>BUT THERE FINE IM</li>
            <li>looks fine.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit to lashes, always popping off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more pretty soon(:</li>
            <li>But hey there cute haha</li>
            <li>They came really quick befor the shipping date i would order them again</li>
            <li>They look pretty cheap looking, probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how i like them, very soft:)</li>
            <li>They are worth their price.</li>
            <li>Overall there nice lashes</li>
            <li>I LIked That They Were Long</li>
            <li>I love these, and purchased them in the 20 pack before I realized I could get 50 pairs for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Love them, very long and full, just like I hoped they would.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Only problem with it that is keeping me from giving a great review is the fact that the lash where the inside of the eye is, is all long...</li>
            <li>Nice doing business with you, just what expected.</li>
            <li>Good seller but, Not very good quality lashes.</li>
            <li>I always trim and curl all my new lashes or I double them to look like one pair, these lashes are easy to cut into the right look for my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky since I&#x27;m not used to wearing falsies but with a steady hand it gets easier and easier!</li>
            <li>I have and will recommend this product to anyone who wants or asks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes</li>
            <li>I was expecting the length to be much longer</li>
            <li>With the part that goes along the lash line being much longer than where the hair to the lashes even are (if that makes any sense).</li>
            <li>New eyelashes just arrived and I love them, they are long</li>
            <li>Cartoonishly long and cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I like to look sassy as I get older</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>the were pretty much the same as the stores I have been shopping at</li>
            <li>Excellent value, a little long on the ends, but nothing that a little trimming doesn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>So cheap not very useful.</li>
            <li>but I will splurge next time on a little bit more high quality product</li>
            <li>I bought at least six more pairs of these.</li>
            <li>so pretty sometimes I go for the super thick look and</li>
            <li>They are cheap synthetic and stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have not used them yet, they were thicker than I wanted, a little too bold for my face</li>
            <li>a little thin but great 20 pairs for the price</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel flimsy or.. for lack of a better word - weak?</li>
            <li>but nope they come fuller, and have that plastic fake look to them, plus installing them is a headache on it&#x27;s own, since they need to be cut/trim on the ends, and are so stiff, if you are not use to wearing lashes on a daily basis as i do you&#x27;ll notice right away the set back and the extra amount of time these lashes need as in addition to get them on fast.</li>
            <li>There cheap,  super false looking and stiff</li>
            <li>I do NOT like the fact that they are shiner than other brands that I normally use.  </li>

            <li> I do NOT like the fact that they are shiner than other brands that I normally use.  </li>
            <li> CHEAP AND STIFF DO WASTE MONEY, THREW THEM OUT</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like then, very thin and short, my sister enjoyed them though</li>
            <li> it doesnt go short to long.</li>
            <li> not as long as I would have hoped...</li>
            <li> Long just how I like my lashes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty and long but they&#x27;re stiff and hard to put on</li>
            <li> Love these lashes the strip is thin and not as noticeable will order them as long as I wear false lashes</li>
            <li> The only complaint would be that the lashes look longer in the picture and in the picture the lashes look the same length except shorter on the ends</li>
            <li> So I will definitely be reordering this item although I&#x27;m stocked up for at least 6 months if not longer.</li>
            <li> They arrived within 2 and an half wks.</li>
            <li> they wher long and thick just how i like them</li>
            <li> A few were slopply handmade.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the way I got my20 Pairs Black Long False...</li>
            <li> The only way I can wear them is if I cut the band and put pieces on individually, but they look so fake!</li>
            <li> Disappointed...flashes very stiff</li>
            <li> But the band on it is too hard.</li>
            <li> Really hard  and pokes me, even after lots of trimming.</li>
            <li> double them up but for the price you cannot go wrong !</li>
            <li> I honestly never wore false lashes before</li>
            <li> These are hard to apply, look fake and don&#x27;t glue well</li>
            <li> 20 pairs of false Eyelashes for under $5.00</li>
            <li> They are shiny and obviously fake.</li>
            <li> They look and feel plastic and look unrealistic .</li>
            <li> The band is too stiff to stay put on your eyelid!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes it almost impossible to put on it keep</li>
            <li> Worst fake lashes ever.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and plan on returning them for a refund. :(</li>
            <li> i noticed lint all along the base of the lash.</li>
            <li> Hate them.  </li>
            <li> Terrible !</li>

            <li> Disappointed...flashes very stiff</li>
            <li> Love these lashes the strip is thin and not as noticeable will order them as long as I wear false lashes</li>
            <li> These are great for the price!  not as long as I would have hoped...</li>
            <li> The Eyelashes are geeat! Quality product and sturdy enough to reuse.  20 pairs of false Eyelashes for under $5.00 That&#x27;s the price of one pair. So I will definitely be reordering this item although I&#x27;m stocked up for at least 6 months if not longer. Shipping takes a bit of time to get here but the savings alone outweighs the shipping length of time to get them.  I have and will recommend this product to anyone who wants or asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer,&lt;br /&gt;DaySun Thorndyke</li>
            <li> the lashes arrived, after 4 +weeks , i will say for the time i waited i&#x27;d thought for sure the lashes would come as shown on picture but nope they come fuller, and have that plastic fake look to them, plus installing them is a headache on it&#x27;s own, since they need to be cut/trim on the ends, and are so stiff, if you are not use to wearing lashes on a daily basis as i do you&#x27;ll notice right away the set back and the extra amount of time these lashes need as in addition to get them on fast.</li>
            <li> IVE  NOT TRIED THEM YET BUT THERE FINE IM SURE</li>
            <li> The band is too stiff to stay put on your eyelid!!!! They are shiny and obviously fake. The only way I can wear them is if I cut the band and put pieces on individually, but they look so fake!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> Worst fake lashes ever. They are worth their price.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness and length of these eyelashes.  I do NOT like the fact that they are shiner than other brands that I normally use.  In my opinion, they look like I got them at a dollar store.  When you blink they are shiny on top, looking a cheap quality. When your eyes are open they look grat. So its a love/hate relationship with them.  I prefer to spend more money on eyelashes that do look so oblivious that they are fake.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the way I got my20 Pairs Black Long False...</li>
            <li> Terrible ! DO NOT GRT THEM . They look and feel plastic and look unrealistic .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! But the band on it is too hard. It makes it almost impossible to put on it keep on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how they look though!</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes they are so pretty sometimes I go for the super thick look and double them up but for the price you cannot go wrong !</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I never received them.</li>
            <li> Excellent value, a little long on the ends, but nothing that a little trimming doesn&#x27;t fix. Nice long and easy to apply- great dance lashes!</li>
            <li> Lashes looked beautiful in packaging but once i removed one of the lashes i noticed lint all along the base of the lash. As I inspected further, all the lashes has it and i wasn&#x27;t able to remove the lint as it was stuck to the lashes. I was disappointed and plan on returning them for a refund. :(</li>
            <li> They are cheap synthetic and stiff.  What did I expect?  I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I LIked That They Were Long ( As The Description Says ) And I Got All 20 . I Wish They Wouldve Come Sooner Though.</li>
            <li> These lashes are wonderful the I can reuse them as needed... When I remove the clue for reapplying they do not fall apart!!!! Am very happy highly recommend them💋</li>
            <li> I love these they are perfect &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They came really quick befor the shipping date i would order them again they wher long and thick just how i like them</li>
            <li> like the product. like the way they look on me. thank U</li>
            <li> I love them! They look amazing and easy to apply (I use the Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive). It&#x27;s a bit tricky since I&#x27;m not used to wearing falsies but with a steady hand it gets easier and easier! They don&#x27;t feel flimsy or.. for lack of a better word - weak? Would def recommend!</li>
            <li> New eyelashes just arrived and I love them, they are long but that&#x27;s ok that&#x27;s how i like them, very soft:)</li>
            <li> CHEAP AND STIFF DO WASTE MONEY, THREW THEM OUT</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick or come with glue. But hey there cute haha</li>
            <li> These are hard to apply, look fake and don&#x27;t glue well</li>
            <li> Not what i was expecting, even dor synthetic lashes. Won&#x27;t fit to lashes, always popping off.</li>
            <li> Some of the eyelashes don&#x27;t match... but I love that I can peel the glue off and re use them for weeks</li>
            <li> Love them.. Long just how I like my lashes..sexy to.. Can&#x27;t wait to put them on😍😍</li>
            <li> These lashes are very, very nice I wear glasses most of the time and I like to look sassy as I get older and these lashes are perfect...</li>
            <li> Received my order almost a week before I thought I would. Love them, very long and full, just like I hoped they would. 20 of them came and they were in great condition.</li>
            <li> They were shipped quickly and it was a good price for the 20 pairs. The only complaint would be that the lashes look longer in the picture and in the picture the lashes look the same length except shorter on the ends but they&#x27;re shorter actually shorter on the one end and then get longer</li>
            <li> I never recur bed these...guess I&#x27;ll never know. They hit my card though. Glad I could pay for something I never recieved.</li>
            <li> Good seller but, Not very good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> Really hard  and pokes me, even after lots of trimming. Needs lots of regluing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the length to be much longer the were pretty much the same as the stores I have been shopping at will try again later maybe I will get what I needed they were a nice texture though</li>
            <li> I love these, and purchased them in the 20 pack before I realized I could get 50 pairs for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> So cheap not very useful. Not like the ones you buy at CVS they are thin and honestly so cheap</li>
            <li> Love love love these lashes, excellent quality and durable.  I always trim and curl all my new lashes or I double them to look like one pair, these lashes are easy to cut into the right look for my eyes. I recommend them highly. I definitely would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Received today &amp; when I opened them, a couple were ripped. They look pretty cheap looking, probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet, they were thicker than I wanted, a little too bold for my face</li>
            <li> For the price these are good. A few were slopply handmade. With the part that goes along the lash line being much longer than where the hair to the lashes even are (if that makes any sense). Overall I&#x27;m satisfied. Only problem with it that is keeping me from giving a great review is the fact that the lash where the inside of the eye is, is all long...it doesnt go short to long. But still for the price I can manage!</li>
            <li> It would be great if most of the pairs came in the same style.  Plus I would recommend use with a good adhesive.</li>
            <li> Hate them.  Cartoonishly long and cheap feeling.  It&#x27;s a good deal if u wear lashes often but I will splurge next time on a little bit more high quality product</li>
            <li> My lashes are here yay!!!!!</li>
            <li> They arrived within 2 and an half wks. Overall there nice lashes a little thin but great 20 pairs for the price</li>
            <li> For 20 lashes and the price, can&#x27;t beat it. I bought at least six more pairs of these. I will never but lashes from a store again</li>
            <li> looks fine.  worrth the price.&lt;br /&gt;was actually hoping for something bigger and fuller</li>
            <li> There cheap,  super false looking and stiff</li>
            <li> I honestly never wore false lashes before but honestly they are really beautiful I love them I&#x27;m going to order more pretty soon(:</li>
            <li> Nice doing business with you, just what expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty and long but they&#x27;re stiff and hard to put on you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like then, very thin and short, my sister enjoyed them though</li>
