            <li>Best facial product ever!</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels after using it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had these two stubborn pimples for like a month or more.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very smooth after each use and very clean also.</li>
            <li>This hydrated clay is so much more convenient and easier than mixing powder clay with water to try and form a paste that can be easily and evenly applied to the face.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to wipe off</li>
            <li>I love how its natural and when you rinse it off your face feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>so I feel comfortable using this product</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my complexion more clear, and my skin looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>Ok, ladies,  how many products do we buy for our faces that go straight to the trash can after a couple of uses?</li>
            <li>And not expensive!!</li>
            <li>BUT LOVE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>I follow brushing with a light spritz of peppermint oil and voila, fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Wow, love how clean and refreshed my face feels after doing this!</li>
            <li>Not helpful if you have a targeted problem area, per se, but good for overall cleansing and maintenance.</li>
            <li>True mud mask for cleansing your face.</li>
            <li>Super watery.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I also love that this is a natural product without any added chemicals or additives - it&#x27;s just clay and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used for acne for years with success.</li>
            <li>So I ran outta my proactive solution and replacing it with a more natural, affordable routine.</li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin without making it too dry, which I love!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it to my face...</li>
            <li>I was using an extremely expensive  but wonderful mud pack that I can no longer afford.</li>
            <li>Thanks Redmond!</li>
            <li>First mask I have tried where I can see clearer pores.</li>
            <li>Ok this is gross</li>
            <li>This mask helped my face so much!</li>
            <li>about to run out of my first tube.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my face feeling clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>Probably need to get used too the intense tightness, cause the thicker the application the more tightens - feels kinda like every pore is getting vacuum pinched.</li>
            <li>&amp; I needed a little rejuvenation that a mask brings.&lt;br /&gt;This sounded like it might be ok and Voila!  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it is safe for all skin types, as my skin is sometimes dry</li>
            <li>Finally decided to give it a shot and go the easy route with already hydrated clay.</li>
            <li>I use once every few weeks and love the way it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this one up quite quickly and definitely will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural product with only two ingredients.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to those looking for a better and natural solution for cleansing your face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But so far I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It works effectively without being to harsh on the skin, and as someone whose skin is sensitive I really like that about it.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few more times since and each time it gets easier cuz my face doesn&#x27;t need as much pulling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>I also intend to use it on bug bites and such, as others on here have mentioned success</li>
            <li>I started a new medication this year which makes me break out periodically.  </li>
            <li>Works well to shrink my pores and it does seem to help with acne outbreaks especially during a certain time of the month.</li>
            <li>All natural is what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li>I have found that if I use this mask when my skin is in the middle of a breakout, it seems to help sooth and reduce the breakout, and makes any existing blemishes heal and subside much faster.  </li>
            <li>I bought this 3 days ago at my local health food store when I spotted it on the very bottom shelf.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found a natural facial mask that I can feel good about using without all of those nasty harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>There are only a couple really stubborn ones left</li>
            <li>Following this mask with a natural moisturizer has done wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li>but other times is oily in certain areas and</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, helped to shrink my pores, and helped to clear out any upcoming breakouts.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> my batch was a little thin textured  thicken it up with more clay in future batches</li>
            <li> I barely made it 5 minutes because it was pulling so tight.</li>
            <li> But u don&#x27;t want to let it get too dry.</li>
            <li> I leave it on until totally dry and cracking and then wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I decided it was just too harsh for my skin and starting to cause wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> 3 days later, 90% of the pimples are dried up and gone.</li>
            <li> though it is already mixed with water, I add a splash of organic apple cider vinegar and about a teaspoon of plain yogurt.</li>
            <li> also, my daughter got eaten up by Mosquitos the other day</li>
            <li> even use it on my legs and arms for a little exhilaration.</li>
            <li> Every day a new deep, painful pimple was surfacing.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Redmond Healing Clay.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t hurt anymore and some redness from the ones that dried up but that will be gone over time.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> They were deep and I messed with them all the time but did nothing but make them worse.</li>
            <li> A little hard getting used to the amount you need to use for an application.</li>
            <li> Over the past month I have tried everything that anyone recommended and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses it was gone!</li>
            <li> Now in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My skin went from clear to covered with horrible, painful acne.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE quality!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this face mask. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love how its natural and when you rinse it off your face feels amazing.  I will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my skin. It tightened everything up and refreshed nicely. Not helpful if you have a targeted problem area, per se, but good for overall cleansing and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! All natural is what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li> This hydrated clay is so much more convenient and easier than mixing powder clay with water to try and form a paste that can be easily and evenly applied to the face. I love that it is a natural product with only two ingredients. I also appreciate that it is safe for all skin types, as my skin is sometimes dry but other times is oily in certain areas and occasionally acne prone- so I feel comfortable using this product no matter the current conditions of my face. It works effectively without being to harsh on the skin, and as someone whose skin is sensitive I really like that about it.</li>
            <li> This product is Facial Mud Hydrated Clay. I haven&#x27;t used this product enough yet. But so far I like it very much. A little hard getting used to the amount you need to use for an application. Skin feels very smooth after each use and very clean also. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works well to shrink my pores and it does seem to help with acne outbreaks especially during a certain time of the month. Very Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, really draws out toxins and helps healing. This company also has great Earthpaste (toothpaste) in several wonderful flavors.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Redmond&#x27;s Facial Mud is my go to facial cleaning product.  It cleans my skin without making it too dry, which I love!</li>
            <li> This stuff works to tighten face and for pores. The first time I applied it to my face...I barely made it 5 minutes because it was pulling so tight. It was agony.. Couldn&#x27;t move my face...itchy.I looked like a monster in the mirror where it pulled my face up. I have used it a few more times since and each time it gets easier cuz my face doesn&#x27;t need as much pulling. I can go 1/2 hour now cuz I don&#x27;t feel like getting up to wash it off. But u don&#x27;t want to let it get too dry.</li>
            <li> I started a new medication this year which makes me break out periodically.  I have found that if I use this mask when my skin is in the middle of a breakout, it seems to help sooth and reduce the breakout, and makes any existing blemishes heal and subside much faster.  I am now using it about twice a week.  It also seems to make my skin smoother and to reduce the appearance of the pores.  I also love that this is a natural product without any added chemicals or additives - it&#x27;s just clay and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as part of a prize basket I won and am very happy that it was included.  I like it a lot and will be purchasing some when this initial tube runs out.</li>
            <li> This is really amazing stuff. My pores are smaller, my complexion more clear, and my skin looks beautiful! Following this mask with a natural moisturizer has done wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> Does the J O B! Probably need to get used too the intense tightness, cause the thicker the application the more tightens - feels kinda like every pore is getting vacuum pinched.</li>
            <li> SHARED WITH MY DAUGHTERS AS WELL. WE ALL LOVE IT. WISH IT WAS THICKER THOUGH. BUT LOVE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of bentonite clay before but never used it. Finally decided to give it a shot and go the easy route with already hydrated clay. Oh my...my skin feels so good afterwards! It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, helped to shrink my pores, and helped to clear out any upcoming breakouts. LOVE IT!! I am so happy to have found a natural facial mask that I can feel good about using without all of those nasty harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies,  how many products do we buy for our faces that go straight to the trash can after a couple of uses? I was using an extremely expensive  but wonderful mud pack that I can no longer afford. I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper stuff before &amp; just threw money away. My skin was beginning to show some effects of the summer weather &amp; I needed a little rejuvenation that a mask brings.&lt;br /&gt;This sounded like it might be ok and Voila!  Your skin feels tingly, feels smoother &amp; looks much more supple after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my legs and arms for a little exhilaration. I&#x27;ll be using this one up quite quickly and definitely will be back for more. Thanks Redmond!</li>
            <li> Clears up any acne issues I have</li>
            <li> Wow, love how clean and refreshed my face feels after doing this! Definitely recommend to those looking for a better and natural solution for cleansing your face. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> True mud mask for cleansing your face. I also use it as a spot treatment for any acne I get and it works great at drawing out any toxins.</li>
            <li> i take the clay pills for intestinal cleansing and love this mask my batch was a little thin textured  thicken it up with more clay in future batches it seemed too watery</li>
            <li> First mask I have tried where I can see clearer pores. So glad I gave it a try. Highly recommend for combination/oily skin. Mine is combination. I just received by 2nd tube and am seeing smaller, clearer pores.</li>
            <li> Healing stuff!  I have used for acne for years with success.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE quality! Super watery. No abrasive or mud texture.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for years. Now in my late 30&#x27;s I decided it was just too harsh for my skin and starting to cause wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;After rave reviews I decided to try the Oil Cleansing Method...with disasterous results. My skin went from clear to covered with horrible, painful acne. Over the past month I have tried everything that anyone recommended and nothing worked. Every day a new deep, painful pimple was surfacing.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Redmond Healing Clay. I bought this 3 days ago at my local health food store when I spotted it on the very bottom shelf. 3 days later, 90% of the pimples are dried up and gone. There are only a couple really stubborn ones left but they don&#x27;t hurt anymore and some redness from the ones that dried up but that will be gone over time.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is already mixed with water, I add a splash of organic apple cider vinegar and about a teaspoon of plain yogurt. I leave it on until totally dry and cracking and then wash it off in the shower. Follow with a good moisturizer as it is drying. I also take a bit from the tube and spot treat overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I saw this and decided to try it. I wish I would have know about it a month ago. I will definitely be using this as a regular part of my skin care.</li>
            <li> Best facial product ever! Excellent service!</li>
            <li> Yes! I love how smooth my skin feels after using it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to wipe off and it leaves my face feeling clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> So I ran outta my proactive solution and replacing it with a more natural, affordable routine. Ran across this lady&#x27;s blog and she raved about this stuff. Read a bunch of reviews and ordered it. I used it the night before last and Oh my gosh! It works at getting yucky stuff out!! Ok this is gross but I&#x27;ve had these two stubborn pimples for like a month or more. They were deep and I messed with them all the time but did nothing but make them worse. They wouldn&#x27;t pop. Gross, I know! Well, one use of this stuff and after I rinsed it off they were both whiteheads!! Ugh!!! But yayyy!! Now they are on their way to healing. Finally! My pores on my nose and chin look way cleaner! This stuff is awesome!! And not expensive!! ....also, my daughter got eaten up by Mosquitos the other day and I put this stuff in them and it took the itch away!! I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This mask helped my face so much! I struggled with some postpartum acne and used this once with noticeable differences. After just a few uses it was gone! I use once every few weeks and love the way it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients. I feel safe putting this on my face and my skin feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this stuff. Just clay and water. I use this as toothpaste, yes toothpaste (after trying Redmond&#x27;s Earthpaste but ending up less-than impressed). I follow brushing with a light spritz of peppermint oil and voila, fresh and clean smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a spot treatment mask overnight when I have a pimple or two and it definitely helps to diffuse them! I also intend to use it on bug bites and such, as others on here have mentioned success with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about to run out of my first tube. Will absolutely purchase again and again.</li>
