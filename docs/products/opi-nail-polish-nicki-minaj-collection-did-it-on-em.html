            <li>I love this color..</li>
            <li>I love this color..</li>
            <li>As always I love my OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the one I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and look forward to wearing in the winter months..</li>
            <li>I love this polish because I love Nicki Minaj.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I have, and I don&#x27;t want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it took so many coats to get it to the way you want it</li>
            <li>Bright, fun, sassy</li>
            <li>- I just love this color.</li>
            <li>I wish I had three more bottles of this color.</li>
            <li>its just what i expected it to be.. turned out perfectly when i got my nails done...</li>
            <li>Love the unique color.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous vibrant color</li>
            <li>Niece says it works fine.</li>
            <li>fantastic colour.</li>
            <li>but it is still fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>It is a popular trending vivid color.</li>
            <li>Same with the other finger nail polish that I had bought, I love the color and was happy the way it was safely shipped.</li>
            <li>Gardens\\&quot; from the Special Effects line of Nails, Inc. at Sephora, and was waiting for just the right time to use it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color and packaged well, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking in the mail!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a baby vomit/poop yellow &amp; the picture makes it look like a great neon green.</li>
            <li>The formula is great as OPI usually is.</li>
            <li>OPI is well worth the extra cents :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an avid OPI user like me, you&#x27;ll notice this color looks a lot like &#x27;Who the Shrek are you?&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love this color, yellow the color of the spring/summer season, 2012.  </li>
            <li>I love this color because its so different than anything else I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, the slightly more sedate shade got me thinking about spring, and Easter, and flowers, and because I never leave well enough alone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly the bright green, more of a pastel/avocado.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this polish as it seems to be so hard to find a nice bright green, however when it arrived it is not the color I expected, in fact I even double checked the name on the bottle to make sure they sent me the right product.</li>
            <li>I only used one light coat so as not to over-embellish the mani.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this color for the BOLD, because only the bold can pull this off!</li>
            <li>The color was slight lighter than the picture, i was expecting a more neon color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shade, as well as Princes Gardens</li>
            <li>not the green i was expecting it was more like a yallow</li>
            <li>Add in the white, light blue, and purple flecks and bam...instant spring field of wild flowers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll paint my nails, enjoy the color as it is for a few hours, or maybe even a day....</li>
            <li>I thought it would be much brighter (like a neon green), but It&#x27;s more of a grass green in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Since this was a Nicki Minaj shade I expected it to pop a little more, like she does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely green, with a yellow hue, but it&#x27;s more flat and reserved than a neon.  </li>
            <li>a little less bright yellow/green than I expected it to,</li>

            <li> a little less bright yellow/green than I expected it to,</li>
            <li> but anyway strange color</li>
            <li> The only thing about this color is it goes on thinner than I expected</li>
            <li> My nails were long when I put this color on.</li>
            <li> Not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> I have neon yellow and green</li>
            <li> The print on bottle is as a little bit different from other products.</li>
            <li> this color is so fun, but make sure each coat is thin aband give it time to dry, otherwise it&#x27;ll be an annoying tacky mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other brand...</li>
            <li> but maybe I need a better base coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will concur with other reviewers that this polish is a little thinner than I am used to from OPI.  </li>
            <li> It did chip less than 24 hours after I used it</li>
            <li> There happens to be some very small green flecks in it that is almost the same shade as this polish.  </li>
            <li> This is a lime green color.</li>
            <li> This polish is not as thick as other products I get from OPI.</li>
            <li> would recommend using a base coat and top coat because this polish is on the thin side.</li>
            <li> So I had to get at least three of them.</li>
            <li> and it needs 2-3 coats to look thick.</li>
            <li> I am afraid it is not a real OPI product.</li>
            <li> It is so runny...use a white base coat to make the color stick and pop otherwise be prepared for 20 coats.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be disappointed too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously disgusting!!</li>
            <li> It is an awful color.</li>

            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. fantastic colour. bright and fun!</li>
            <li> This citron shade is amazingly beautiful. It is a popular trending vivid color. Very nice pop of color. Perfect for the season.</li>
            <li> Niece says it works fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color &amp; it&#x27;s nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s more of a baby vomit/poop yellow &amp; the picture makes it look like a great neon green. Don&#x27;t buy it. You&#x27;ll be disappointed too. It&#x27;s also a LOT more runny than most OPI polishes. It&#x27;s seriously disgusting!! YUCK!!</li>
            <li> this color is so fun, but make sure each coat is thin aband give it time to dry, otherwise it&#x27;ll be an annoying tacky mess. love this, though :)</li>
            <li> OMG!! I love this color.. Received item on time...and the color is beautiful!!!!! I used this color with a neutral color and it looks great together!!</li>
            <li> I love this color.. its just what i expected it to be.. turned out perfectly when i got my nails done...</li>
            <li> As always I love my OPI nail polish. I don&#x27;t buy any other brand...I&#x27;ll stick to the one I love. OPI is well worth the extra cents :)</li>
            <li> my husbands says its like someone vomited on my nails, but anyway strange color, no one likes but for me nice</li>
            <li> great product...I&#x27;d recommend. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on the color.  I love the color and look forward to wearing in the winter months..</li>
            <li> Same with the other finger nail polish that I had bought, I love the color and was happy the way it was safely shipped.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. It goes on amazing. However, I&#x27;ve seen this color before. If you&#x27;re an avid OPI user like me, you&#x27;ll notice this color looks a lot like &#x27;Who the Shrek are you?&#x27; from the Shrek collection. It did chip less than 24 hours after I used it but maybe I need a better base coat. I&#x27;m going to do another coat when I get off work!</li>
            <li> This polish is not as thick as other products I get from OPI. The print on bottle is as a little bit different from other products. I am afraid it is not a real OPI product. But I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Color is good anyway.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and packaged well, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking in the mail! It&#x27;s a good quality polish.</li>
            <li> It is so runny...use a white base coat to make the color stick and pop otherwise be prepared for 20 coats.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! The color is gorgeous, but not as bright as displayed in the picture.  I love this nail polish! OPI always has amazing colors and always great quality.  The only thing about this color is it goes on thinner than I expected and it needs 2-3 coats to look thick. Very great though!</li>
            <li> I love this polish because I love Nicki Minaj. So I had to get at least three of them. I love love love the color.! And it&#x27;s OPI of course. Great!</li>
            <li> This is a lime green color. The formula is great as OPI usually is. My nails were long when I put this color on. After about 5 days I decided to stretch out the wear and put white french tips on and a white design on only 1 nails per hand. Everyone loved it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this color for the BOLD, because only the bold can pull this off! (;</li>
            <li> Love this color, yellow the color of the spring/summer season, 2012.  I think i bought about 2 shades of yellow already.  Go OPI!</li>
            <li> good polish and good color. would recommend using a base coat and top coat because this polish is on the thin side. probably would need 2 or 3 coats. i gave it a 4 star because of the extra polish needed. thank you.</li>
            <li> Not the color I expected. I thought it would be much brighter (like a neon green), but It&#x27;s more of a grass green in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The color was slight lighter than the picture, i was expecting a more neon color. Still a very nice color!!!!!</li>
            <li> Color looks nothing like the picture. It is an awful color.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best.  Love the unique color.  Great for spring and summer.  It looks especially good on the toes.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous vibrant color</li>
            <li> I love this color because its so different than anything else I have. It&#x27;s a funky kinda greenish slightly yellow sort of color. Thats the best way I can explain a color like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never one to leave a polish alone.  I&#x27;ll paint my nails, enjoy the color as it is for a few hours, or maybe even a day....and then I start embellishing it.  It&#x27;s a sickness.  But then so is my nail polish collection.  I don&#x27;t know how many I have, and I don&#x27;t want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Did it on &#x27;em\\&quot; came out a little less bright yellow/green than I expected it to, but it is still fantastic.  I have neon yellow and green so I didn&#x27;t need another.  It&#x27;s definitely green, with a yellow hue, but it&#x27;s more flat and reserved than a neon.  Since this was a Nicki Minaj shade I expected it to pop a little more, like she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the slightly more sedate shade got me thinking about spring, and Easter, and flowers, and because I never leave well enough alone I started looking for a proper accent coat.  I picked up \\&quot;Princes Gardens\\&quot; from the Special Effects line of Nails, Inc. at Sephora, and was waiting for just the right time to use it.  There happens to be some very small green flecks in it that is almost the same shade as this polish.  Add in the white, light blue, and purple flecks and bam...instant spring field of wild flowers.  I only used one light coat so as not to over-embellish the mani.  Just a sprinkling. I wish I could get a good pic to add to this review.  Fantastic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will concur with other reviewers that this polish is a little thinner than I am used to from OPI.  However 2 coats still gave me a solid opaque finish that matched the bottle.  No issues there.  Highly recommend this shade, as well as Princes Gardens</li>
            <li> not the green i was expecting it was more like a yallow and it took so many coats to get it to the way you want it</li>
            <li> Bright, fun, sassy - I just love this color. I wish I had three more bottles of this color. OPI never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this polish as it seems to be so hard to find a nice bright green, however when it arrived it is not the color I expected, in fact I even double checked the name on the bottle to make sure they sent me the right product. It&#x27;s not nearly the bright green, more of a pastel/avocado.</li>
