            <li>There could be many reasons for this.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a lotion than an oil...</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for 3 years now and have had the best, longest lasting tan that I ever had.  </li>
            <li>and I burn easily.</li>
            <li>It contains light mineral oil, kukui nut oil, vitamins E, C &amp; A, Kona coffee plant extract, aloe, and potassium iodide.</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL.  </li>
            <li>my skin has a great brown tone to it now when it normally has a red tint to it ,, will definitly order more</li>

            <li>I first tried this in Hawaii, used what I had purchased there and couldn&#x27;t go the rest of the summer without more, thanks for carrying it.....</li>

            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE REAL MAUI BABE BROWNING LOTION.  </li>
            <li>I am a blonde with moderately light skin (although I do tan).  </li>
            <li>BEEN USING THE ORIGINAL FOR SEVERAL YEARS</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /</li>

            <li>Research shows that coffee protects skin from damage and the Hawaiian nut oils have been used for a few centuries with success...  </li>
            <li>(less solid) right in your hand.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying, because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin---so slightly that it&#x27;s really not noticeable (unlike a stain or self</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 yrs now it is the only lotion that gives me a deep dark tan as I am a red head and its hard for me to tan</li>

            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER USE IT BECAUSE IT STINKS DOES NOT STAY ON SKIN AND HAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN IT.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does seem like a fake ( remake) of Maui babe.</li>

            <li> I have used this for several years and I love it.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast it came.</li>
            <li> i use this product when i lay out by the pool ... my skin has a great brown tone to it now when it normally has a red tint to it ,, will definitly order more</li>
            <li> Must admit, that I don&#x27;t use this...being very pale and I burn easily. My husband loves to tan and rarely burns, so this is his ideal lotion. This purchase was made for German friends who fell in love with this lotion while here! I know you can combine this WITH sunscreen, so maybe I will try that...</li>
            <li> I found this product in Hawaii over a decade ago and now it is the only tanning lotion I like to use.  Great for the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion used to get me so tan.....not sure what is different....but I am not seeing the same long lasting effects it once had. There could be many reasons for this. It could be my skin, the sun.....who knows!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!  It comes out of the bottle brown and takes no time to get a tan.  Everyone asks me where I&#x27;ve been to get so tan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff its amazing indoors or out</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;I found out about Maui Babe during a recent vacation to Hawaii. Initially I thought it was very expensive, but after using it, I changed my mind. A little goes a long way, it smells wonderful, moisturizes great, and this was the first trip that I didn&#x27;t burn at all---just got a great tan. I used Maui Babe to moisturize my skin during the day and to help me tan instead of burn, and then one last time after a shower at night, even though I wouldn&#x27;t be going into the sun again, because it just feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maui Babe has to be shaken up to disperse all of the different ingredients. Then when it comes out it immediately starts to sort of \\&quot;melt\\&quot; or get liquidy (less solid) right in your hand. It contains light mineral oil, kukui nut oil, vitamins E, C &amp; A, Kona coffee plant extract, aloe, and potassium iodide. The dominant smell is coffee and nut butter---really wonderful smell for men or women. All ingredients are Hawaiian and the lotion is made in Wailuku, Maui.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on the back says that it is the aloe that helps prevent burning, and of course, it soothes the skin after being in the sun, too. The label says that it is \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; (because of the oil, I&#x27;m guessing). The label also says that it can be used with all sunscreens and as a \\&quot;tan accelerant\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying, because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin---so slightly that it&#x27;s really not noticeable (unlike a stain or self-tanner)---but enough so that it will get on your clothes. So just rub it in very well, and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I will buy it again and again. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever !!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does seem like a fake ( remake) of Maui babe. I have used this product for a few years now ( since I have lived in Hawaii) and this is NO where near what I had been using! It&#x27;s more like a lotion than an oil...it streeks white when you get in the water &amp; runs right off. I will not buy from here again....very disappointed :/</li>
            <li> Natural Hawaiian nut oils and coffees that protect the skin and promote the best tans ever!  It is oily and a prissy mainlander probably will whine about that but the fool is on you.  Research shows that coffee protects skin from damage and the Hawaiian nut oils have been used for a few centuries with success...  Can&#x27;t beat nature.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff in Hawaii years ago and started getting it on Amazon thereafter....it works so well...highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE REAL MAUI BABE BROWNING LOTION.  I WISH I WOULD OF SPENT THE EXTRA FOUR DOLLARS A BOTTLE AND RECEVIED THE ORIGINAL.  THE CONSISTENCY,SMELL,FEEL OF THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.IVE BEEN USING THE ORIGINAL FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I LOVE IT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER USE IT BECAUSE IT STINKS DOES NOT STAY ON SKIN AND HAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN IT.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion out there. Wish it smelled a little better. Kind reminds me of soy sauce, but gets me super brown!</li>
            <li> Only Tanning Lotion you Will Ever Need!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Best!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 yrs now it is the only lotion that gives me a deep dark tan as I am a red head and its hard for me to tan but this works!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for 3 years now and have had the best, longest lasting tan that I ever had.  I am a blonde with moderately light skin (although I do tan).  I lay out once every couple of weeks and look like I have been to the beach.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this in Hawaii, used what I had purchased there and couldn&#x27;t go the rest of the summer without more, thanks for carrying it.....</li>
