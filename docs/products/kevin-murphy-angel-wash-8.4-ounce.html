            <li>After reading some reviews I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people with fine hair and at the same time protects you hair color.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and hopefully it will continue to be available online.  </li>
            <li>no point in spending a ton of money to keep my hair blonde and pretty if i am not going to use good products to keep it looking nice!</li>
            <li>Comes in super safe packaging too</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product as I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great - and to have a shampoo/conditioner actually give it body - that&#x27;s a miracle!  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that I can use and Amazon gives great service.</li>
            <li>I have since found a review where the user&lt;br /&gt;had experienced the same problem after using this product.  </li>
            <li>the in the Kevin Murphy bottle, the shampoo is much thicker and soaps up much more easily.</li>
            <li>Hair is so healthy looking after blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle shampoo!</li>
            <li>it gives one a feeling of clean tranquility.</li>
            <li>I just wish the pricec was more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I used and the results were less good than now, when I&#x27;ve learned to be more generous in the amount of Angel Rinse</li>
            <li>I would also note that it doesn&#x27;t have any parabens or other chemicals, so if you are nursing or just worried about using products that could harm baby, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>Okay I obviously have more words than that</li>
            <li>This product can&#x27;t be beat for making my limp, ultra straight and fine hair - looking good!  </li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that need volume</li>
            <li>This one was a little on the runny side, but still great.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle, light shampoo for color treated hair</li>
            <li>It was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used Kevin Murphy hair products for several years and have liked the results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, shiny and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>If you want the real product, full strength, don&#x27;t order it from this company.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My hair started falling out when he was 2 months old - and this is for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I intentionally didn&#x27;t put any other product in to see how my hair would fare today and was really surprised and happy to find the product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which I love because I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product but slow shipping and shampoo had spilled inside the sealed bag during shipment.</li>
            <li>and I first purchased it at my hairdressers.  </li>
            <li>However, my most recent order seemed diluted.  </li>
            <li>I use it because it preserves color a lot better and for longer than regular shampoos that just strip away color after just a use.  </li>
            <li>This does not create a lather unless you use a VERY LARGE amount which is very upsetting considering the price of the product.</li>
            <li>I use it when my hair feels too dry and it makes it feel so silky and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Someone is opening the package, diluting it and adding back the heat sealer (which is easy to do with an iron).  </li>
            <li>I have very short fine hair that is colored.  </li>
            <li>and they are much thicker there.  </li>
            <li>Also, I used to really skimp on the amount of conditioner (Angel Rinse)</li>
            <li>Found it available on line after I left the salon</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much difference</li>
            <li>I ended up washing my hair with a different shampoo and conditioner again after using this as the angel wash and rinse just does not make my hair feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I try to use only special occasion .</li>
            <li>My hair is a short asymmetrical bob I have colored a vibrant purple and this wash had my hair looking full of volume, shiny and glam all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone looking to vamp up their hair.</li>
            <li>I normally get it from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>No great savings price wise over buying at a salon, it was just a convenience to order via Amazon</li>
            <li>I saw some negative reviews about this product not lathering well, so I wanted to write a positive review for it because I really do love this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I keep trying other, more expensive brands, thinking maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be using \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; product - but its amazing</li>
            <li>After my first use of the Kevin Murphy Angel Wash, my hair color was left a very unattractive overall orange color,&lt;br /&gt;where</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been any shiner, had any more volume, nor has my blonde been any less \\&quot;damaged\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and use about a quarter sized dollop to soap up - it&#x27;s enough to get my hair feeling clean after I dry it even though it may not lather up a lot like in those Herbal Essences commercials.  </li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair too soft and therefore not manegable..</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair as a result, looks and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>After having chemo and not having my hair come back really</li>
            <li>It really added a lot of volume to my hair, and even now as my hair is growing back, I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Completely.</li>
            <li>It gives me lots of body without making my hair too soft.</li>
            <li>With this order the soap was thin and watered down, I had to use much more to get full lather.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that keeps my hair soft but not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they should market it as such, but all in all, I have colored thick hair, I am in my 50s and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this helps not weighing it down!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perhaps they should market it as such, but all in all, I have colored thick hair, I am in my 50s and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this helps not weighing it down!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is generally lifeless halfway through the day if I don&#x27;t use product and gets extremely static-y this time of year</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievabley luxurious product for fine thin hair that needs a boost!</li>
            <li> With shine and body and a little bit of lift, the hair hangs so naturally.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners, and don&#x27;t get the same result.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair, frizzy curly, and I always straighten it.</li>
            <li> I am always in the sun, pool, ocean and dry / straighten my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> it is totally watered down to being runny.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to only use a little bit of each product.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but so worth it...</li>
            <li> I had read in other reviews</li>
            <li> (see other review on the conditioner)  </li>
            <li> With these products I need at least a quarter size (especially in the shampoo - it just does NOT lather well).  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair with one platinum streak.  </li>
            <li> but cost less</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low in sulates (which is an ingredient that gets products to lather up), so that may explain why some people have issues with the decrease in suds, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that this shampoo isn&#x27;t doing its job of cleaning your hair!  </li>
            <li> When they first arrived I was a little shocked at how small/thin</li>
            <li> It is normally pink and very thick in consistency.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy mine at my hair salon</li>
            <li> Be careful while ordering and don&#x27;t get the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I did this and the company that sold it was ever so rude</li>
            <li> Like my review for AnGel rinse, I am not happy with the smell or the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it even if it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I can no longer recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Very thin - when purchased at a salon</li>
            <li> Suggested by my stylist - if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li> and it was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Between the cost of the Wash and&lt;br /&gt;the Rinse and the colorist, this will prove to have been a very expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever.  </li>

            <li> This was recommended by my salon since I just had a keratin straitening. It has plenty of suds but it leaves my hair too soft and therefore not manegable..I am still looking for a good shampoo that can be used on keratin straightened hiar.</li>
            <li> Love all kevin Murphy products.  I usually buy mine at my hair salon and they are much thicker there.  This one was a little on the runny side, but still great.</li>
            <li> This product can&#x27;t be beat for making my limp, ultra straight and fine hair - looking good!  With shine and body and a little bit of lift, the hair hangs so naturally.  It often looks better if I don&#x27;t put any products in it, after using the Angel Wash and Angel Rinse in tandem!  Make sure to use the conditioner with it - I have tried other conditioners, and don&#x27;t get the same result.  Also, I used to really skimp on the amount of conditioner (Angel Rinse) I used and the results were less good than now, when I&#x27;ve learned to be more generous in the amount of Angel Rinse I use following Angel Wash.  My hair looks great - and to have a shampoo/conditioner actually give it body - that&#x27;s a miracle!  Plus, my hair as a result, looks and feels soft.  A great product.</li>
            <li> Great product but slow shipping and shampoo had spilled inside the sealed bag during shipment.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with fine hair and at the same time protects you hair color.</li>
            <li> After having chemo and not having my hair come back really like it was before. I am in a constant fret regarding my hair. This is the only product that I can use and Amazon gives great service. Be careful while ordering and don&#x27;t get the wrong product. I did this and the company that sold it was ever so rude and it was unpleasant. It had nothing to do with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever.  No lather and my hair felt dirtier after washing.</li>
            <li> Though I will agree that there is not a lot of &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; when you wash with this product, that is all commercial hype. You should use dish soap if you want lather and not care about your hair. Try the  Wen shampoo which everyone supposedly raves about and there is NO lather. Perhaps they should market it as such, but all in all, I have colored thick hair, I am in my 50s and this product is fantastic. If  someone is watering the product, that is an issue, but the product is wonderful if  you get it as it is suppose to be. Leaves my hair soft, shiny, clean, doesn&#x27;t strip the color, and just is the best I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy....</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and hopefully it will continue to be available online.  My hair is very thin and fine.  It behaves much better when I use this product.  My beautician used to buy it for me in Des Moines but she can no longer find it locally</li>
            <li> You will love this shampoo, I use the conditioner as well.  Hair is so healthy looking after blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and it makes me look like I have lots of volume.  I have to be careful to only use a little bit of each product.</li>
            <li> Very thin - when purchased at a salon the in the Kevin Murphy bottle, the shampoo is much thicker and soaps up much more easily. With this order the soap was thin and watered down, I had to use much more to get full lather. No great savings price wise over buying at a salon, it was just a convenience to order via Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo (and conditioner) after I had my child. My hair started falling out when he was 2 months old - and this is for fine hair. It really added a lot of volume to my hair, and even now as my hair is growing back, I will continue to use this. I have dry hair, frizzy curly, and I always straighten it. I highly recommend this product. As well, it is great for color treated hair. I would also note that it doesn&#x27;t have any parabens or other chemicals, so if you are nursing or just worried about using products that could harm baby, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> After my first use of the Kevin Murphy Angel Wash, my hair color was left a very unattractive overall orange color,&lt;br /&gt;where prior to the wash it had been a medium blonde with highlights.  I have since found a review where the user&lt;br /&gt;had experienced the same problem after using this product.  My colorist will now have to attempt to restore my&lt;br /&gt;hair color to what it was prior to my using the Kevin Murphy Angel Wash.  Between the cost of the Wash and&lt;br /&gt;the Rinse and the colorist, this will prove to have been a very expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> Three words. Mind.Completely.Blown! Okay I obviously have more words than that but after only one use of this product along with the rinse, I am a convert. My hair is generally lifeless halfway through the day if I don&#x27;t use product and gets extremely static-y this time of year but this wash did things to my hair I have only dreamed of. My hair is a short asymmetrical bob I have colored a vibrant purple and this wash had my hair looking full of volume, shiny and glam all day. I intentionally didn&#x27;t put any other product in to see how my hair would fare today and was really surprised and happy to find the product actually does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and my scalp felt and looked great all day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to vamp up their hair. It was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Getting the conditioner next!!! I am very happy!! I have fine hair and this helps not weighing it down!!!! Great product</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo !!! Gives volume !!  I wish this shampoo wasn&#x27;t  $$$$$  I try to use only special occasion .</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years</li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for colored hair and I first purchased it at my hairdressers.  Found it available on line after I left the salon</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews I was very excited to try this product. I got the shampoo and the conditioner (rinse).  When they first arrived I was a little shocked at how small/thin the bottles were for the price (see photo up top).  I had read in other reviews you only need a tiny bit however so I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, in my \\&quot;old\\&quot; product I only needed about a nickle-sized amount of shampoo and conditioner.  With these products I need at least a quarter size (especially in the shampoo - it just does NOT lather well).  My hair is a chin length bob so it shouldn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I haven&#x27;t seen any vast improvement.  I have dark hair with one platinum streak.  My hair hasn&#x27;t been any shiner, had any more volume, nor has my blonde been any less \\&quot;damaged\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve used everything from Fekkai to Bumble &amp; Bumble to grocery store care, the BEST shampoo and conditioner for fine hair I&#x27;ve ever found is Garnier Length &amp; Strength.  I keep trying other, more expensive brands, thinking maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be using \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; product - but its amazing and I&#x27;ll go back after this is all gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Thanks for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was the price.</li>
            <li> I use this and the rinse together.  It doesn&#x27;t wash out the color as some shampoos tend to do.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the price.  I will continue to use it even if it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Love the products , makes my hair feel thicker . Would recommend this to everyone who needs their hair to look and feel fuller .</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product as I have fine hair. It gives me lots of body without making my hair too soft. Also, the fragrance is amazing- it gives one a feeling of clean tranquility.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Suggested by my stylist - if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li> I liked it when I used it, but I&#x27;m not coloring my hair anymore</li>
            <li> Like my review for AnGel rinse, I am not happy with the smell or the way it makes my hair feel.  I will finish out the bottle, but don&#x27;t plan on re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo, I no longer have problems with electricity in my hair!</li>
            <li> Same stuff but cost less I have fine straight hair that need volume&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my stylist but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much difference</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!  I use it when my hair feels too dry and it makes it feel so silky and smooth!  I also love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have used Kevin Murphy hair products for several years and have liked the results.  However, my most recent order seemed diluted.  It also doesn&#x27;t lather.  Very disappointing.  Sorry to say that I can no longer recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  If you are looking for a gentle, light shampoo for color treated hair this is it.  It leaves my hair clean, shiny and very manageable.  Of course I use the Angel Wash as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works wonderfully. Hair feels amazing. Comes in super safe packaging too</li>
            <li> I have very fine bleach blonde hair. I am always in the sun, pool, ocean and dry / straighten my hair all the time. This is the first product that keeps my hair soft but not weighed down. It is expensive but so worth it... no point in spending a ton of money to keep my hair blonde and pretty if i am not going to use good products to keep it looking nice! I would recommend this to anyone with really fine hair! (And my BFF uses the Hydrate Me from Kevin Murphy and she loves it too!)</li>
            <li> I have very short fine hair that is colored.  This shampoo gave my hair body and kept the color from fading.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievabley luxurious product for fine thin hair that needs a boost! Nothing else like it!!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I just wish the pricec was more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years. I normally get it from my hairdresser.  It is normally pink and very thick in consistency.  I noticed this shipment it is totally watered down to being runny.  Someone is opening the package, diluting it and adding back the heat sealer (which is easy to do with an iron).  If you want the real product, full strength, don&#x27;t order it from this company.  Nice try.</li>
            <li> This does not create a lather unless you use a VERY LARGE amount which is very upsetting considering the price of the product. I ended up washing my hair with a different shampoo and conditioner again after using this as the angel wash and rinse just does not make my hair feel clean.  I felt like i applied product to the top of my head and washed it out with water didnt make my hair feel as if i cleaned it. Ugh will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> I saw some negative reviews about this product not lathering well, so I wanted to write a positive review for it because I really do love this product.  I have shoulder length hair and use about a quarter sized dollop to soap up - it&#x27;s enough to get my hair feeling clean after I dry it even though it may not lather up a lot like in those Herbal Essences commercials.  It&#x27;s low in sulates (which is an ingredient that gets products to lather up), so that may explain why some people have issues with the decrease in suds, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that this shampoo isn&#x27;t doing its job of cleaning your hair!  I use it because it preserves color a lot better and for longer than regular shampoos that just strip away color after just a use.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which I love because I have fine hair.  Oh and it smells like Froot Loops to me, which I rather enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I buy this from my salon; it&#x27;s cheaper than what Amazon has quoted!  (see other review on the conditioner)  It cost me $27.</li>
