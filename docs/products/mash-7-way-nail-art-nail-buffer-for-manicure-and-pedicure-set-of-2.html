            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality product that has worked well since purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>and they have never looked so good after removal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>It also puts a shine so amazing on the tops of my nails, you&#x27;d swear I have polish on.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what I was hoping, which is make my nails incredibly shiny without nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Ok the large buffer is great!</li>
            <li>but i have more effective options.</li>
            <li>Finally we watched an instructional video someone had done on the popular internet video portal - and there we found how to best use the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold because of the size/thickness.  </li>
            <li>Just to let you all know. :)</li>
            <li>No complaints and if I need more (this was bought as a gift, but I got to try it out)</li>
            <li>but the results are better when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok, anyway.</li>
            <li>Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll move on.</li>
            <li>ok, anyway.</li>
            <li>Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll move on.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one like it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>My mom is going to love this as part of her Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Mash just not this item</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>I love that the steps are written on each side, and color coded as well.</li>
            <li>which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so i consider the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>These files are OK.</li>
            <li>Overall a great tool and a good price.</li>
            <li>It makes my unadorned nails look much more healthy and cared for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I went for this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my unadorned nails look much more healthy and cared for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I went for this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks so much better than it did before.</li>
            <li>I had never used this type of file/buffer so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>It works OK.</li>
            <li>This product was just ok.</li>
            <li>Better to sell separately.</li>
            <li>Great deal thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on to something better...</li>
            <li>Once we understood how to work this better</li>
            <li>we were satisfied, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>Just follow the labels and you will have beautifully shined natural nails in no time!  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty good and conditions your nails.</li>
            <li>It is a quick and easy way to make sure your nails always look nice without having to wear polish (which I never do).  </li>
            <li>The large one did a really good job, it takes time to finish buffing all my nails</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like this product for pedicure and manicure, everything is right there and handy.  </li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, out of about 15 other brands.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I liked it so much I tried to order a couple to give to family members but couldn&#x27;t find it on the site any more.  </li>
            <li>Each side is numbered so they are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Compact, colorful, and overall great!  </li>
            <li>Originally awesome and left my nails clean and well trimmed, however after a bit the color started rubbing off and onto my fingers, rarely use now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, it feels like a quality product that&#x27;s worth more than the 4 bucks I paid for it, and it even comes with an additional travel-size version.</li>
            <li>Same nail buffers that are used at Nail Salons, great quality.  </li>
            <li>I use it on myself and my husband (as I am trying to keep his nails smooth</li>
            <li>And the smooth glossy shine on the tops of my nails keeps sticky dough from caking up (pun intended).  </li>
            <li>So I would have given this 3 starts, but it was cheap, so I&#x27;m bumping up a star for that.</li>
            <li>the big nail buffer works great</li>
            <li>but this one is cheap nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Just like it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that they get the job done and are of similar grade to rite aid&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li>(You lightly file the surface, not the edges, of your nails.)  </li>
            <li>Is there a difference between \\&quot;smooth</li>
            <li>edges\\&quot; and \\&quot;smooth nail\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>It relaxes me and I enjoy the time.</li>
            <li>This should be a golden item to all those who love to do their nails</li>
            <li>I have never seen my nails so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Both files are easy to grip and the thickness makes for a quick manicure.</li>
            <li>It is easy on my natural nail, it does make my nails end up smooth &amp; nicely filed, just wish, that it came with instructions on what sides to use, once the words start fading, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>Purchased this set for home use and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I love that each color-coded area is also numbered (for the steps) and labeled (the function) on the buffer itself, not on the plastic sleeve as it appeared to me at first.  </li>
            <li>My nail is super smooth</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing tools that will give a professional results.</li>
            <li>I love that the buffing edges go around the curves of the block, it really helps get all the way to the edges.</li>
            <li>have not used the mini one, but it looks cool.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a week and it made my nails really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>THey both work really well and make your nails look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I look like I have a gorgeous french manicure.  </li>
            <li>Even so, not bad for how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look for any deeper artistic truth than that.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look for any deeper artistic truth than that.</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending it out so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Peels quickly.</li>
            <li>They get worn out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>, I will stick to the opi 2 way high shine buffing block:)</li>
            <li>It left them nice and smooth, and very shiny!</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy and creates a shiny smooth nail when used according to the steps labeled on the nail buffer.</li>
            <li>You can &#x27;service&#x27; your nails in your own home to the standard of a nail salon.</li>
            <li>and they are useful.</li>
            <li>I love all the various surfaces to fit any smoothing needs.</li>
            <li>I am giving it to the thrift shop where someone will pay 25 cents for it and maybe it&#x27;s worth that.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take off one star because the mini buffer, when is that ever useful?  </li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel size fits nicely into my small handbag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to wash and clean my hands now since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If it was just misspelled on one of them I might think it was just s funny error, but it was misspelled several times on each of them, kind of off-putting.</li>
            <li>My nails look great and with very little effort.</li>
            <li>The large one fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li>Listen, there are 7 progressive steps from very coarse to very fine, and that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>Listen, there are 7 progressive steps from very coarse to very fine, and that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>After trying this, I realize a coarse and fine side as on most emery boards is really all I need, and  much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>There are more than enough surfaces to get exactly the right results.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>*).</li>
            <li>This is really an aggravating product:/I ended up giving it away!</li>
            <li>It will not fix nail bending like a hot spoon does.</li>
            <li>Being a nail biting dude just like the first dude, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I was using the buffer incorrectly at first.  </li>
            <li>My package came with two \\&quot;files.\\&quot;  The larger one is better in that it has every type of surface you could want.  </li>
            <li>I had an initial Nail Buffer that I had bought from Walmart, which was surprisingly much better quality than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first time using one of these</li>
            <li>probably a glass nail file that will actually last through more than two uses.</li>
            <li>#3 PINK - Fine grit to smooth the edges of your nail</li>
            <li>I am really excited to have a little travel sized one too. :)</li>
            <li>So I have no use apparently for the little one but the big one is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>So I was impressed by the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full-size gizmo has 7 different files/buffers which are labeled as \\&quot;steps\\&quot; and get progressively less coarse.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little nail file.  </li>
            <li>I am a classical guitarists and have been searching for a nail file capable of delivering the smooth edges i needed.</li>
            <li>Works very well and comes as advertised.  </li>
            <li>#2 LIGHT BLUE - Medium Grit to refine the shape of your nail&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>#5 YELLOW - Smooth Nail&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>Is there really a difference between a \\&quot;condition\\&quot;, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and \\&quot;polish and shine\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>Is there really a difference between a \\&quot;condition\\&quot;, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and \\&quot;polish and shine\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because i was a couple dollars short from free shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not sure why there are two, the mini is exactly the same as the big, but they work great!  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t any better or worse than many of the others I&#x27;ve used, they do what they should and that&#x27;s really what matters.</li>
            <li>but these were much cheaper</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the filing ones much.</li>
            <li>I broke a nail straight across the tip</li>
            <li>At the end of all six steps, you&#x27;ll have smooth, shiny, buffed nails that can then be coated with polish or just left as</li>
            <li>I really like the ease with which these Nail Buffers are handled.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Sort of an unusual item -</li>
            <li>The small file hasn&#x27;t been useful for either myself or the hubby, but the large one has been ok, for the price.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if they would make the foam a couple millimeters larger than the file, as they did in for the small one.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got long nails, I have no doubt that this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having a small one included, like to use at work or keep in a bag.</li>
            <li>will be buying a new one from Amazon or Walmart but certainly won&#x27;t buy this particular one.</li>
            <li>These are fine for natural nail only in my opinion.</li>
            <li>We have been using it for a while now and find that we don&#x27;t use the #1 or #2 side much because it is too rough for nails that are already fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to make them look decent.</li>
            <li>The smaller buffer does not really have the same texture as the large one however it does work fairly well.  </li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this file/buffer.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a legend, for your convenience:  Side #1 BLUE - Coarse grit to shape nail  Side #2 LIGHT BLUE - Medium Grit to refine the shape of your nail  Side #3 PINK - Fine grit to smooth the edges of your nail  Side</li>
            <li>One of the sides dulled very quickly, the edges feel sharp, and it does not file close to the cuticle</li>
            <li>The purse size is handy and hard to find</li>
            <li>It really reduces the frequency i need to go have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li>The only real issue I have encountered is that the edge of the coarse grit (Step 1) borders the smooth buff surface of Step 6, and I&#x27;ve cut into my nail surface with that edge.  </li>
            <li>I use them daily and having lots of choices makes them fun.</li>
            <li>-normally i would have to cut off the rest of the nail.</li>
            <li>I wish it would have included better instructions rather than having to do a few trial and errors and ruining some of the product.  </li>
            <li>It came with the large one with evrything you need to file your nails profesionally and a smaller one to put in your purse when you need a fast fix and never have a file.</li>
            <li>The names of the steps are also different, so it&#x27;s important to gain experience on the larger one to know that \\&quot;even</li>
            <li>The little extra small buffer is nice to keep in your purse for when you want to touch up or just want to do your nails on the go. :)</li>
            <li>i am way too busy to try to flip to all the sides needed just to get a high shine on a nail.</li>
            <li>However, some of the juxtoposition of some very rough and very smooth sides requires some significant attention to avoid slipping accidentally filing the flat side of your nail when buffing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing pretty well at avoiding it these days, but I still deal with nails and cuticles that are now trained to be brittle and misshapen, both a source of some embarrassment and both constantly tempt me into a backslide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and will do the job for a little while, but look elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality buffer.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I filed down too much because I am used to the cheaper buffers that really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>These nail files are strong and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re getting this for my reasons, I do recommend buying a set of cheap nail files like the Revlons, since between the hardcore manicures you&#x27;ll want to file down the tempting nicks and hangnails often</li>
            <li>find the small buffer more manageable than the large one, although the two aren&#x27;t entirely interchangeable.  </li>
            <li>The large file provides seven edges from shape to shine and the smaller file provides six surfaces - from refine to shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large buffer could definitely be improved.</li>
            <li>the end, my nails are shinier than I&#x27;ve ever seen them, almost as though there&#x27;s clear nail polish on them.</li>
            <li>those explanations next to the steps and colors really are extraneous though.</li>
            <li>After frequent use the item seems to hold up quite well.</li>
            <li>There is a side where you could easily soft file nail edges, too.</li>
            <li>This causes scuff marks, necessitating starting the whole thing over again.</li>
            <li>Despite these differences, I find it much easier to buff and shine my nails with a smaller tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying a few more to stock up on since I will not use it if someone else does.  </li>
            <li>These nail buffers are cute and useful, but unfortunately the sides I use most frequently (shape and shine, about once a week) are well worn after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>The price was just right for this item, and it works just as expected.</li>
            <li>while I have not used the little nail buffer yet, the larger piece is very useful and lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li>The shipping speed was decent, arrived in about a week and a half and was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>large file arrived with a dent in the middle of the Step 3 surface, but since it&#x27;s so large and my nails so small, I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>The small buffer, which I kept for myself, does a fantastic job of getting out the ridges as well.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to hold, hard to lose nail file</li>
            <li>#5 YELLOW - Smooth Nail  Side #6 WHITE - Nail Buffer  Side #7 GREEN - Polish and Shine  All those explanations next to the steps and colors really are extraneous though.</li>
            <li>For instance, the small one&#x27;s \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; surface is closer to the large one&#x27;s step 4 surface; it isn&#x27;t the brute force file of the large one, although it works well for touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>The 7 steps are a little time consuming but it is well worth the results.</li>
            <li>She has spent more time than usual prettying up her nails ever since I got this for her.</li>
            <li>Years ago, I owned a P-shine kit that gave me polished/buffed nails that looked shiny even without a clear coat of nail polish, and I wanted to get a similar result without using the paste.  </li>

            <li>But other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Although these are nice, the file part of them is set back from the edge making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li>It took two weeks to get here... really hard to use, to much flipping around, the(with)is way too narrow to be comfortable...</li>
            <li>the con is that the larger surfaces are too rough to use regularly without thinning the nail and the finer sides wear out too fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this item with a gift card as well and thought I was going to be receiving something quite different; turns out this &#x27;file&#x27; barely does anything to my nails and is now sitting gathering dust under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make my nails look better because after working they get very dull and rough</li>
            <li>Only limitation is that it&#x27;s slightly too thick to use on corners of nails, but totally possible - just need a bit more time.</li>

            <li> The file/buff works great.  </li>
            <li> This product works great... almost too great.</li>

            <li> These are very nice.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good quality product that has worked well since purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> and they have never looked so good after removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> It also puts a shine so amazing on the tops of my nails, you&#x27;d swear I have polish on.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what I was hoping, which is make my nails incredibly shiny without nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Ok the large buffer is great!</li>
            <li> but i have more effective options.</li>
            <li> Finally we watched an instructional video someone had done on the popular internet video portal - and there we found how to best use the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold because of the size/thickness.  </li>
            <li> Just to let you all know. :)</li>
            <li> No complaints and if I need more (this was bought as a gift, but I got to try it out)</li>
            <li> but the results are better when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok, anyway.</li>
            <li> Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll move on.</li>
            <li> ok, anyway.</li>
            <li> Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll move on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one like it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My mom is going to love this as part of her Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Mash just not this item</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> I love that the steps are written on each side, and color coded as well.</li>
            <li> which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> so i consider the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> These files are OK.</li>
            <li> Overall a great tool and a good price.</li>
            <li> It makes my unadorned nails look much more healthy and cared for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I went for this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my unadorned nails look much more healthy and cared for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I went for this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks so much better than it did before.</li>
            <li> I had never used this type of file/buffer so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> It works OK.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok.</li>
            <li> Better to sell separately.</li>
            <li> Great deal thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on to something better...</li>
            <li> Once we understood how to work this better</li>
            <li> we were satisfied, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just follow the labels and you will have beautifully shined natural nails in no time!  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty good and conditions your nails.</li>
            <li> It is a quick and easy way to make sure your nails always look nice without having to wear polish (which I never do).  </li>
            <li> The large one did a really good job, it takes time to finish buffing all my nails</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this product for pedicure and manicure, everything is right there and handy.  </li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, out of about 15 other brands.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I liked it so much I tried to order a couple to give to family members but couldn&#x27;t find it on the site any more.  </li>
            <li> Each side is numbered so they are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Compact, colorful, and overall great!  </li>
            <li> Originally awesome and left my nails clean and well trimmed, however after a bit the color started rubbing off and onto my fingers, rarely use now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, it feels like a quality product that&#x27;s worth more than the 4 bucks I paid for it, and it even comes with an additional travel-size version.</li>
            <li> Same nail buffers that are used at Nail Salons, great quality.  </li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my husband (as I am trying to keep his nails smooth</li>
            <li> And the smooth glossy shine on the tops of my nails keeps sticky dough from caking up (pun intended).  </li>
            <li> So I would have given this 3 starts, but it was cheap, so I&#x27;m bumping up a star for that.</li>
            <li> the big nail buffer works great</li>
            <li> but this one is cheap nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Just like it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that they get the job done and are of similar grade to rite aid&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li> (You lightly file the surface, not the edges, of your nails.)  </li>
            <li> Is there a difference between \\&quot;smooth</li>
            <li> edges\\&quot; and \\&quot;smooth nail\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li> It relaxes me and I enjoy the time.</li>
            <li> This should be a golden item to all those who love to do their nails</li>
            <li> I have never seen my nails so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Both files are easy to grip and the thickness makes for a quick manicure.</li>
            <li> It is easy on my natural nail, it does make my nails end up smooth &amp; nicely filed, just wish, that it came with instructions on what sides to use, once the words start fading, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for home use and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I love that each color-coded area is also numbered (for the steps) and labeled (the function) on the buffer itself, not on the plastic sleeve as it appeared to me at first.  </li>
            <li> My nail is super smooth</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing tools that will give a professional results.</li>
            <li> I love that the buffing edges go around the curves of the block, it really helps get all the way to the edges.</li>
            <li> have not used the mini one, but it looks cool.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week and it made my nails really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> THey both work really well and make your nails look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I look like I have a gorgeous french manicure.  </li>
            <li> Even so, not bad for how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look for any deeper artistic truth than that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look for any deeper artistic truth than that.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending it out so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Peels quickly.</li>
            <li> They get worn out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> , I will stick to the opi 2 way high shine buffing block:)</li>
            <li> It left them nice and smooth, and very shiny!</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy and creates a shiny smooth nail when used according to the steps labeled on the nail buffer.</li>
            <li> You can &#x27;service&#x27; your nails in your own home to the standard of a nail salon.</li>
            <li> and they are useful.</li>
            <li> I love all the various surfaces to fit any smoothing needs.</li>
            <li> I am giving it to the thrift shop where someone will pay 25 cents for it and maybe it&#x27;s worth that.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take off one star because the mini buffer, when is that ever useful?  </li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel size fits nicely into my small handbag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to wash and clean my hands now since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it was just misspelled on one of them I might think it was just s funny error, but it was misspelled several times on each of them, kind of off-putting.</li>
            <li> My nails look great and with very little effort.</li>
            <li> The large one fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li> Listen, there are 7 progressive steps from very coarse to very fine, and that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> Listen, there are 7 progressive steps from very coarse to very fine, and that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> After trying this, I realize a coarse and fine side as on most emery boards is really all I need, and  much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> There are more than enough surfaces to get exactly the right results.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> *).</li>
            <li> This is really an aggravating product:/I ended up giving it away!</li>
            <li> It will not fix nail bending like a hot spoon does.</li>
            <li> Being a nail biting dude just like the first dude, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I was using the buffer incorrectly at first.  </li>
            <li> My package came with two \\&quot;files.\\&quot;  The larger one is better in that it has every type of surface you could want.  </li>
            <li> I had an initial Nail Buffer that I had bought from Walmart, which was surprisingly much better quality than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first time using one of these</li>
            <li> probably a glass nail file that will actually last through more than two uses.</li>
            <li> #3 PINK - Fine grit to smooth the edges of your nail</li>
            <li> I am really excited to have a little travel sized one too. :)</li>
            <li> So I have no use apparently for the little one but the big one is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> So I was impressed by the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full-size gizmo has 7 different files/buffers which are labeled as \\&quot;steps\\&quot; and get progressively less coarse.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little nail file.  </li>
            <li> I am a classical guitarists and have been searching for a nail file capable of delivering the smooth edges i needed.</li>
            <li> Works very well and comes as advertised.  </li>
            <li> #2 LIGHT BLUE - Medium Grit to refine the shape of your nail&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> #5 YELLOW - Smooth Nail&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> Is there really a difference between a \\&quot;condition\\&quot;, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and \\&quot;polish and shine\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> Is there really a difference between a \\&quot;condition\\&quot;, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and \\&quot;polish and shine\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because i was a couple dollars short from free shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why there are two, the mini is exactly the same as the big, but they work great!  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t any better or worse than many of the others I&#x27;ve used, they do what they should and that&#x27;s really what matters.</li>
            <li> but these were much cheaper</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the filing ones much.</li>
            <li> I broke a nail straight across the tip</li>
            <li> At the end of all six steps, you&#x27;ll have smooth, shiny, buffed nails that can then be coated with polish or just left as</li>
            <li> I really like the ease with which these Nail Buffers are handled.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Sort of an unusual item -</li>
            <li> The small file hasn&#x27;t been useful for either myself or the hubby, but the large one has been ok, for the price.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if they would make the foam a couple millimeters larger than the file, as they did in for the small one.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got long nails, I have no doubt that this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having a small one included, like to use at work or keep in a bag.</li>
            <li> will be buying a new one from Amazon or Walmart but certainly won&#x27;t buy this particular one.</li>
            <li> These are fine for natural nail only in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for a while now and find that we don&#x27;t use the #1 or #2 side much because it is too rough for nails that are already fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to make them look decent.</li>
            <li> The smaller buffer does not really have the same texture as the large one however it does work fairly well.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this file/buffer.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a legend, for your convenience:  Side #1 BLUE - Coarse grit to shape nail  Side #2 LIGHT BLUE - Medium Grit to refine the shape of your nail  Side #3 PINK - Fine grit to smooth the edges of your nail  Side</li>
            <li> One of the sides dulled very quickly, the edges feel sharp, and it does not file close to the cuticle</li>
            <li> The purse size is handy and hard to find</li>
            <li> It really reduces the frequency i need to go have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li> The only real issue I have encountered is that the edge of the coarse grit (Step 1) borders the smooth buff surface of Step 6, and I&#x27;ve cut into my nail surface with that edge.  </li>
            <li> I use them daily and having lots of choices makes them fun.</li>
            <li> -normally i would have to cut off the rest of the nail.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have included better instructions rather than having to do a few trial and errors and ruining some of the product.  </li>
            <li> It came with the large one with evrything you need to file your nails profesionally and a smaller one to put in your purse when you need a fast fix and never have a file.</li>
            <li> The names of the steps are also different, so it&#x27;s important to gain experience on the larger one to know that \\&quot;even</li>
            <li> The little extra small buffer is nice to keep in your purse for when you want to touch up or just want to do your nails on the go. :)</li>
            <li> i am way too busy to try to flip to all the sides needed just to get a high shine on a nail.</li>
            <li> However, some of the juxtoposition of some very rough and very smooth sides requires some significant attention to avoid slipping accidentally filing the flat side of your nail when buffing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing pretty well at avoiding it these days, but I still deal with nails and cuticles that are now trained to be brittle and misshapen, both a source of some embarrassment and both constantly tempt me into a backslide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and will do the job for a little while, but look elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality buffer.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I filed down too much because I am used to the cheaper buffers that really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These nail files are strong and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting this for my reasons, I do recommend buying a set of cheap nail files like the Revlons, since between the hardcore manicures you&#x27;ll want to file down the tempting nicks and hangnails often</li>
            <li> find the small buffer more manageable than the large one, although the two aren&#x27;t entirely interchangeable.  </li>
            <li> The large file provides seven edges from shape to shine and the smaller file provides six surfaces - from refine to shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large buffer could definitely be improved.</li>
            <li> the end, my nails are shinier than I&#x27;ve ever seen them, almost as though there&#x27;s clear nail polish on them.</li>
            <li> those explanations next to the steps and colors really are extraneous though.</li>
            <li> After frequent use the item seems to hold up quite well.</li>
            <li> There is a side where you could easily soft file nail edges, too.</li>
            <li> This causes scuff marks, necessitating starting the whole thing over again.</li>
            <li> Despite these differences, I find it much easier to buff and shine my nails with a smaller tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying a few more to stock up on since I will not use it if someone else does.  </li>
            <li> These nail buffers are cute and useful, but unfortunately the sides I use most frequently (shape and shine, about once a week) are well worn after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The price was just right for this item, and it works just as expected.</li>
            <li> while I have not used the little nail buffer yet, the larger piece is very useful and lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li> The shipping speed was decent, arrived in about a week and a half and was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> large file arrived with a dent in the middle of the Step 3 surface, but since it&#x27;s so large and my nails so small, I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> The small buffer, which I kept for myself, does a fantastic job of getting out the ridges as well.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to hold, hard to lose nail file</li>
            <li> #5 YELLOW - Smooth Nail  Side #6 WHITE - Nail Buffer  Side #7 GREEN - Polish and Shine  All those explanations next to the steps and colors really are extraneous though.</li>
            <li> For instance, the small one&#x27;s \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; surface is closer to the large one&#x27;s step 4 surface; it isn&#x27;t the brute force file of the large one, although it works well for touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> The 7 steps are a little time consuming but it is well worth the results.</li>
            <li> She has spent more time than usual prettying up her nails ever since I got this for her.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I owned a P-shine kit that gave me polished/buffed nails that looked shiny even without a clear coat of nail polish, and I wanted to get a similar result without using the paste.  </li>

            <li> No, by all linguistic standards, these are flowery synonyms with the same damn meaning.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Although these are nice, the file part of them is set back from the edge making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It took two weeks to get here... really hard to use, to much flipping around, the(with)is way too narrow to be comfortable...</li>
            <li> the con is that the larger surfaces are too rough to use regularly without thinning the nail and the finer sides wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this item with a gift card as well and thought I was going to be receiving something quite different; turns out this &#x27;file&#x27; barely does anything to my nails and is now sitting gathering dust under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make my nails look better because after working they get very dull and rough</li>
            <li> Only limitation is that it&#x27;s slightly too thick to use on corners of nails, but totally possible - just need a bit more time.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have is, when filing nails, because these are thick, you can&#x27;t get to the edges of nails as good as a thin nail file.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to fly off the handle, but...</li>
            <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to fly off the handle, but...</li>
            <li> After you are done your nails look like they have an extremely shiny coat of clear nail polish on them.  </li>
            <li> Dont last long and very fragile.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last long cause my last one broke in a month.</li>
            <li> My nails certainly aren&#x27;t that small</li>
            <li> They work well enough, but they don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if the shape would be workable, as I&#x27;ve always used flat files &amp; buffers.  </li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t last very long before they wore out (2-3 uses).</li>
            <li> Already there are several spots on each side that have been worn smooth and are therefore completely useless for shaping nails.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that the nail buffer might be lower quality than a drugstore buffer I usually buy for her stocking, but the 8-step buffer looks nearly identical and feels to be of the same quality.  </li>
            <li> and I can see how it&#x27;s a well-designed product for people with long nails.</li>
            <li> I now am careful to position the buffer to avoid contact with the nail during the final stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a long time I was looking for this nail buffer.</li>
            <li> Product was lower quality than expected, and will not last very long.</li>
            <li> This nail buff keeps my nails short since I use it daily just to get the little bit of growth off.  </li>
            <li> The small buffer is fine, though a little small in size.</li>
            <li> Not that I care about shiny nails per se, but the pristine look and feel leaves much less temptation (no excuse to \\&quot;just even that</li>
            <li> She had been on the search for a nail file similar to one she had previously.  </li>
            <li> I am a man and recently started clear-coating or painting my nails black.</li>
            <li> I use these for my nails as a classical guitarist and usually buy them locally</li>
            <li> So I would have been better off with a buffer that is very thin and flat rather than the thick, square cross-section of this one.</li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds per nail per step, and you only need to use steps 4-7 on the surface of the nail (the rest are for shaping the edge of the nail).  </li>
            <li> I am buying another one of these since I have almost wore the GREEN final buffer pad out.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say, it works</li>
            <li> And the small one&#x27;s &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; will barely file ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li> On mine, the filing steps are on a hard plastic surface that almost sticks out over the buffing sections when you use it, due to the soft foam underneath.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s less embarrassing to have nails that are too shiny than too funky (but only slightly so).</li>
            <li> Due to artificial hand joints I can not lift many boxes when left on sidewalk or in driveway, which has been where I find them for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that, unless you know how to buff your nails, it&#x27;s not clear what the labeled steps mean.  </li>
            <li> Working in a bakery I get dough, sugar, and other crusty stuff under and on my nails all the time.  </li>
            <li> The other lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> and another reviewer complained about labels being in some other language on the smaller buffer.</li>
            <li> Oh and another reviewer complained about labels being in some other language on the smaller buffer.</li>
            <li> The buffer is of average quality, but you do get an additional mini-buffer, which is convenient.</li>
            <li> In other words, this set is a go!  </li>
            <li> I find it much nicer than very thin emory boards.  </li>
            <li> This nail buffer is your typical nail buffer.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing out the little one.</li>
            <li> you might as well toss that little guy in the trash.</li>
            <li> It did put me off a little bit that the word &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; was misspelled on them.</li>
            <li> Do your self a favor &amp; get this &amp; throw all your other filing sets!!</li>

            <li> Exceeded wife&#x27;s expectations for her nails.  She had been on the search for a nail file similar to one she had previously.  This one did the job.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I am a man and recently started clear-coating or painting my nails black. This 7-way buffer and manicure set is great and I can see how it&#x27;s a well-designed product for people with long nails. However, I keep my nails short. So I would have been better off with a buffer that is very thin and flat rather than the thick, square cross-section of this one. If you have short nails, get a flat buffer, because one like this will be very difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got long nails, I have no doubt that this is a fantastic product. Giving this 5 stars because I just chose the wrong one, but wanted short-nailed people to know!</li>
            <li> I keep the small file in my desk for touch-ups or when I break a nail, doesn&#x27;t need to be heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger one didn&#x27;t quite seem to be up to the task of multiple uses.  One of the sides dulled very quickly, the edges feel sharp, and it does not file close to the cuticle cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to the double sided files after this one.</li>
            <li> Ok the large buffer is great! My nail is super smooth it&#x27;s amazing! BUT I don&#x27;t know what the smaller buffer says on the labels because it&#x27;s not in English and when I used google translater it didn&#x27;t find a match for the \\&quot;Nagel Fil\\&quot; and \\&quot;Nagel Polerare\\&quot;. Though it did say it was Italian but refused to translate it properly.  So I have no use apparently for the little one but the big one is perfect for my needs. Just follow the labels and you will have beautifully shined natural nails in no time!  EDIT: Ah somehow google translate misinterpreted the language as Italian. I google searched \\&quot;nagel fil\\&quot; and found it was actually Swedish, so I went back to google translator and manually chose swedish and input those terms and it came out to \\&quot;Naile file\\&quot; and \\&quot;nail polisher\\&quot;. Just to let you all know. :)</li>
            <li> The price was just right for this item, and it works just as expected. No complaints and if I need more (this was bought as a gift, but I got to try it out), I will definitely look for these.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer is your typical nail buffer. Seems very sturdy and creates a shiny smooth nail when used according to the steps labeled on the nail buffer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to hold, hard to lose nail file this is it.  Works very well and comes as advertised.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My fiancee loves both of these pieces.  She has spent more time than usual prettying up her nails ever since I got this for her.</li>
            <li> Although these are nice, the file part of them is set back from the edge making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of files. The large file provides seven edges from shape to shine and the smaller file provides six surfaces - from refine to shine. Both files are easy to grip and the thickness makes for a quick manicure.</li>
            <li> Originally awesome and left my nails clean and well trimmed, however after a bit the color started rubbing off and onto my fingers, rarely use now.</li>
            <li> Yeah I&#x27;m a dude and I bought a manicure kit. Wanna make somethin&#x27; of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a nail biter. I&#x27;m doing pretty well at avoiding it these days, but I still deal with nails and cuticles that are now trained to be brittle and misshapen, both a source of some embarrassment and both constantly tempt me into a backslide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this buffer, along with [[ASIN:B001BBZ8AY Revlon 10-pack coarse nail files]] and [[ASIN:B00013YYS0 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re getting this for my reasons, I do recommend buying a set of cheap nail files like the Revlons, since between the hardcore manicures you&#x27;ll want to file down the tempting nicks and hangnails often (I find myself having to do that many times per day), which would wear out the file on the comparatively expensive buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on to the buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it feels like a quality product that&#x27;s worth more than the 4 bucks I paid for it, and it even comes with an additional travel-size version. So I was impressed by the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full-size gizmo has 7 different files/buffers which are labeled as \\&quot;steps\\&quot; and get progressively less coarse. Yes, for a guy who isn&#x27;t used to spending time on nails, this is a tedious process. 7 steps x 10 nails x 10 seconds per step &#x3D; 11 minutes and some repeating decimal remainder that I didn&#x27;t bother to convert into seconds, but suffice it to say, it feels like an eternity. I&#x27;ve tried skipping steps but the results are better when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my nails are shinier than I&#x27;ve ever seen them, almost as though there&#x27;s clear nail polish on them. Not that I care about shiny nails per se, but the pristine look and feel leaves much less temptation (no excuse to \\&quot;just even that out a little\\&quot; *nibble nibble*). And it&#x27;s less embarrassing to have nails that are too shiny than too funky (but only slightly so). Massaging in some of that Burt&#x27;s Bees lemon butter stuff and tucking the cuticles back into my fingers (tip found online) also helps keep those cuticles from presenting their devilish allure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The printed labels on each zone of the buffer do rub off with use, which sucks, since there&#x27;s no separate printed documentation. Here&#x27;s a legend, for your convenience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side #1 BLUE - Coarse grit to shape nail&lt;br /&gt;Side #2 LIGHT BLUE - Medium Grit to refine the shape of your nail&lt;br /&gt;Side #3 PINK - Fine grit to smooth the edges of your nail&lt;br /&gt;Side #4 CYAN - Condition Nail&lt;br /&gt;Side #5 YELLOW - Smooth Nail&lt;br /&gt;Side #6 WHITE - Nail Buffer&lt;br /&gt;Side #7 GREEN - Polish and Shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those explanations next to the steps and colors really are extraneous though. Is there really a difference between a \\&quot;condition\\&quot;, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and \\&quot;polish and shine\\&quot;? No, by all linguistic standards, these are flowery synonyms with the same damn meaning. Sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to fly off the handle, but... ok, anyway. Listen, there are 7 progressive steps from very coarse to very fine, and that&#x27;s that. Don&#x27;t look for any deeper artistic truth than that. You&#x27;re filing your nails, not oil painting. Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll move on. It&#x27;s just so frustrating when... yeah I know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and another reviewer complained about labels being in some other language on the smaller buffer.

            <li> I just opened this and started using it. I love that the buffing edges go around the curves of the block, it really helps get all the way to the edges. the roughest two are too rough for my nails personally, but i have very thin nails to begin with.</li>
            <li> The smaller buffer does not really have the same texture as the large one however it does work fairly well.  Good product!</li>
            <li> I found one like this at the dollar store once, and used it until it literally fell apart. I haven&#x27;t been able to find another one like it anywhere else. I am really excited to have a little travel sized one too. :)</li>
            <li> Product was lower quality than expected, and will not last very long. Even so, not bad for how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li> Same nail buffers that are used at Nail Salons, great quality.  I would recommend this nail buffer, great for home use.</li>
            <li> Looks great!  Thank you for sending it out so quickly.  My mom is going to love this as part of her Christmas presents.  Merry Nails.</li>
            <li> It took two weeks to get here... really hard to use, to much flipping around, the(with)is way too narrow to be comfortable... i am way too busy to try to flip to all the sides needed just to get a high shine on a nail. This is really an aggravating product:/I ended up giving it away! Don&#x27;t get me wrong I LOVE Mash just not this item, I will stick to the opi 2 way high shine buffing block:)</li>
            <li> This is a very nice tool for nails and toes.  I use it on myself and my husband (as I am trying to keep his nails smooth so he stops biting them).  It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold because of the size/thickness.  I find it much nicer than very thin emory boards.  We have been using it for a while now and find that we don&#x27;t use the #1 or #2 side much because it is too rough for nails that are already fairly smooth.  After frequent use the item seems to hold up quite well.</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a Christmas stocking stuffer for a family member.  I was concerned that the nail buffer might be lower quality than a drugstore buffer I usually buy for her stocking, but the 8-step buffer looks nearly identical and feels to be of the same quality.  The small buffer, which I kept for myself, does a fantastic job of getting out the ridges as well.  In other words, this set is a go!  It is an excellent value and it does the job it&#x27;s meant to do.  Why pay more?</li>
            <li> This really is a great product. It really reduces the frequency i need to go have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li> These are very nice.  When you take the wrappers off, I was afraid that the labels were on the celophane.  But the labels are on the actual tools themselves.</li>
            <li> Both buffers work excellent for the price. It&#x27;s nice having a small one included, like to use at work or keep in a bag.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I was hoping, which is make my nails incredibly shiny without nail polish.  It takes a few seconds per nail per step, and you only need to use steps 4-7 on the surface of the nail (the rest are for shaping the edge of the nail).  Unlike another review here, I found that my buffers were both correctly labelled in English, so hopefully that was just one misplaced package with the wrong language!</li>
            <li> I am a classical guitarists and have been searching for a nail file capable of delivering the smooth edges i needed. This item outperformed. I was highly impressed with the item. I would recommend for classical guitarists. It will not fix nail bending like a hot spoon does.</li>
            <li> Do your self a favor &amp; get this &amp; throw all your other filing sets!! Absolutely amazing tools that will give a professional results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Being a nail biting dude just like the first dude, I decided to give this a try.  I no longer have that problem of too short nails getting even shorter.  This nail buff keeps my nails short since I use it daily just to get the little bit of growth off.  It also puts a shine so amazing on the tops of my nails, you&#x27;d swear I have polish on.  Working in a bakery I get dough, sugar, and other crusty stuff under and on my nails all the time.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d bite them.  If you have to nail, you can&#x27;t get crap under them.  This buffer has saved them (and me) from the embarrassing bit nail look. And the smooth glossy shine on the tops of my nails keeps sticky dough from caking up (pun intended).  It&#x27;s so much easier to wash and clean my hands now since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the mini one, but it looks cool.  I am buying another one of these since I have almost wore the GREEN final buffer pad out.  The sides are fraying.  Being a guy whose never done his nails a day in my almost 30 years I was using the buffer incorrectly at first.  Maybe my second one will last me a while longer.  I will definitely be buying a few more to stock up on since I will not use it if someone else does.  Just in case.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping. No problems at all. I would encourage anyone looking for this type of item to purchase from this buyer.</li>
            <li> So I would have given this 3 starts, but it was cheap, so I&#x27;m bumping up a star for that. The buffer is of average quality, but you do get an additional mini-buffer, which is convenient. Mine didn&#x27;t last very long before they wore out (2-3 uses).</li>
            <li> These do the job but feel awkward in my hands.  I am petite, so perhaps these are just clunky for small hands.  I have used them just once, and bought them for travel. So I can&#x27;t speak to durability.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if the shape would be workable, as I&#x27;ve always used flat files &amp; buffers.  No problem!  My nails look great and with very little effort.</li>
            <li> the big nail buffer works great and I still use it about a year later. I ended up throwing out the little one. It didn&#x27;t work well and the different sides didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything.</li>
            <li> These nail buffers are cute and useful, but unfortunately the sides I use most frequently (shape and shine, about once a week) are well worn after only a few uses. They&#x27;re cheap and will do the job for a little while, but look elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality buffer.</li>
            <li> I like that each section is numbered so you know what you&#x27;re supposed to do next. Only problem I have is, when filing nails, because these are thick, you can&#x27;t get to the edges of nails as good as a thin nail file. But other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Dont last long and very fragile. Peels quickly. I like the options of all sides on it but this one is cheap nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little nail file.  It does take a couple of minutes to use all the different sides of the file (it is numbered so you know the order to use them).  After you are done your nails look like they have an extremely shiny coat of clear nail polish on them.  This is a great way to feel like you are wearing nail polish without wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great product. You can &#x27;service&#x27; your nails in your own home to the standard of a nail salon. Great price. Delivered in a timely manner. Each section of the file tells you what is does eg buffing, polishing etc along with a number - so you know which to use in which order. VERY good product.   Only limitation is that it&#x27;s slightly too thick to use on corners of nails, but totally possible - just need a bit more time.</li>
            <li> These are fine for natural nail only in my opinion. These don&#x27;t seem to last as along as I would like with gel nails. They get worn out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> while I have not used the little nail buffer yet, the larger piece is very useful and lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li> These nail files are strong and last a very long time. I use them daily and having lots of choices makes them fun.</li>
            <li> I love that the steps are written on each side, and color coded as well. Both sizes worked great for me. Will definitely be ordering this again. Even my son enjoys using this too. LOL!</li>
            <li> The large one fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I do like and use this buffer set but i have more effective options. Pro of this buffer is that you can get closer to the cuticle than with blocks the con is that the larger surfaces are too rough to use regularly without thinning the nail and the finer sides wear out too fast. If you dont have deep ridges or your dedicated to touch ups i suggest - http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Shine-Shiner-Nail-Buffer/dp/B002QY86BI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1353995711&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;flash+shiner - which is my favorite. The purse size is handy and hard to find so i consider the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Quality of these just wasn&#x27;t there, and did a poor job, especially the small one..you might as well toss that little guy in the trash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  As a matter of fact I liked it so much I tried to order a couple to give to family members but couldn&#x27;t find it on the site any more.  Hope they get them back in.  It is a quick and easy way to make sure your nails always look nice without having to wear polish (which I never do).  My package came with two \\&quot;files.\\&quot;  The larger one is better in that it has every type of surface you could want.  The smaller one unfortunately does not have the roughest surface that you need if you chip a nail and have a bit of serious filing to do.  But I highly recommend this file/buffer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because i was a couple dollars short from free shipping and she asked me to buy it for her. The shipping speed was decent, arrived in about a week and a half and was exactly what was described. It comes in a set of two and it&#x27;s quality material and can be used over and over again. My girlfriend hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why there are two, the mini is exactly the same as the big, but they work great!  I had a square buffer for years and it was falling apart, so I got this.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> These files are OK. They aren&#x27;t any better or worse than many of the others I&#x27;ve used, they do what they should and that&#x27;s really what matters. It did put me off a little bit that the word &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; was misspelled on them. It makes me think that these might be made in a place that I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to support. If it was just misspelled on one of them I might think it was just s funny error, but it was misspelled several times on each of them, kind of off-putting.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good and conditions your nails. I use this once a week and it made my nails really nice and soft. Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Just like it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s cheap in quality. The multi colored boards seem like they are going to come off. I had an initial Nail Buffer that I had bought from Walmart, which was surprisingly much better quality than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a new one from Amazon or Walmart but certainly won&#x27;t buy this particular one. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got these for my girlfriend for christmas and she likes them and they are useful. can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> I use these for my nails as a classical guitarist and usually buy them locally but these were much cheaper and I&#x27;m happy to say that they get the job done and are of similar grade to rite aid&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for home use and was not disappointed.  Good quality product that has worked well since purchase.  Perfect for those in between manicure periods or for doing manicures at home yourself.</li>
            <li> Great value for price. THey both work really well and make your nails look healthy and shiny. There is a side where you could easily soft file nail edges, too. Each side is numbered so they are easy to follow. However, some of the juxtoposition of some very rough and very smooth sides requires some significant attention to avoid slipping accidentally filing the flat side of your nail when buffing. Overall a great tool and a good price.</li>
            <li> The small buffer is fine, though a little small in size. The instructions were in English on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large buffer could definitely be improved. It has 7 areas- 3 for filing and 4 for buffing. I don&#x27;t use the filing ones much. On mine, the filing steps are on a hard plastic surface that almost sticks out over the buffing sections when you use it, due to the soft foam underneath. This causes scuff marks, necessitating starting the whole thing over again. It would be great if they would make the foam a couple millimeters larger than the file, as they did in for the small one.</li>
            <li> Because I never use nail polish, I&#x27;ve been using this type of nail groomer for about 10 years. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, out of about 15 other brands. Can&#x27;t believe I buffed and shined over a week ago and the shine is still brilliant. There are more than enough surfaces to get exactly the right results. FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li> These (set of two) are really great quality. I broke a nail straight across the tip-normally i would have to cut off the rest of the nail. But these smoothed it up immediately. I have only had them a short while, but even if they do not last forever they are such a gem, and so inexpensive i will keep ordering them. I love all the various surfaces to fit any smoothing needs.</li>
            <li> Its very good with buffing I prefer the smaller buffer for shining and polishing my nails but otherwise its very good to use you should buy it mine came in 5 days</li>
            <li> Years ago, I owned a P-shine kit that gave me polished/buffed nails that looked shiny even without a clear coat of nail polish, and I wanted to get a similar result without using the paste.  I settled on this nail buffer combination.  I love that each color-coded area is also numbered (for the steps) and labeled (the function) on the buffer itself, not on the plastic sleeve as it appeared to me at first.  The only issue is that, unless you know how to buff your nails, it&#x27;s not clear what the labeled steps mean.  For instance, what does \\&quot;condition nail\\&quot; mean?  (You lightly file the surface, not the edges, of your nails.)  Is there a difference between \\&quot;smooth edges\\&quot; and \\&quot;smooth nail\\&quot;?  (Yes -- the second one smooths the surface.)  Once you know what you&#x27;re doing, however, the labels remind you of each step.  At the end of all six steps, you&#x27;ll have smooth, shiny, buffed nails that can then be coated with polish or just left as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My large file arrived with a dent in the middle of the Step 3 surface, but since it&#x27;s so large and my nails so small, I really don&#x27;t care.  I never get close to the middle of that section.  The only real issue I have encountered is that the edge of the coarse grit (Step 1) borders the smooth buff surface of Step 6, and I&#x27;ve cut into my nail surface with that edge.  I now am careful to position the buffer to avoid contact with the nail during the final stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the small buffer more manageable than the large one, although the two aren&#x27;t entirely interchangeable.  For instance, the small one&#x27;s \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; surface is closer to the large one&#x27;s step 4 surface; it isn&#x27;t the brute force file of the large one, although it works well for touch-ups.  The buffer and shine surfaces work as well on one as they do on the otherl.  The names of the steps are also different, so it&#x27;s important to gain experience on the larger one to know that \\&quot;even out\\&quot; for Step 3 still applies to the nail edges.  Despite these differences, I find it much easier to buff and shine my nails with a smaller tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This buffer is not just a glorified emory board.  It makes my unadorned nails look much more healthy and cared for.  I&#x27;m really glad I went for this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannmuch easier to buff and shine my nails with a smaller tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This buffer is not just a glorified emory board.

            <li> I wanted to make my nails look better because after working they get very dull and rough so I wanted to make them look decent.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease with which these Nail Buffers are handled.  They work well enough, but they don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this item with a gift card as well and thought I was going to be receiving something quite different; turns out this &#x27;file&#x27; barely does anything to my nails and is now sitting gathering dust under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails all the time. It relaxes me and I enjoy the time. Well I never give me nails a break and so my nails had turned yellow from a green polish I didn&#x27;t put a base coat on. Using this nail buffer took away about 60% of the stain. It looks so much better than it did before. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to shape your nails, you should use a glass file. This should be a golden item to all those who love to do their nails like I do and trying to recover from a bad polish mistake!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once I wear this buffer away I will order another one!</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to use - because of the boxy shape it&#x27;s hard to file the outer edges of the nails. After trying this, I realize a coarse and fine side as on most emery boards is really all I need, and  much easier to use.  The buffer and polish and shine surfaces did nothing for my nails.  I am giving it to the thrift shop where someone will pay 25 cents for it and maybe it&#x27;s worth that.</li>
            <li> It is easy on my natural nail, it does make my nails end up smooth &amp; nicely filed, just wish, that it came with instructions on what sides to use, once the words start fading, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I had never used this type of file/buffer so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I can now say that if you follow the well-laid out steps, you will achieve awesome results.  I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> The small file hasn&#x27;t been useful for either myself or the hubby, but the large one has been ok, for the price.  However, the file starts falling apart after only a month of use. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  The price is right.  Easy to use.  Compact, colorful, and overall great!  Would get it again!</li>
            <li> I have RA and need the boxes (packages) delivered to my front door. Due to artificial hand joints I can not lift many boxes when left on sidewalk or in driveway, which has been where I find them for the past few months.  PLEASE print on delivery label: place package next to front door on 2nd floor landing.</li>
            <li> For a long time I was looking for this nail buffer. It works OK. I would recommend it for my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great buffer! My first time using one of these and I loved it. The large one did a really good job, it takes time to finish buffing all my nails but it was worth it in the end. It left them nice and smooth, and very shiny! The little extra small buffer is nice to keep in your purse for when you want to touch up or just want to do your nails on the go. :)</li>
            <li> But it works. I hope it will last long cause my last one broke in a month. Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok. It did shine my nails up some, but it was a bit clunky.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say, it works and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take off one star because the mini buffer, when is that ever useful?  My nails certainly aren&#x27;t that small and it just sits in a corner collecting dust.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to write this review to see how well these held up.  They are holding up well and I have used them often as I never wear polish, I just use these and I look like I have a gorgeous french manicure.  The file/buff works great.  Be careful not to over buff as that will make your nails weak.  I love the travel size fits nicely into my small handbag.</li>
            <li> I was going to use this as a gift, but was disppointed I ended up keeping them and buying something else.</li>
            <li> The mrs uses the big one for calluses on the feet.  Only lasts about 5 times then it is a throw away.  The other lasts forever.  Better to sell separately.</li>
            <li> Did not keep together. And the small one&#x27;s &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; will barely file ANYTHING.  I&#x27;d recommend a different brand.Just saying.... thanks</li>
            <li> It came with the large one with evrything you need to file your nails profesionally and a smaller one to put in your purse when you need a fast fix and never have a file. Great deal thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this nail buffer for two weeks and have used it twice.  Already there are several spots on each side that have been worn smooth and are therefore completely useless for shaping nails.  I&#x27;m on to something better...probably a glass nail file that will actually last through more than two uses.</li>
            <li> I like this product for pedicure and manicure, everything is right there and handy.  The product takes out those ridges I do not like on my nails.</li>
            <li> This product works great... almost too great. The first time I used it, I filed down too much because I am used to the cheaper buffers that really don&#x27;t work. The 7 steps are a little time consuming but it is well worth the results. I have never seen my nails so smooth and shiny. I had recently removed my acrylic nails and my natural nails looked horrible. I used the buffer and applied some nail straightener and they have never looked so good after removal. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sort of an unusual item - I wish it would have included better instructions rather than having to do a few trial and errors and ruining some of the product.  Finally we watched an instructional video someone had done on the popular internet video portal - and there we found how to best use the product.  Once we understood how to work this better we were satisfied, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
