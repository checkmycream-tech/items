            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the scents of Dominica, Krampert&#x27;s, Captain&#x27;s Choice, Layrite, Ogallala, and even Superior 40 over this.</li>

            <li>(and that&#x27;s a good thing).</li>

            <li>She says I&#x27;m very special and loves to be close to me, sometimes without even realizing that I&#x27;m using a great, manly fragrance.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this!</li>
            <li>this is still one of my top 5!</li>
            <li>The ladies love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this scent for years, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this !</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Smells mostly like cinnamon and cloves which I find pleasant and \\&quot;different\\&quot; in an aftershave.</li>
            <li>A great, unobtrusive scent, that stands strongly apart from the overpowering omnipresence of Axe, Polo, etc.</li>
            <li>It would seem to me that it&#x27;s tailored to a black man&#x27;s body chemistry, because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, but it&#x27;s perfect for Eric, my best friend.  </li>
            <li>Feels Amazing on shaved balls.</li>
            <li>Burns like gasoline and makes you smell like a Christmas cake, and once the burn fades you feel nice and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is for the person that makes their own path.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the smell also.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, barbershop smell.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a nice change from your every day colognes and after shaves.</li>
            <li>It feels nice after the save and has a lingering scent that is not over-powering.  </li>
            <li>but then it mellows out into a nice spicy scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves me smelling exotic, spicy and just darn good.</li>
            <li>&quot; warm nights dancing in a Puerto Rican discotheque, snapper and fried plaintains, and listening to a hundred coquis singing in the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clubman product smells like my Bay Rum of yore, lasts well, is loaded with alcohol, so it cools (or ablates) your skin after a nice, close, shave.</li>
            <li>The smell is a warm combination of clove and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>The feeling of alcohol on the face is a nice way to wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Great spicy smell, manly and clean.</li>
            <li>Good value strongly recommed the product.</li>
            <li>The scent is more of cloves and cinnamon, but it is a wonderful scent that lasts the whole day...</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger after shave is great.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick at great price.</li>
            <li>I must say this goes on VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With his hands still dripping of this beautifully spicy and exotic, bay tree filled far-away-tropical-paradise smelling after shave, he would then rub my cheeks, the top of my ears and head with the excess</li>
            <li>That smells pretty darn good!  </li>
            <li>Yes folks, this superb lotion comes in a cheap plastic bottle that nearly always cracks, either in shipment, or the first time you pack it on a suitcase, soaking your nice ties in Bay Rum with a formulation perfectly suited for turning that Brooks Brothers masterpiece into a Jerry Garcia Wannabe knockoff.</li>
            <li>and wow am i impressed.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on this bay rum, wasn&#x27;t sure about trying, however, purchased it so I could make up my own mind.</li>
            <li>Its smells nice and is  refreshing,  when splashed on after shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice item and will buy more when this is gone</li>
            <li>Just right and feels great after I shave.</li>
            <li>Out of the bottle the bay rum is strong!</li>
            <li>Great manly scent &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but after a couple of minutes there is a very comfortable warming effect.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and seems to me to be as good as the high priced alternatives in the exclusive men&#x27;s stores.</li>
            <li>My friend liked it just fine.  </li>
            <li>Clubman original and clubman reserve are 10x better!</li>
            <li>I found this of course on Amazaon and just love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent traditional sent.</li>
            <li>Love Bay Rum aftershave.  </li>

            <li>great thing about Clubman BR (aside from the fact that it makes you smell like a MAN) is that it is really inexpensive.</li>

            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I really do love the smell of this stuff once I got used to it.</li>

            <li>I thought it would be better.</li>

            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>so I am not 100% sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it as more of a body splash and refresher.  </li>
            <li>though I like Original Clubman much better!  </li>
            <li>The scent of Clubman Bay Rum is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay a buck or two more for &amp;#34;Bay Rum Premium now in glass bottle&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>Find a glass bottle of Eau de Skunque at the Dollar Store, pour it out, rinse with alcohol and decant your precious Bay Rum into that as soon as it arrives from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t feel very strongly on most &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; I buy.</li>
            <li>I would categorize this more as a cologne than an aftershave (if there is a difference?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Well, something is better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women love bay rum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li>it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li>Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li>but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a good 3-4 hours as an aftershave should and will tone my face nicely after a DE razor shave or a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like wine mulling spices, is the best way to put it, with extremely noticeable overtones of cinnamon and allspice.  </li>
            <li>The scent is unique -- one which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Great bay rum scent and classic sting upon application.</li>
            <li>I love this oldie but goodie , reminds me of Santa at the beach after Christmas , very nutmeggy (( is that a word )) with cinnamon and warm vanilla cookies !</li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes I find it to be as pleasant as they come and a nice change of pace.    </li>
            <li>it works good on my razor burn and leaves my face feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>that said, the Clubman brand IS pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, but disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>Light-medium and spicy/stimulating, or extremely strong but more subtle/muted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a scent I easily remember with a splash on &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that is refreshing after a close shave.  </li>
            <li>it gives a nice fresh feeling on your face, it isn&#x27;t over powering and stays with you most of the day.</li>
            <li>definitely the best Bay Rum I&#x27;ve ever tried, although the original will suit most people fine.</li>
            <li>Has a real nice fragrance leaves my face feeling very good after a good shave,have reccomended to other wet shavers</li>

            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and unique.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order this Clubman scent, as I love the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve several comments on how good I smell!  </li>
            <li>I like it more than the original CP.</li>
            <li>Her favorite is still the vanilla, followed closely by the original.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in the tonic that goes on super smooth and feels refreshing and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in the tonic that goes on super smooth and feels refreshing and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>This Virgin Islands&#x27; blend is a welcome change from the more recent overbearing scents.  </li>
            <li>Aftershave is supposed to smell clean, refreshing and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine how strong it would be if I splashed this stuff all over my face (or body as the instructions suggest).  </li>
            <li>Spicy, a hint of vanilla, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is strong with clove and cinnamon</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t too strong but does linger for a bit after application.</li>
            <li>Classic smell and feels good on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li>SO strong that I am using it on my boat as a deodorant but not for use on your face.</li>
            <li>I can now report that it is too strong for my wife and I.  </li>
            <li>4 months going strong.</li>
            <li>The sweet and spicy is something that I have fallen in love with in this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda nice, isn&#x27;t it?&amp;#34; Be aware it is alcohol based so it will sting like the dickens if you nicked yourself while shaving.</li>
            <li>Definitely was worth buying and was happy with the product, but with the smell being so strong, it seemed more of a odor than a refreshing after shave.</li>
            <li>Clubman always make a fine product.</li>
            <li>This is another fine fine product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light and easy fragrace.</li>
            <li>Not to strong a smell and not to light.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent , not overpowering , not expensive .</li>
            <li>This is office friendly, no one else will be able to smell it unless they get super close.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best scent ive had so far.</li>
            <li>This is a great aftershave if you enjoy clove in your bay rum, which I definitely do!</li>
            <li>I think the man in your life would enjoy it as well</li>
            <li>It smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh.</li>
            <li>It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheap.</li>
            <li>The bottle was cheap plastic, and felt like it would fall apart upon arrival.</li>
            <li>Light Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li>and yes it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and</li>
            <li>Works great as a REAL manly cologn; simple, spicy, and effective.  </li>
            <li>some cheap cologne that you&#x27;d buy at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li>Has a great scent, only lasts about one hour.</li>
            <li>razor burn free.</li>
            <li>Overall a great scent that can be used for any occasion</li>
            <li>OF THE +*%-^@*% CHEAP PLASTIC BOTTLE</li>
            <li>Although the smell was fantastic, I do not believe the smell is for me.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I ordered a twelve ounce (355 ml)</li>
            <li>A prodict of the good old days.</li>
            <li>Priced well, smells great, and an absolute classic.  </li>
            <li>Being a huge fan of the original Pinaud Clubman</li>
            <li>It smells like a old barber shop , feels great first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a strong burn that quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>Cheap after shave, good price, great smell, short lasting (you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li>Ok, I can live with that, being more safety-conscious in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not overpowering after a few minutes, but a nice, pleasant lingering smell the rest of your day.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with original clubman aftershave.</li>
            <li>Got this for my dad he loves the bay rum sent he used to get the original in the islands</li>
            <li>this is the closest I can find to the original</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique fragrance</li>
            <li>(My vote is still with the original)</li>
            <li>Stick to the original Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique in this day and age.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy in the past with St. John&#x27;s Virgin Islands Bay Rum</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than to be slapped with bay rum after a hot shave.</li>
            <li>On the whole, This is an excellent, inexpensive aftershave with a classic masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It is not as nice smelling as the Royall Bay Rum, but for the price it is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very distinctive, and I could easily see some people loving it and some people absolutely hating it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit strong - you know, like when you go to the airport in Las Vegas and wind up sitting next to the guy from some mega-city who believes, as do all the people with whom he associates, that more aftershave is better?  </li>
            <li>His father always wore it so it was special for him.</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li>I know the stuff works because I&#x27;ve had more women interested in me since I started using it! ;)</li>
            <li>Bay Rum is reasonably priced and pleasantly cool and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li>That would be cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like Old Spice -</li>
            <li>the stuff wont kill you with overpowering scent and it will last a good hour.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I&#x27;ve found to that old time scent I liked</li>
            <li>This is a low cost good smelling bay rum, its not ST.Johns</li>
            <li>I started shaving with a straight razor and figured I might as well get an appropriate aftershave.</li>
            <li>The sweet smell comes from benzene which is carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>It is Spicy and Sweet.</li>
            <li>applying, my wife inquired whether I had just sprayed the Christmas spray in the bathroom, because the smell was sweet, full of cloves, cinnamon, and a touch of rum.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of my favorite fragrances - I really like it.  </li>
            <li>These are both pretty musky and old man-ish, but were good for my budget and did the job.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, considering that I didn&#x27;t want to spend $45 for 4 oz.,</li>
            <li>There is strong \\&quot;tingle on the skin when first splashed on the face from the alcohol in the product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s strong at first.</li>
            <li>As it was I was going for a Super Saver order so added this item.  </li>
            <li>but the scent was mild and indistinct.  </li>
            <li>Pinaud is an old, reliable company that makes good products with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product, like so many aftershaves it only lasts an hour or so, but</li>
            <li>Now granted I apparently have a more sensitive nose then most, but this stuff smells stronger than most detergents.  </li>
            <li>The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li>The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting a good Bay Rum aftershave for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It may seem a tad bit pricey, but one bottle lasts a good long time provided you&#x27;re not too liberal with it.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, and leaves a clean, refreshing after-scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...</li>
            <li>it feel the same with its silky smooth texture along with its unique soothing, cooling and refreshing tingle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If she doesn&#x27;t love it then you need to find a new woman.</li>
            <li>The purchase and delivery was easy and fast</li>
            <li>It burns and soothes at the same time after a good hot shave.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it, she&#x27;s in disbelief that a man can smell so good ;)</li>
            <li>I have only two minor complaints about this otherwise excellent product: 1.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a more traditional bay rum aftershave I still enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the Old Spice and Brut drying out my face immediately, which I could live with because it felt so good to put on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the Old Spice and Brut drying out my face immediately, which I could live with because it felt so good to put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on pretty strong, and if you just shaved itll burn like napalm when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff lasts a long time, smells like classic Bay Rum should, inexpencive and lasts.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, sharp spicy aroma, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>for function, it works very well - will light your face on fire and tighten the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my favorite from what Ogallala offers and</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who remembers and enjoyed the old time barber shop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering, but it&#x27;s not subtle either.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like the way they smack you in the face after a fresh DE razor shave.</li>
            <li>I surely did not expect the soft, semi-moisturized feeling of the bay rum.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells nearly as powerful.</li>
            <li>I reduced one star mainly because the clove fragrance is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And most importantly, did it smell the same with</li>
            <li>Fresh and manly for the rest of my errands before going home.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanna smell fresh, spicy and manly for the ladies?  </li>
            <li>But real men (and their real women) love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a great scent for a 25 year old male.  </li>
            <li>especially given the kind of gunk I&#x27;d get (in bulk) for birthdays, Christmas and for some reason, Easter.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and masculine...</li>
            <li>Got a nice Bay Rum with essential oils smell to it.</li>
            <li>It was pleasantly surprised that the smell lasts most of the work day.</li>
            <li>Natural &amp; refreshing</li>
            <li>This is by far, my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li>My favorite Bay Rum after shave so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased a large sample pack containg all of Pinaud&#x27;s scents after rediscovering the original Clubman.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone out there might love it, but I didnt, mainly because I had a certain expectation of what it was going to smel like and Clubman didnt deliver.</li>
            <li>It fades pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this has the proper fragrance, as my tried and true favorite, Caswell-Massy&#x27;s Michelson Bay Rum, seems to have died the death of so many of Caswell-Massey&#x27;s old prduct line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is right, too.</li>
            <li>Wonderful old time fragrance yet not overwhelming. .</li>
            <li>I just want a fresh aftershave with a mild scent that can last most of the day...</li>
            <li>Winds down after 15 minutes to a Nice smooth scent.</li>
            <li>It is cool and bracing when splashed on and is somewhat &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; in the simplicity of its spicy island odor as opposed to the emergence of modern laboratory inspired floral concoctions.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, is inexpensive and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I eventually went to Aqua Velva (long, TMI story there) and in the interim, they quit selling the Bay Rum I liked.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of the original classic Clubman Pinaud, but I wanted to try something new for the customers.</li>
            <li>Classy, strong, manly (not flowery)</li>
            <li>Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li>There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant and manly while not too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li>This Bay Rum is has a classic, masculine and spicey aroma that cools and smells great for a few hours without being overly strong.</li>
            <li>did it look the same with that light brown yet rich looking brown color?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can live with the plastic reminder bottle of its original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use razorock first and then the bay rum.</li>
            <li>But to me, it smells very simple, mostly just cloves is all I smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stupidly expensive, so why not give it a try?</li>
            <li>My first journey into Ed Pinaud</li>
            <li>I kid you not when I say that when the first scent of this stuff hit my nostrils, I smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a whiskey connoisseur I implemented my seasoned olfactory skills to see what this concoction had to offer.</li>
            <li>Upon first whiff of course you get the standout notes: clove and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I was weary about this stuff when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>almost skunkish at first with cinnamon scent added to it.</li>
            <li>This Bay Rum is incredible, it serves for a common cold, pains, massages, it is the greatest....</li>
            <li>Remember, as with most traditional colognes, a drop just below each ear is all you need.</li>
            <li>This is my first Bay Rum purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I would most definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased Bay Rum it was probably on a discount table</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Umm, it&#x27;s a hot Christmas drink made of oranges and cinnamon (and</li>
            <li>In contrast to those who criticize this as not smelling like the old stuff, it seems genuine to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found one or two better.</li>
            <li>They wrap it in Saran Wrap pretty well, so</li>
            <li>My wife at first equated the smell to christmas and gingerbread men.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever had this put on me was at Anthony&#x27;s Barbershop in Sacramento CA.</li>
            <li>If I were to suggest a bay rum, Dominica with Lime would be my first choice.  </li>
            <li>but the price has gone up way beyond what I am willing to pay.</li>
            <li>, my first impression was that it smelled like a skunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; I did noticed  more favorable interactions with members of the opposite sex while wearing it,  just not my wife.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li>Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is my first \\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot; aftershave experience.  </li>
            <li>Take that with absolute seriousness, because they were right.</li>
            <li>but Clubman got this right at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think the price is excellent and the size is more than big enough to last a long while.</li>
            <li>I really liked the fresh feeling of the Suavecito after my morning shave, but was looking for something that lasted a little bit longer with regards to the scent.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I used it I was surprised at how gentle the scent is compared to Clubman (which must seem ironic since just below this review is someone complaining about how strong the smell is -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, fresh-shaved, adult scent.</li>
            <li>I am another one of those old school types who prefer the more traditional Old Spice type scents over the \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents of most modern aftershaves and colognes.  </li>
            <li>The odor is a little more cloying than I remember and seems to hang on far longer than most after shave lotions.  </li>
            <li>I got used to it pretty quick, and the scent completely makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>I felt positively grown up; yes I did.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this fine old world type product.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes the smell and she would be the first to tell me otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells (manly, but not old)</li>
            <li>I love to smell it on my husband&#x27;s face all day long.  </li>
            <li>Lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>This one is nice, but it fades enough after four hours to need a few more drops.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not normally my preference, it is a nice, clean sent, definitely of a by-gone age</li>
            <li>Refreshing, classic scent with that alcohol wake-up call that says to your skin &amp;#34;it&#x27;s morning OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Could smell that tiny drop from 1 ft away easy.  </li>
            <li>I like bay rum generally, and think that the regular Clubman aftershave and talc smell nice</li>
            <li>Has that typical burn to it after a fresh shave, but does smell good (if a little strong).</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands and this particular Bay Rum, is great.</li>
            <li>bottle is a little cheap, but works fine if you don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li>Nice little sting after shaving.</li>
            <li>Bay Rum is kinda hard to describe - but it is good.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, chemical smelling, and doesn&#x27;t last.    </li>
            <li>What a rush and really completes the whole shave</li>
            <li>Well it lasted forever and didn&#x27;t die much.  </li>
            <li>Almost twice as much for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It was mailed very promptly</li>
            <li>Very Spicy Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li>However, I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m talking real deal manly delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells intense, but once on the skin</li>
            <li>The smell is very chemical and perfumy.</li>
            <li>thank ou so much, you&#x27;ve made my day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s off to work in the real world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep looking until I find the real deal.</li>
            <li>the real test was what was inside that bottle...</li>
            <li>i dared him to take it to work and leave it in the men&#x27;s room and watch how fast it was used up - about 1/2 way gone and stayed that way.  </li>
            <li>Some folks absolutely swear by this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am astounded at how well it tones my face after shaving with my straight razors.</li>
            <li>I think I just cannot get over the spice tones and much prefer the Pinaud Citrus Musk or Osage Rub but thinking it is just me.</li>
            <li>That made me very cautious of the Pinuad brand to start based on the reviews, but I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and if for some reason you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you won&#x27;t be out a fortune for having tried it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my scalp, face, back, etc., and enjoy the fragrance and tingly feel that it leaves.</li>
            <li>Very spicy.  </li>
            <li>Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li>You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li>and you could see the several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>and you could see the several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried fancier (and much costlier) aftershaves and found that they were just too perfumey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those old school scents that takes you back to a better time.  </li>
            <li>I suppose that will suffice for a few minutes, but if you&#x27;re wanting to smell manly, trustworthy and rugged all day, get a nice generous splash and smack it on your cheeks and neck, and get something to fend off your wife or girlfriend with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this nearly a year and still have a good third left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>A little high on the alcohol side, the scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cheap that has a classic, old-fashioned barbershop smell, go for the regular Clubman aftershave ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It works well against razor burn, better than any other splash I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly what I was expecting, though it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Other people seem to love it, though.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.</li>
            <li>I first had Clubman splashed on my face in a barber shop when I was 4 years old, in 1944!  </li>
            <li>Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum is my idea of a simple, straightforward spicy aroma for a man.</li>
            <li>This stuff is extremely strong and spicy/stimulating; and I mean strong.  </li>
            <li>This is a very spicy scent, cinnamon and clove mainly and out of all of Pinaud&#x27;s offerings</li>
            <li>In fact, it has a clean scent similar to that found in high-end colognes.</li>
            <li>I doubt this will become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; after shave, but it is more than adequate and, for me, possesses a huge nostalgic attraction.</li>
            <li>I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.</li>
            <li>Bay rum reminds me of the good old days when getting a haircut meant climbing into an old \\&quot;Koken\\&quot; barber chair (guaranteed to withstand a nuclear blast) and having your hair trimmed by a man in a white smock who wasn&#x27;t timing you against his next cigarette.</li>
            <li>I also recommend the \\&quot;Special Reserve Double Strength Cologne\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t detect it a half-hour after application (try Ogallala Special Reserve Cologne for a stronger, longer lasting smell).    </li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old barber shops and hot moist towels after a hair cut.</li>
            <li>If you like a more traditional bay rum, heavy on the clove and light on the rum, this ones for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time when he was done carefully shaving and then cleaning the straight razor, along with the lathering cup and brush, he would look at himself in the mirror while stroking his cheeks to check for any missed spots while reaching for the clear glass bottle of Ed Pinaud&#x27;s CLUBMAN VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM Aftershave Splash and proceed to douse his face, neck and chest with a couple of healthy handfuls of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice is kind of like a British/Euro spicy aftershave while Clubman Bay Rum puts a little Irie in it.</li>
            <li>More or less is an inexpensive after shave.</li>
            <li>Classic scent, rugged and manly without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would say the smell is classic as my dad was wearing it in the fifties.  </li>
            <li>Scent is a personal thing, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different Bay Rum aftershaves and this has the most classic smell to my nose.     </li>
            <li>However, the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum smells nothing like the classic Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li>If you want an awsome classic Bay Rum scent go and buy Stephan&#x27;s Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this for my fiancé.</li>
            <li>I use the classic Clubman and thought I&#x27;d try the Bay Rum scent.  </li>
            <li>It just has a particular odor.</li>
            <li>Not Subtle at all.</li>
            <li>I recently bought it in bulk, just to make sure I always have some on hand for daily use.</li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]), or the extremely classic</li>
            <li>Well, the Teacher couldn&#x27;t be outdone by the Pupil, so I found the a 6oz bottle of the Clubman classic scented aftershave, and all is well again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the oldschool sophistication of a classic scent</li>
            <li>When I first cracked the cap open on this thing I got a huge whiff of it within a second, and that was from a 1 ft away before I&#x27;d even removed the cap.  </li>
            <li>Half the fun of this aftershave is the cool ship on the label.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  </li>
            <li>my husbands favorites since high school,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wished it lasted a little longer, but it has more staying power than the competition.</li>
            <li>, it put you in mind of faraway places, trade winds, and white sands, a clean smell, an altogether masculine smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is due to its strong spicy note.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing aftershave that I recommend every guy try at least once.</li>
            <li>This product is straight up old fashion barbershop aftershave.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way too much cinnamon in the mix that completely overpowers the rest of the fragrance, it just smells like I&#x27;m putting on cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cheap plastic, I expected glass from the picture and the cost.</li>
            <li>Makes one think of the old barber shops where men were shaved with the straight razors.  </li>
            <li>The scent REALLY IS bay rum--and I&#x27;m not a heavy drinker.</li>
            <li>A real old genteel mans barber shop requirement.</li>
            <li>At first this was the least favorite of the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li>The fresh aroma was above my expectation.</li>
            <li>Bay Rum is complex, warm, woodsy and spicy but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just simply an aftershave with a distinct aroma.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li>I would learn to live with the price</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so it goes well with my beach attitude.</li>
            <li>Beware new shavers, this stuff will BURN when you put it on</li>
            <li>Mixed with witch hazel and some other secret ingredients, it makes a superb, and gentle aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, but it&#x27;s got enough of a kick for others to smell (and certainly appreciate!)</li>
            <li>Initial notes are reminiscent of cheap stocking-stuffer colognes that I remember as a kid, blended with Glade plugin and potpourri.  </li>
            <li>It is not long lasting, but is clean and spicy smelling.</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I purchased the larger 12oz size bottle, which looks almost exactly like the bottle from almost 50 years ago except</li>
            <li>Being an old guy- who cares!  </li>
            <li>Bay Rum comes from a presumably simpler, but no more innocent time.</li>
            <li>A little strong, but for the price, we can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong at first but mellows out after a few short minutes and lasts ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for both young and old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Go ahead and get an old Pan paperback copy of LIVE AND LET DIE and transport yourself to another time, another place.</li>
            <li>As for the scent itself, my first thought was \\&quot;old person\\&quot;, my second thought was \\&quot;overcompensating\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The scent will stay with you through most of the day though don&#x27;t expect anyone to really smell it several hours later unless they are extremely close.</li>
            <li>though nature decreed me to long since forego haircuts to the extent that shaving my pate is the smartest choice I can make, and even though I have a beard (now white as Father Neptune&#x27;s), I still enjoy splashing on the old bay rum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li>It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product was once common in most drug stores but no more.</li>
            <li>In the interest if domestic tranquility,  I&#x27;d check with your better half before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>understand that this (and the Pinaud / Clubman brand) has a large following, but I&#x27;ve just never found a product from them that I like.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic bottle to keep costs down but looks nice amongst my other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>(Given the CO is of a high caliber in general, I am loathe to decline.)</li>
            <li>Have to do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne, and as far as \\&quot;smelling like a man\\</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Overcompensating old person\\&quot; is not the image I want to project.</li>
            <li>This is not just for old dudes though, I&#x27;m 30</li>
            <li>I use prada, porasso, taylor of old bond street, ect....</li>
            <li>This is an old style scent, which reminds me of a barber shop.</li>
            <li>Old memories.</li>
            <li>It smells manly and classy</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>It smells like an old school barber shop to me.</li>
            <li>only thing I really dont like about it is the packaging.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that in the movie &amp;#34;The Exorcist&amp;#34;, the 2 priests performing the exorcism were not throwing Holy water on the young possessed girl; rather, they were throwing Clubman Bay Rum on her.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a straight razor and DE razor for the last five years.</li>
            <li>have given straight razor shaves to a couple of my mid twenties friends and finished up with the bay rum</li>
            <li>This reminds me of the old barber shop where I used to get my hair cut when I was a child.</li>
            <li>It is heavy on the alcohol burn which I tend to enjoy after a close shave.</li>
            <li>just smells masculine, no need to overcompensate.  </li>
            <li>A resurgence in D.E. shaving has also brought out the companions of old to authenticate the experience.</li>
            <li>This may make you smell like an old man, but it will make you smell like an old man that has to beat away the hordes of tail</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your Masculine Spicy almost Cinnamon , yet woodsy and Manly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Old Spice guy, but I find this to be pleasing</li>
            <li>Unlike Old Spice which fades out completely, this has a residual smell you will like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need or want something that is made by designers and metered out like liquid gold and sold to people with those 3 day old beards.</li>
            <li>wife and I are sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>And if it helps I am in my early 30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say it out loud.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the old fashioned or old school scent of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Bay Rum smells like a sweet dark rum.</li>
            <li>Bay rum doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of other Bay Rums out there, but this and Col Conks Bay Rum shave soap are the only two Ive found so far that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Things weren&#x27;t better then, but the memories you have of them mean the world to you.</li>
            <li>The twelve ounce bottle was half full.</li>
            <li>shave quite often, but am only used to the scent of original Old Spice, musk, and other old scents like these.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money compared to other bay rum after shaves.  </li>
            <li>when I read the other comments about how it is rely strong and the smell lasts to long</li>
            <li>It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful scent right when you apply it, but it mellows out within seconds leaving a subtle scent that lingers for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>But after that, there are more subtle varieties that bring out the complexity of the aftershave in tinges of vanilla, pepper, oak, maybe even leather?</li>
            <li>But this will fade as the day wears on and turn to a more subtle spice smell.</li>
            <li>imagine my shear delight when I recently came across this classic product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;YES...the color and overall look is exactly the same as I remember it from almost 50 years ago.</li>
            <li>.....................having burnt melted cinnamon &#x27;red hots&#x27; in your pocket on a hot summer day, and then reaching for your keys only to get that smell all over you.  </li>
            <li>I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Bay Rum is musky and spicy, and can be light to the casual sniffer, or more deep and complex when that special someone comes in close.</li>
            <li>I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find locally and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The only other cheap bay rum I would use is from Masters as its only $8 and has moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>...evokes fond memories of being a young boy sitting cross-legged on the bathroom counter and intently watching my grandfather&#x27;s every move as he methodically went through the machinations of his daily early morning</li>
            <li>Once the Old Spice Dad left behind ran out, I bought a bottle of Bay Rum at a drug store (where, at the time, it was sold next to Witch Hazel...) and always liked it--</li>
            <li>will tell you that for a few years now, I&#x27;ve been alternating between classic Old Spice (yes I know it&#x27;s not the original recipe so settle down) and Brut.</li>
            <li>As one who enjoys Bay Rum as an aftershave, I have found it hard to find Bay Rum these days especially at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I mean, WOW, if you have used the original then you already know).</li>
            <li>I believe there are two general routes.  </li>
            <li>Ogallala contains natural essential oils, not chemicals.    </li>
            <li>This makes me smell like a cross between an old man and a cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li>It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...</li>
            <li>It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...</li>
            <li>I smell like a mixture of an old barber shop and possibly the Virgin</li>
            <li>But Bay Rum has a distinctive, old fashioned aroma that calls to mind Key West, Hemingway, Cuba, mojitos, swimming in \\&quot;Stingray</li>
            <li>I encountered the product again on a recent visit to a golf club in the Caribbean sparking old memories and leading me to order a bottle online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li>Smells OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but really that just means you need to liberally apply it all over.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few days I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ran out of aftershave recently and decided to branch out for the same old same old.</li>
            <li>Not saying it&#x27;s bad, just be ready to smell kind of like a snack.</li>
            <li>I was not impressed because I smelled more chemicals than I did natural oils or bay leaves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks for the improved quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent when you first put it on reminds you a little of atomic fireballs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old-fashioned scent, now hard to find in your local mass-market drugstores, to young ladies reminiscent perhaps of their kindly old grandfathers, but still, it takes a rare man to buck modernity and give himself back to the classics:</li>
            <li>If you do like this, it has an advantage over the other Bay Rum&#x27;s I&#x27;ve mentioned, it last much longer.</li>
            <li>am always taken back to the days the barber would put a board across the seat in the barber shop and pick me up when I was 6 years old and shave the back of my neck a tiny bit and splash this by the handful on me.  </li>
            <li>The only women were those bringing the little ones for their first haircuts (remember booster seats?)</li>
            <li>Years later, I saw this in a CVS and bought a bottle and the Current Officeholder (AKA \\&quot;Wife #2\\&quot;) loves the stuff and allows no other.</li>
            <li>Bears the same relationship to real bay rum (rhum) as instant coffee does to brewed coffee - in other words</li>
            <li>; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the weak \\&quot;light spritz\\</li>
            <li>I had been unable to find anything I really liked since Old Spice was sold to P. &amp; G. and the formula changed or watered down.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but not exceptional, either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can also mean going to the Main St. barber shop and nervously getting into the steel and leather chair as all the older, grown men chuckle and rib you about \\&quot;when</li>
            <li>Well, the result is good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> What I discovered is that the aroma is perfectly redolent of spices.  </li>
            <li> I use it and give to my best friends for Gifts so get some now!    </li>
            <li> Wonderful spicy stuff.</li>
            <li> Great bay rum scent!</li>

            <li> But with the Pinaud Bay Rum it&#x27;s the best of both worlds.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the scents of Dominica, Krampert&#x27;s, Captain&#x27;s Choice, Layrite, Ogallala, and even Superior 40 over this.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for years, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this !</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Smells mostly like cinnamon and cloves which I find pleasant and \\&quot;different\\&quot; in an aftershave.</li>
            <li> A great, unobtrusive scent, that stands strongly apart from the overpowering omnipresence of Axe, Polo, etc.</li>
            <li> It would seem to me that it&#x27;s tailored to a black man&#x27;s body chemistry, because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, but it&#x27;s perfect for Eric, my best friend.  </li>
            <li> Feels Amazing on shaved balls.</li>
            <li> Burns like gasoline and makes you smell like a Christmas cake, and once the burn fades you feel nice and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is for the person that makes their own path.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the smell also.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, barbershop smell.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a nice change from your every day colognes and after shaves.</li>
            <li> It feels nice after the save and has a lingering scent that is not over-powering.  </li>
            <li> but then it mellows out into a nice spicy scent.</li>
            <li> It leaves me smelling exotic, spicy and just darn good.</li>
            <li> &quot; warm nights dancing in a Puerto Rican discotheque, snapper and fried plaintains, and listening to a hundred coquis singing in the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clubman product smells like my Bay Rum of yore, lasts well, is loaded with alcohol, so it cools (or ablates) your skin after a nice, close, shave.</li>
            <li> The smell is a warm combination of clove and cinnamon.</li>
            <li> The feeling of alcohol on the face is a nice way to wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great spicy smell, manly and clean.</li>
            <li> Good value strongly recommed the product.</li>
            <li> The scent is more of cloves and cinnamon, but it is a wonderful scent that lasts the whole day...</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger after shave is great.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick at great price.</li>
            <li> I must say this goes on VERY strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With his hands still dripping of this beautifully spicy and exotic, bay tree filled far-away-tropical-paradise smelling after shave, he would then rub my cheeks, the top of my ears and head with the excess</li>
            <li> That smells pretty darn good!  </li>
            <li> Yes folks, this superb lotion comes in a cheap plastic bottle that nearly always cracks, either in shipment, or the first time you pack it on a suitcase, soaking your nice ties in Bay Rum with a formulation perfectly suited for turning that Brooks Brothers masterpiece into a Jerry Garcia Wannabe knockoff.</li>
            <li> and wow am i impressed.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on this bay rum, wasn&#x27;t sure about trying, however, purchased it so I could make up my own mind.</li>
            <li> Its smells nice and is  refreshing,  when splashed on after shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice item and will buy more when this is gone</li>
            <li> Just right and feels great after I shave.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle the bay rum is strong!</li>
            <li> Great manly scent &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of minutes there is a very comfortable warming effect.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and seems to me to be as good as the high priced alternatives in the exclusive men&#x27;s stores.</li>
            <li> My friend liked it just fine.  </li>
            <li> Clubman original and clubman reserve are 10x better!</li>
            <li> I found this of course on Amazaon and just love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent traditional sent.</li>
            <li> Love Bay Rum aftershave.  </li>

            <li> great thing about Clubman BR (aside from the fact that it makes you smell like a MAN) is that it is really inexpensive.</li>

            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I really do love the smell of this stuff once I got used to it.</li>

            <li> so I am not 100% sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it as more of a body splash and refresher.  </li>
            <li> though I like Original Clubman much better!  </li>
            <li> The scent of Clubman Bay Rum is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay a buck or two more for &amp;#34;Bay Rum Premium now in glass bottle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I must say sometimes you get much more than you pay for.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Find a glass bottle of Eau de Skunque at the Dollar Store, pour it out, rinse with alcohol and decant your precious Bay Rum into that as soon as it arrives from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very strongly on most &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; I buy.</li>
            <li> I would categorize this more as a cologne than an aftershave (if there is a difference?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;Women love bay rum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li> it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li> Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li> but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a good 3-4 hours as an aftershave should and will tone my face nicely after a DE razor shave or a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like wine mulling spices, is the best way to put it, with extremely noticeable overtones of cinnamon and allspice.  </li>
            <li> The scent is unique -- one which I really liked.  </li>
            <li> Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great bay rum scent and classic sting upon application.</li>
            <li> I love this oldie but goodie , reminds me of Santa at the beach after Christmas , very nutmeggy (( is that a word )) with cinnamon and warm vanilla cookies !</li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes I find it to be as pleasant as they come and a nice change of pace.    </li>
            <li> it works good on my razor burn and leaves my face feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> that said, the Clubman brand IS pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, but disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> Light-medium and spicy/stimulating, or extremely strong but more subtle/muted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a scent I easily remember with a splash on &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that is refreshing after a close shave.  </li>
            <li> it gives a nice fresh feeling on your face, it isn&#x27;t over powering and stays with you most of the day.</li>
            <li> definitely the best Bay Rum I&#x27;ve ever tried, although the original will suit most people fine.</li>
            <li> Has a real nice fragrance leaves my face feeling very good after a good shave,have reccomended to other wet shavers</li>
            <li> Cheap, classic, smells great.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve several comments on how good I smell!  </li>
            <li> I like it more than the original CP.</li>
            <li> Her favorite is still the vanilla, followed closely by the original.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in the tonic that goes on super smooth and feels refreshing and healthy for your skin.</li>

            <li> This Virgin Islands&#x27; blend is a welcome change from the more recent overbearing scents.  </li>
            <li> Aftershave is supposed to smell clean, refreshing and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how strong it would be if I splashed this stuff all over my face (or body as the instructions suggest).  </li>
            <li> Spicy, a hint of vanilla, not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is strong with clove and cinnamon</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t too strong but does linger for a bit after application.</li>
            <li> Classic smell and feels good on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> SO strong that I am using it on my boat as a deodorant but not for use on your face.</li>
            <li> I can now report that it is too strong for my wife and I.  </li>
            <li> 4 months going strong.</li>
            <li> The sweet and spicy is something that I have fallen in love with in this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda nice, isn&#x27;t it?&amp;#34; Be aware it is alcohol based so it will sting like the dickens if you nicked yourself while shaving.</li>
            <li> Definitely was worth buying and was happy with the product, but with the smell being so strong, it seemed more of a odor than a refreshing after shave.</li>
            <li> Clubman always make a fine product.</li>
            <li> This is another fine fine product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light and easy fragrace.</li>
            <li> Not to strong a smell and not to light.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent , not overpowering , not expensive .</li>
            <li> This is office friendly, no one else will be able to smell it unless they get super close.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best scent ive had so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave if you enjoy clove in your bay rum, which I definitely do!</li>
            <li> I think the man in your life would enjoy it as well</li>
            <li> It smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh.</li>
            <li> It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheap.</li>
            <li> The bottle was cheap plastic, and felt like it would fall apart upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Light Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li> and yes it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and</li>
            <li> Works great as a REAL manly cologn; simple, spicy, and effective.  </li>
            <li> some cheap cologne that you&#x27;d buy at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li> Has a great scent, only lasts about one hour.</li>
            <li> razor burn free.</li>
            <li> Overall a great scent that can be used for any occasion</li>
            <li> OF THE +*%-^@*% CHEAP PLASTIC BOTTLE</li>
            <li> Although the smell was fantastic, I do not believe the smell is for me.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I ordered a twelve ounce (355 ml)</li>
            <li> A prodict of the good old days.</li>
            <li> Priced well, smells great, and an absolute classic.  </li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the original Pinaud Clubman</li>
            <li> It smells like a old barber shop , feels great first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a strong burn that quickly fades.  </li>
            <li> Cheap after shave, good price, great smell, short lasting (you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li> Ok, I can live with that, being more safety-conscious in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not overpowering after a few minutes, but a nice, pleasant lingering smell the rest of your day.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with original clubman aftershave.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad he loves the bay rum sent he used to get the original in the islands</li>
            <li> this is the closest I can find to the original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique fragrance</li>
            <li> (My vote is still with the original)</li>
            <li> Stick to the original Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li> The scent is unique in this day and age.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy in the past with St. John&#x27;s Virgin Islands Bay Rum</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than to be slapped with bay rum after a hot shave.</li>
            <li> On the whole, This is an excellent, inexpensive aftershave with a classic masculine scent.</li>
            <li> It is not as nice smelling as the Royall Bay Rum, but for the price it is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very distinctive, and I could easily see some people loving it and some people absolutely hating it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit strong - you know, like when you go to the airport in Las Vegas and wind up sitting next to the guy from some mega-city who believes, as do all the people with whom he associates, that more aftershave is better?  </li>
            <li> His father always wore it so it was special for him.</li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li> I know the stuff works because I&#x27;ve had more women interested in me since I started using it! ;)</li>
            <li> Bay Rum is reasonably priced and pleasantly cool and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li> That would be cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like Old Spice -</li>
            <li> the stuff wont kill you with overpowering scent and it will last a good hour.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I&#x27;ve found to that old time scent I liked</li>
            <li> This is a low cost good smelling bay rum, its not ST.Johns</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a straight razor and figured I might as well get an appropriate aftershave.</li>
            <li> The sweet smell comes from benzene which is carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> It is Spicy and Sweet.</li>
            <li> applying, my wife inquired whether I had just sprayed the Christmas spray in the bathroom, because the smell was sweet, full of cloves, cinnamon, and a touch of rum.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite fragrances - I really like it.  </li>
            <li> These are both pretty musky and old man-ish, but were good for my budget and did the job.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, considering that I didn&#x27;t want to spend $45 for 4 oz.,</li>
            <li> There is strong \\&quot;tingle on the skin when first splashed on the face from the alcohol in the product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s strong at first.</li>
            <li> As it was I was going for a Super Saver order so added this item.  </li>
            <li> but the scent was mild and indistinct.  </li>
            <li> Pinaud is an old, reliable company that makes good products with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, like so many aftershaves it only lasts an hour or so, but</li>
            <li> Now granted I apparently have a more sensitive nose then most, but this stuff smells stronger than most detergents.  </li>
            <li> The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li> The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a good Bay Rum aftershave for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a tad bit pricey, but one bottle lasts a good long time provided you&#x27;re not too liberal with it.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, and leaves a clean, refreshing after-scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...</li>
            <li> it feel the same with its silky smooth texture along with its unique soothing, cooling and refreshing tingle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If she doesn&#x27;t love it then you need to find a new woman.</li>
            <li> The purchase and delivery was easy and fast</li>
            <li> It burns and soothes at the same time after a good hot shave.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it, she&#x27;s in disbelief that a man can smell so good ;)</li>
            <li> I have only two minor complaints about this otherwise excellent product: 1.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a more traditional bay rum aftershave I still enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the Old Spice and Brut drying out my face immediately, which I could live with because it felt so good to put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the Old Spice and Brut drying out my face immediately, which I could live with because it felt so good to put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on pretty strong, and if you just shaved itll burn like napalm when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff lasts a long time, smells like classic Bay Rum should, inexpencive and lasts.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, sharp spicy aroma, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> for function, it works very well - will light your face on fire and tighten the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my favorite from what Ogallala offers and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who remembers and enjoyed the old time barber shop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering, but it&#x27;s not subtle either.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the way they smack you in the face after a fresh DE razor shave.</li>
            <li> I surely did not expect the soft, semi-moisturized feeling of the bay rum.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells nearly as powerful.</li>
            <li> I reduced one star mainly because the clove fragrance is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And most importantly, did it smell the same with</li>
            <li> Fresh and manly for the rest of my errands before going home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanna smell fresh, spicy and manly for the ladies?  </li>
            <li> But real men (and their real women) love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great scent for a 25 year old male.  </li>
            <li> especially given the kind of gunk I&#x27;d get (in bulk) for birthdays, Christmas and for some reason, Easter.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and masculine...</li>
            <li> Got a nice Bay Rum with essential oils smell to it.</li>
            <li> It was pleasantly surprised that the smell lasts most of the work day.</li>
            <li> Natural &amp; refreshing</li>
            <li> This is by far, my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li> My favorite Bay Rum after shave so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased a large sample pack containg all of Pinaud&#x27;s scents after rediscovering the original Clubman.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone out there might love it, but I didnt, mainly because I had a certain expectation of what it was going to smel like and Clubman didnt deliver.</li>
            <li> It fades pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this has the proper fragrance, as my tried and true favorite, Caswell-Massy&#x27;s Michelson Bay Rum, seems to have died the death of so many of Caswell-Massey&#x27;s old prduct line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful old time fragrance yet not overwhelming. .</li>
            <li> I just want a fresh aftershave with a mild scent that can last most of the day...</li>
            <li> Winds down after 15 minutes to a Nice smooth scent.</li>
            <li> It is cool and bracing when splashed on and is somewhat &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; in the simplicity of its spicy island odor as opposed to the emergence of modern laboratory inspired floral concoctions.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, is inexpensive and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I eventually went to Aqua Velva (long, TMI story there) and in the interim, they quit selling the Bay Rum I liked.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of the original classic Clubman Pinaud, but I wanted to try something new for the customers.</li>
            <li> Classy, strong, manly (not flowery)</li>
            <li> Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li> There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li> It is pleasant and manly while not too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum is has a classic, masculine and spicey aroma that cools and smells great for a few hours without being overly strong.</li>
            <li> did it look the same with that light brown yet rich looking brown color?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can live with the plastic reminder bottle of its original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use razorock first and then the bay rum.</li>
            <li> But to me, it smells very simple, mostly just cloves is all I smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stupidly expensive, so why not give it a try?</li>
            <li> My first journey into Ed Pinaud</li>
            <li> I kid you not when I say that when the first scent of this stuff hit my nostrils, I smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a whiskey connoisseur I implemented my seasoned olfactory skills to see what this concoction had to offer.</li>
            <li> Upon first whiff of course you get the standout notes: clove and cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I was weary about this stuff when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> almost skunkish at first with cinnamon scent added to it.</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum is incredible, it serves for a common cold, pains, massages, it is the greatest....</li>
            <li> Remember, as with most traditional colognes, a drop just below each ear is all you need.</li>
            <li> This is my first Bay Rum purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I would most definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Bay Rum it was probably on a discount table</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Umm, it&#x27;s a hot Christmas drink made of oranges and cinnamon (and</li>
            <li> In contrast to those who criticize this as not smelling like the old stuff, it seems genuine to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found one or two better.</li>
            <li> They wrap it in Saran Wrap pretty well, so</li>
            <li> My wife at first equated the smell to christmas and gingerbread men.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever had this put on me was at Anthony&#x27;s Barbershop in Sacramento CA.</li>
            <li> If I were to suggest a bay rum, Dominica with Lime would be my first choice.  </li>
            <li> but the price has gone up way beyond what I am willing to pay.</li>
            <li> , my first impression was that it smelled like a skunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I did noticed  more favorable interactions with members of the opposite sex while wearing it,  just not my wife.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li> Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is my first \\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot; aftershave experience.  </li>
            <li> Take that with absolute seriousness, because they were right.</li>
            <li> but Clubman got this right at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think the price is excellent and the size is more than big enough to last a long while.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fresh feeling of the Suavecito after my morning shave, but was looking for something that lasted a little bit longer with regards to the scent.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I used it I was surprised at how gentle the scent is compared to Clubman (which must seem ironic since just below this review is someone complaining about how strong the smell is -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, fresh-shaved, adult scent.</li>
            <li> I am another one of those old school types who prefer the more traditional Old Spice type scents over the \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents of most modern aftershaves and colognes.  </li>
            <li> The odor is a little more cloying than I remember and seems to hang on far longer than most after shave lotions.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it pretty quick, and the scent completely makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> I felt positively grown up; yes I did.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend this fine old world type product.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes the smell and she would be the first to tell me otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this smells (manly, but not old)</li>
            <li> I love to smell it on my husband&#x27;s face all day long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> This one is nice, but it fades enough after four hours to need a few more drops.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not normally my preference, it is a nice, clean sent, definitely of a by-gone age</li>
            <li> Refreshing, classic scent with that alcohol wake-up call that says to your skin &amp;#34;it&#x27;s morning OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Could smell that tiny drop from 1 ft away easy.  </li>
            <li> I like bay rum generally, and think that the regular Clubman aftershave and talc smell nice</li>
            <li> Has that typical burn to it after a fresh shave, but does smell good (if a little strong).</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and this particular Bay Rum, is great.</li>
            <li> bottle is a little cheap, but works fine if you don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li> Nice little sting after shaving.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum is kinda hard to describe - but it is good.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, chemical smelling, and doesn&#x27;t last.    </li>
            <li> What a rush and really completes the whole shave</li>
            <li> Well it lasted forever and didn&#x27;t die much.  </li>
            <li> Almost twice as much for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It was mailed very promptly</li>
            <li> Very Spicy Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li> However, I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m talking real deal manly delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells intense, but once on the skin</li>
            <li> The smell is very chemical and perfumy.</li>
            <li> thank ou so much, you&#x27;ve made my day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s off to work in the real world.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep looking until I find the real deal.</li>
            <li> the real test was what was inside that bottle...</li>
            <li> i dared him to take it to work and leave it in the men&#x27;s room and watch how fast it was used up - about 1/2 way gone and stayed that way.  </li>
            <li> Some folks absolutely swear by this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am astounded at how well it tones my face after shaving with my straight razors.</li>
            <li> I think I just cannot get over the spice tones and much prefer the Pinaud Citrus Musk or Osage Rub but thinking it is just me.</li>
            <li> That made me very cautious of the Pinuad brand to start based on the reviews, but I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The price is very affordable and if for some reason you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you won&#x27;t be out a fortune for having tried it.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my scalp, face, back, etc., and enjoy the fragrance and tingly feel that it leaves.</li>
            <li> Very spicy.  </li>
            <li> Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li> You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li> and you could see the several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> and you could see the several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried fancier (and much costlier) aftershaves and found that they were just too perfumey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those old school scents that takes you back to a better time.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that will suffice for a few minutes, but if you&#x27;re wanting to smell manly, trustworthy and rugged all day, get a nice generous splash and smack it on your cheeks and neck, and get something to fend off your wife or girlfriend with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this nearly a year and still have a good third left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> A little high on the alcohol side, the scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cheap that has a classic, old-fashioned barbershop smell, go for the regular Clubman aftershave ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It works well against razor burn, better than any other splash I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I was expecting, though it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Other people seem to love it, though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.</li>
            <li> I first had Clubman splashed on my face in a barber shop when I was 4 years old, in 1944!  </li>
            <li> Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum is my idea of a simple, straightforward spicy aroma for a man.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely strong and spicy/stimulating; and I mean strong.  </li>
            <li> This is a very spicy scent, cinnamon and clove mainly and out of all of Pinaud&#x27;s offerings</li>
            <li> In fact, it has a clean scent similar to that found in high-end colognes.</li>
            <li> I doubt this will become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; after shave, but it is more than adequate and, for me, possesses a huge nostalgic attraction.</li>
            <li> I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.</li>
            <li> Bay rum reminds me of the good old days when getting a haircut meant climbing into an old \\&quot;Koken\\&quot; barber chair (guaranteed to withstand a nuclear blast) and having your hair trimmed by a man in a white smock who wasn&#x27;t timing you against his next cigarette.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the \\&quot;Special Reserve Double Strength Cologne\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t detect it a half-hour after application (try Ogallala Special Reserve Cologne for a stronger, longer lasting smell).    </li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old barber shops and hot moist towels after a hair cut.</li>
            <li> If you like a more traditional bay rum, heavy on the clove and light on the rum, this ones for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time when he was done carefully shaving and then cleaning the straight razor, along with the lathering cup and brush, he would look at himself in the mirror while stroking his cheeks to check for any missed spots while reaching for the clear glass bottle of Ed Pinaud&#x27;s CLUBMAN VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM Aftershave Splash and proceed to douse his face, neck and chest with a couple of healthy handfuls of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Spice is kind of like a British/Euro spicy aftershave while Clubman Bay Rum puts a little Irie in it.</li>
            <li> More or less is an inexpensive after shave.</li>
            <li> Classic scent, rugged and manly without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I would say the smell is classic as my dad was wearing it in the fifties.  </li>
            <li> Scent is a personal thing, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different Bay Rum aftershaves and this has the most classic smell to my nose.     </li>
            <li> However, the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum smells nothing like the classic Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li> If you want an awsome classic Bay Rum scent go and buy Stephan&#x27;s Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this for my fiancé.</li>
            <li> I use the classic Clubman and thought I&#x27;d try the Bay Rum scent.  </li>
            <li> It just has a particular odor.</li>
            <li> Not Subtle at all.</li>
            <li> I recently bought it in bulk, just to make sure I always have some on hand for daily use.</li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]), or the extremely classic</li>
            <li> Well, the Teacher couldn&#x27;t be outdone by the Pupil, so I found the a 6oz bottle of the Clubman classic scented aftershave, and all is well again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the oldschool sophistication of a classic scent</li>
            <li> When I first cracked the cap open on this thing I got a huge whiff of it within a second, and that was from a 1 ft away before I&#x27;d even removed the cap.  </li>
            <li> Half the fun of this aftershave is the cool ship on the label.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  </li>
            <li> my husbands favorites since high school,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wished it lasted a little longer, but it has more staying power than the competition.</li>
            <li> , it put you in mind of faraway places, trade winds, and white sands, a clean smell, an altogether masculine smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is due to its strong spicy note.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing aftershave that I recommend every guy try at least once.</li>
            <li> This product is straight up old fashion barbershop aftershave.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s way too much cinnamon in the mix that completely overpowers the rest of the fragrance, it just smells like I&#x27;m putting on cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cheap plastic, I expected glass from the picture and the cost.</li>
            <li> Makes one think of the old barber shops where men were shaved with the straight razors.  </li>
            <li> The scent REALLY IS bay rum--and I&#x27;m not a heavy drinker.</li>
            <li> A real old genteel mans barber shop requirement.</li>
            <li> At first this was the least favorite of the Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> The fresh aroma was above my expectation.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum is complex, warm, woodsy and spicy but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simply an aftershave with a distinct aroma.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li> I would learn to live with the price</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so it goes well with my beach attitude.</li>
            <li> Beware new shavers, this stuff will BURN when you put it on</li>
            <li> Mixed with witch hazel and some other secret ingredients, it makes a superb, and gentle aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, but it&#x27;s got enough of a kick for others to smell (and certainly appreciate!)</li>
            <li> Initial notes are reminiscent of cheap stocking-stuffer colognes that I remember as a kid, blended with Glade plugin and potpourri.  </li>
            <li> It is not long lasting, but is clean and spicy smelling.</li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I purchased the larger 12oz size bottle, which looks almost exactly like the bottle from almost 50 years ago except</li>
            <li> Being an old guy- who cares!  </li>
            <li> Bay Rum comes from a presumably simpler, but no more innocent time.</li>
            <li> A little strong, but for the price, we can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong at first but mellows out after a few short minutes and lasts ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for both young and old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Go ahead and get an old Pan paperback copy of LIVE AND LET DIE and transport yourself to another time, another place.</li>
            <li> As for the scent itself, my first thought was \\&quot;old person\\&quot;, my second thought was \\&quot;overcompensating\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The scent will stay with you through most of the day though don&#x27;t expect anyone to really smell it several hours later unless they are extremely close.</li>
            <li> though nature decreed me to long since forego haircuts to the extent that shaving my pate is the smartest choice I can make, and even though I have a beard (now white as Father Neptune&#x27;s), I still enjoy splashing on the old bay rum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li> It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product was once common in most drug stores but no more.</li>
            <li> In the interest if domestic tranquility,  I&#x27;d check with your better half before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> understand that this (and the Pinaud / Clubman brand) has a large following, but I&#x27;ve just never found a product from them that I like.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic bottle to keep costs down but looks nice amongst my other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> (Given the CO is of a high caliber in general, I am loathe to decline.)</li>
            <li> Have to do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne, and as far as \\&quot;smelling like a man\\</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Overcompensating old person\\&quot; is not the image I want to project.</li>
            <li> This is not just for old dudes though, I&#x27;m 30</li>
            <li> I use prada, porasso, taylor of old bond street, ect....</li>
            <li> This is an old style scent, which reminds me of a barber shop.</li>
            <li> Old memories.</li>
            <li> It smells manly and classy</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> It smells like an old school barber shop to me.</li>
            <li> only thing I really dont like about it is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that in the movie &amp;#34;The Exorcist&amp;#34;, the 2 priests performing the exorcism were not throwing Holy water on the young possessed girl; rather, they were throwing Clubman Bay Rum on her.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a straight razor and DE razor for the last five years.</li>
            <li> have given straight razor shaves to a couple of my mid twenties friends and finished up with the bay rum</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the old barber shop where I used to get my hair cut when I was a child.</li>
            <li> It is heavy on the alcohol burn which I tend to enjoy after a close shave.</li>
            <li> just smells masculine, no need to overcompensate.  </li>
            <li> A resurgence in D.E. shaving has also brought out the companions of old to authenticate the experience.</li>
            <li> This may make you smell like an old man, but it will make you smell like an old man that has to beat away the hordes of tail</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your Masculine Spicy almost Cinnamon , yet woodsy and Manly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Old Spice guy, but I find this to be pleasing</li>
            <li> Unlike Old Spice which fades out completely, this has a residual smell you will like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need or want something that is made by designers and metered out like liquid gold and sold to people with those 3 day old beards.</li>
            <li> wife and I are sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> And if it helps I am in my early 30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it out loud.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the old fashioned or old school scent of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum smells like a sweet dark rum.</li>
            <li> Bay rum doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of other Bay Rums out there, but this and Col Conks Bay Rum shave soap are the only two Ive found so far that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> Things weren&#x27;t better then, but the memories you have of them mean the world to you.</li>
            <li> The twelve ounce bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> shave quite often, but am only used to the scent of original Old Spice, musk, and other old scents like these.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money compared to other bay rum after shaves.  </li>
            <li> when I read the other comments about how it is rely strong and the smell lasts to long</li>
            <li> It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful scent right when you apply it, but it mellows out within seconds leaving a subtle scent that lingers for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> But after that, there are more subtle varieties that bring out the complexity of the aftershave in tinges of vanilla, pepper, oak, maybe even leather?</li>
            <li> But this will fade as the day wears on and turn to a more subtle spice smell.</li>
            <li> imagine my shear delight when I recently came across this classic product...</li>
            <li> /&gt;YES...the color and overall look is exactly the same as I remember it from almost 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> .....................having burnt melted cinnamon &#x27;red hots&#x27; in your pocket on a hot summer day, and then reaching for your keys only to get that smell all over you.  </li>
            <li> I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum is musky and spicy, and can be light to the casual sniffer, or more deep and complex when that special someone comes in close.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The only other cheap bay rum I would use is from Masters as its only $8 and has moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> ...evokes fond memories of being a young boy sitting cross-legged on the bathroom counter and intently watching my grandfather&#x27;s every move as he methodically went through the machinations of his daily early morning</li>
            <li> Once the Old Spice Dad left behind ran out, I bought a bottle of Bay Rum at a drug store (where, at the time, it was sold next to Witch Hazel...) and always liked it--</li>
            <li> will tell you that for a few years now, I&#x27;ve been alternating between classic Old Spice (yes I know it&#x27;s not the original recipe so settle down) and Brut.</li>
            <li> As one who enjoys Bay Rum as an aftershave, I have found it hard to find Bay Rum these days especially at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I mean, WOW, if you have used the original then you already know).</li>
            <li> I believe there are two general routes.  </li>
            <li> Ogallala contains natural essential oils, not chemicals.    </li>
            <li> This makes me smell like a cross between an old man and a cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li> It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...</li>
            <li> It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...</li>
            <li> I smell like a mixture of an old barber shop and possibly the Virgin</li>
            <li> But Bay Rum has a distinctive, old fashioned aroma that calls to mind Key West, Hemingway, Cuba, mojitos, swimming in \\&quot;Stingray</li>
            <li> I encountered the product again on a recent visit to a golf club in the Caribbean sparking old memories and leading me to order a bottle online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> Smells OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but really that just means you need to liberally apply it all over.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ran out of aftershave recently and decided to branch out for the same old same old.</li>
            <li> Not saying it&#x27;s bad, just be ready to smell kind of like a snack.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed because I smelled more chemicals than I did natural oils or bay leaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks for the improved quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent when you first put it on reminds you a little of atomic fireballs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an old-fashioned scent, now hard to find in your local mass-market drugstores, to young ladies reminiscent perhaps of their kindly old grandfathers, but still, it takes a rare man to buck modernity and give himself back to the classics:</li>
            <li> If you do like this, it has an advantage over the other Bay Rum&#x27;s I&#x27;ve mentioned, it last much longer.</li>
            <li> am always taken back to the days the barber would put a board across the seat in the barber shop and pick me up when I was 6 years old and shave the back of my neck a tiny bit and splash this by the handful on me.  </li>
            <li> The only women were those bringing the little ones for their first haircuts (remember booster seats?)</li>
            <li> Years later, I saw this in a CVS and bought a bottle and the Current Officeholder (AKA \\&quot;Wife #2\\&quot;) loves the stuff and allows no other.</li>
            <li> Bears the same relationship to real bay rum (rhum) as instant coffee does to brewed coffee - in other words</li>
            <li> ; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the weak \\&quot;light spritz\\</li>
            <li> I had been unable to find anything I really liked since Old Spice was sold to P. &amp; G. and the formula changed or watered down.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but not exceptional, either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can also mean going to the Main St. barber shop and nervously getting into the steel and leather chair as all the older, grown men chuckle and rib you about \\&quot;when</li>
            <li> Well, the result is good and bad.  </li>
            <li> It may fade a little quick, but that beats &amp;#34;overwhelming&amp;#34; hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have used Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman after shave lotion in the past and it has a very strong scent; this Bay Rum smells like it is 50% Clubman - not at all the subtle scent I expect from a Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cinnamon heavy upon application, but it wears off a bit and balances out quickly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re willing to step out and try something different, even though it comes from times past, your find a zing to your night out!</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> A simple fragrance long overlooked.</li>
            <li> I dont think Ive ever paid double digits for a bottle, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, however.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it enough yet to see the effects after a long day.</li>
            <li> I first used this years ago and then had trouble finding it in stores-although I did buy other Clubman products.</li>
            <li> Despite what another reviewer says, this is not generally thought to be a long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> As much as she likes to buy me the more complex, newer style colognes, she still really likes the simple but cutting aroma that fills the air when I splash a little on.</li>
            <li> The scent can be a little overpowering at first, but it settles down after a while and becomes</li>
            <li> I mean, exactly like orange wassle.  </li>
            <li> The reason for the 4-star rating is because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like, which is a common problem with a lot of modern products like this.</li>
            <li> I give it two stars because it is not quite that bad, but does not smell suitable for a human face to me.  </li>
            <li> I really like to use it when it&#x27;s hot and muggy out, seems to take the Homeless-For-A-Month feeling away on those days.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive Bay Rums, but find Clubman&#x27;s to be fragrant enough but not cloyingly heavy.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I would smell just like grandpa&#x27;s aftershave all day long...</li>
            <li> You could smell the bayrum as soon as the box was open as it was wet from the bottle cracking and spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li> you can handle the perfumes and are in the market for a day long cologne/aftershave, then this product will probably work for you.  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pleasant at first,</li>
            <li> I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worlds apart from Axe, Tag, and other janky &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; that my generation uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other kinds of Bay Rum but always come back to Pinaud.</li>
            <li> That smell might remind you of grizzled, career barbers who could clipper cut your head with only one eye open, shave your neck, then smack a little this on your to make you feel</li>
            <li> The next star was lost due to finish.</li>
            <li> The next star was lost due to finish.</li>
            <li> The bad part is it only lasts at most for 3 hours before you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on.  </li>
            <li> But for you single guys out there-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I think of when I mean a classic barbershop scent.</li>
            <li> but it last about thirty minutes really not worth the money unless you use a bottle a day</li>
            <li> Everyone says you smell like an old crusty alcoholic.  </li>
            <li> That said, my wife dumped it down the drain and threatened me with severe bodily injury if I ever purchased it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy this again, but then a few weeks ago I was ready to stop using it.</li>
            <li> The bottle fell off the shelf yesterday breaking open and spilling half of it on the floor.</li>
            <li> Not particularly well packed, but the bottle did not break or crack</li>
            <li> But if you know the lyrics to a lot of Beatles tunes and remember black and white TV</li>
            <li> I can only describe the scent as cinnamon, spice and sugar (in that order) with none of the typical \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; smells.  </li>
            <li> This scent actually does smell a little bit like rum, however I noticed that the scent also smelled like</li>
            <li> I later experimented by spreading a small drop over one of my fingers and seeing how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough!</li>
            <li> unless you have an unemployed place-kicker working at your local UPS hub, the odds are there&#x27;ll be enough to decant for at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not outstanding or long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The corner of the bottle was crushed</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying this was not a real Bay Rum and after trying Captain&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li> fragrance is not modern, it is strictly old-school.</li>
            <li> have purchased a few different types/flavors of Bay Rum scents over the years, never finding &amp;#34;the right&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> It feels extra saucy when you have a few nicks.</li>
            <li> Seems I can only smell it for a few mins and end up over doing it to get the smell to last.&lt;br /&gt;Wetting</li>
            <li> I wish I got Lime Sec.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am partial to \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; fragrance</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> NOT A COMPLETE LET DOWN</li>
            <li> This bottle is much better than some other bay rum that we have purchased, the glass bottles are heavy and the stoppers are awkward...</li>
            <li> There is a strong but not altogether unpleasant burning when it is applied just after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about other men, but to me (and my wife, apparently) masculinity doesn&#x27;t smell like cloves and cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Subtle yet masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Lots of spice and rum smell, however if lasts a long time and mellows a little with time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has very little lasting power on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells a littler &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; than other bay rum after shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried colognes (including bay rum cologne), balms and other aftershaves, but none compare to this.</li>

            <li> Other favorites include Jockey Club (Caswell Massey).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pungent as other brands.</li>
            <li> maybe some other stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not in the market for a cologne due to my sensitivity to the perfumes.  </li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion as well as other Clubman Pinaud products, I decided to add a bottle of their Bay Rum to my shaving repertoire.  </li>
            <li> Bought anew, see other reviews.</li>
            <li> All Purpose Cologne Splash, 8 Ounce]], or some other brand.  </li>
            <li> But I would only try that if I&#x27;m not going to be around anyone for a few hours, before taking a shower!</li>
            <li> Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Many of the expensive, department store colognes smell like a stew of confused smells, anyway.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the smell doesn&#x27;t last past an hour.</li>
            <li> He has a tough beard, but due to his allergies, his skin is so sensitive, not even his DE safety razor could stop breakouts after every shave.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find bay rum in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has a scent that is love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like someone rubbed you down with clothes.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the drug store down the street</li>
            <li> Put down the Pinaud and try Ogallala.  </li>
            <li> I will have to figure out how to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> Burns all the way down, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clove heavy with some musk and chemicals and doesn&#x27;t resemble any other bay rum I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but less flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly spicy/complex - but not flowery or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Side note: couldn&#x27;t care less about the plastic bottle people are griping about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so it gives a slight burn.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight film on my face.</li>
            <li> Hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and clove - less &#x27;bay rum&#x27; than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipino</li>
            <li> This concoction is a murky mess of synthetic ingredients of dubious quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Clubman products, but this one didn&#x27;t exactly thrill me.  </li>
            <li> I tried sniffing it again several times to be sure I wasn&#x27;t just crazy, but it really smells nasty.  </li>
            <li> Use a little before you shave to kill any bacteria, etc.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing it for a few days now.</li>
            <li> Harsh stuff, drys your skin out in a flash and the burn feels like a chemical accident.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For me, I can smell the scent for a few hours after I put it on, then it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed after ordering it I found the same brand and bottle at my local chain drug store for less than half of what I paid.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like bay rum, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.otically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfume, and Bay Rum is hard to find in my little town.  </li>
            <li> its now WAY too clove-heavy with very little essence of bay tree and virtually zero cinnamon oil emanating from today&#x27;s formulation.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It does not smell bad but just does not have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> usually have to splash it on about 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> After a heavy workout I&#x27;ll splash some of this on my chest, arms, and hair and BAM!  </li>
            <li> I love all of Clubman products but this one is nasty.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the product, I was so anxious to get a smell.</li>
            <li> No better body splash than this stuff.</li>
            <li> Since I gave him my bottle of Virgin Island Bay Rum, he&#x27;s had no more breakouts, and</li>
            <li> : Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very heavy on spice/clove notes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on here that state \\&quot;one drop behind each ear\\&quot;, etc.</li>
            <li> The barber would always slap a little Bay Rum on the back of my neck after cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> This is  not apparent with each application, but is sometimes slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> ...it seems to be lighter-bodied now with hardly any cooling sensation, though it is still quite soothing and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did use the remainder of the bottle to start fires in my wood stove which is why I gave it at least a 1 star.</li>
            <li> The artificial coloring makes it pour with a hue of blue when it leaves the bottle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heady exotically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of</li>
            <li> &quot; on the table in the uncomfortable waiting area where the sun blazed down unforgivingly through the big plate glass untinted window even on cold days.</li>
            <li> Seriously Pinaud, can&#x27;t we have a glass bottle option?</li>
            <li> Can be applied liberally to the skin after a shave and still provide a subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> Some are ridiculously overpriced.  </li>
            <li> There is a soapiness along with the subtle hints of bay oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent of Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum is rather weak.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find these days.  </li>
            <li> It is going to be a tough choice after shaving trying to decide which Clubman to splash on.</li>
            <li> Dominica wasnt bad, but not really my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Even when I shave and have a few cuts this doesn&#x27;t burn too bad to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that, either.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this bay rum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nostalgic smelling aftershave.</li>
            <li> No headache causing, weird, froo-froo department store girly-man smell.</li>
            <li> Oh but that plastic bottle is so lame.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, my wife did not.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s going to burn like mad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nostalgic.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they changed to formula or this was a bad batch</li>
            <li> just terrible.</li>
            <li> my wife thought it smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> this was so terrible....</li>
            <li> none of this means anything to you, might as well just get one of those awful CK fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is the worst smell out there.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has a nice smell, but disappears quickly.  I have had no one comment on it. I will continue to use it, but will try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> My husband buys this and for me it is a total turn on.  Can&#x27;t get enough o this fragrance on a  man!!</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this because of the Bay Rum component, on a whim.  What I discovered is that the aroma is perfectly redolent of spices.  Kind of smells like wine mulling spices, is the best way to put it, with extremely noticeable overtones of cinnamon and allspice.  Not saying it&#x27;s bad, just be ready to smell kind of like a snack.</li>
            <li> The corner of the bottle was crushed</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like someone rubbed you down with clothes. The cologne only lasts for 30 minutes. Not worth the money. Clubman original and clubman reserve are 10x better!</li>
            <li> I first used this years ago and then had trouble finding it in stores-although I did buy other Clubman products.I found this of course on Amazaon and just love it.I think the man in your life would enjoy it as well</li>
            <li> After Shave the way it is supposed to be, strong, stinging, brisk, smells great and works great on toning your face.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the drug store down the street but hey stopped carrying it. It smells nice, is inexpensive and the bottle lasts a long time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it and give to my best friends for Gifts so get some now!    Hollywood Dan</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum is has a classic, masculine and spicey aroma that cools and smells great for a few hours without being overly strong.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  Cheap, chemical smelling, and doesn&#x27;t last.    I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  Put down the Pinaud and try Ogallala.  Ogallala contains natural essential oils, not chemicals.    I also recommend the \\&quot;Special Reserve Double Strength Cologne\\&quot;.  It is my favorite from what Ogallala offers and definitely the best Bay Rum I&#x27;ve ever tried, although the original will suit most people fine.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a more traditional bay rum aftershave I still enjoy the scent. Smells mostly like cinnamon and cloves which I find pleasant and \\&quot;different\\&quot; in an aftershave. As far as the scent goes I find it to be as pleasant as they come and a nice change of pace.    It works well against razor burn, better than any other splash I&#x27;ve tried. Keep in mind that it&#x27;s not a cooling/mentholated aftershave so you won&#x27;t have that cooling sensation some people favor.</li>
            <li> Classic scent, rugged and manly without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> This makes me smell like a cross between an old man and a cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li> The Bay Rum that my Dad used when I was a kid and Virgin Island Bay Rum are two very different scents.  I bought it with the memory of that earlier scent.  It did not fulfill my dreams and has been replaced by a different brand.</li>
            <li> My husband had a bay rum that is no longer being made. I tried to replace it with this. It smells cheap. Bay rum doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good. Replaced it with Dominica.</li>
            <li> this is a great product with an awesome scent. it works good on my razor burn and leaves my face feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. I use razorock first and then the bay rum. What a rush and really completes the whole shave</li>
            <li> Excellent traditional sent. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love Bay Rum aftershave.  Reminds me of the old barber shops and hot moist towels after a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that some guys obviously love this stuff, but here&#x27;s my perspective:    I don&#x27;t wear cologne, and as far as \\&quot;smelling like a man\\&quot; goes I believe there are two general routes.  Light-medium and spicy/stimulating, or extremely strong but more subtle/muted.  This stuff is extremely strong and spicy/stimulating; and I mean strong.  When I first cracked the cap open on this thing I got a huge whiff of it within a second, and that was from a 1 ft away before I&#x27;d even removed the cap.  I later experimented by spreading a small drop over one of my fingers and seeing how long it lasted.  Well it lasted forever and didn&#x27;t die much.  Could smell that tiny drop from 1 ft away easy.  Now granted I apparently have a more sensitive nose then most, but this stuff smells stronger than most detergents.  Can&#x27;t imagine how strong it would be if I splashed this stuff all over my face (or body as the instructions suggest).  Would probably give me a headache.    As for the scent itself, my first thought was \\&quot;old person\\&quot;, my second thought was \\&quot;overcompensating\\&quot;.  \\&quot;Overcompensating old person\\&quot; is not the image I want to project.</li>
            <li> The scent of Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum is rather weak. It does not smell bad but just does not have much of a scent. Now, I do realize it was not meant to be overpowering but I did expect it to have a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> This product is alright. But to me, it smells very simple, mostly just cloves is all I smell. I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh. It has very little lasting power on my skin. I would say it lasts about an hour and then it can no longer be smelled on me. It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice. Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves.</li>
            <li> I bought for my dad for Christmas. Very hard to find in stores. His father always wore it so it was special for him.</li>
            <li> I was looking at an invoice from another internet vendor and going to reorder from them.  As it was I was going for a Super Saver order so added this item.  When I got it, I noticed the label was slightly different because they gave me a different size.  Almost twice as much for a reasonable price.  I would say the smell is classic as my dad was wearing it in the fifties.  Sweet!</li>
            <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. At first this was the least favorite of the Pinaud products. I thought that it did not last, mistaking the scent I would catch later in the day for the Quinine hair tonic. When I stopped using the tonic to just judge this product, I realized the spicy undertone was, in fact, the Bay Rum. I read the reviews saying this was not a real Bay Rum and after trying Captain&#x27;s Choice, I think that is a good thing. I prefer the spicy undertones to the Bay Rum scent. Not sure I would buy this again, but then a few weeks ago I was ready to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful spicy stuff. Burns like gasoline and makes you smell like a Christmas cake, and once the burn fades you feel nice and refreshed. The only thing that would make this nicer is if it had a shot of menthol in it. That would be cool (scuse the pun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not modern, it is strictly old-school. I could picture somebody like Jimmy Cagney, or Humphrey Bogart using something like this. This is not just for old dudes though, I&#x27;m 30 and I use it. It&#x27;s not something I use every day though, just every now and again. The scent is very distinctive, and I could easily see some people loving it and some people absolutely hating it. I think checking it out for yourself is the only way to know which category you&#x27;re in. It&#x27;s not stupidly expensive, so why not give it a try?</li>
            <li> The spicy scent of this product places it on par with much more expensive colognes and after shave lotions.  It is refreshing and unique.  The purchase and delivery was easy and fast</li>
            <li> Good scent and manly.  Well worth the money compared to other bay rum after shaves.  I would buy it again, and will.</li>
            <li> Great bay rum scent! Nice little sting after shaving. Brings me back to our vacation in the Bahamas.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t find Bay Rum locally. He even started making it. So happy to find it online. It was mailed very promptly and I&#x27;ve loved him wearing this on his face and neck since he received it. Great spicy smell, manly and clean.</li>
            <li> Scent is a personal thing, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different Bay Rum aftershaves and this has the most classic smell to my nose.     It&#x27;s also cheap. Despite what another reviewer says, this is not generally thought to be a long-lasting scent. I can&#x27;t detect it a half-hour after application (try Ogallala Special Reserve Cologne for a stronger, longer lasting smell).    Cheap, classic, smells great.</li>
            <li> Half the fun of this aftershave is the cool ship on the label.  When you put this on your face, you will feel like a swashbuckling pirate! Very Spicy Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li> Bay rum reminds me of the good old days when getting a haircut meant climbing into an old \\&quot;Koken\\&quot; barber chair (guaranteed to withstand a nuclear blast) and having your hair trimmed by a man in a white smock who wasn&#x27;t timing you against his next cigarette. The walls were mirrored, and maybe there was a cheesecake calendar on the wall and a pile of centerfolded \\&quot;Esquires\\&quot; on the table in the uncomfortable waiting area where the sun blazed down unforgivingly through the big plate glass untinted window even on cold days. It was a man&#x27;s world of leather strops and towel steamers. The only women were those bringing the little ones for their first haircuts (remember booster seats?) or wives who waited patiently, not hovering over the chair directing the barber on how to do his job. There was nobody pointing to a picture in a magazine saying, \\&quot;Like that!\\&quot; and Miss Clairol wasn&#x27;t hanging provocatively on the wall. The clippers buzzed and hummed, the shears snipped, and the place smelt of barbicide, brush soap and bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah yes, bay rum. The shop&#x27;s only concession to exotica, it put you in mind of faraway places, trade winds, and white sands, a clean smell, an altogether masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though nature decreed me to long since forego haircuts to the extent that shaving my pate is the smartest choice I can make, and even though I have a beard (now white as Father Neptune&#x27;s), I still enjoy splashing on the old bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum is reasonably priced and pleasantly cool and refreshing on the skin. It&#x27;s an old-fashioned scent, now hard to find in your local mass-market drugstores, to young ladies reminiscent perhaps of their kindly old grandfathers, but still, it takes a rare man to buck modernity and give himself back to the classics: Shaving with a mug and brush, smoking a pipe, wearing Wayfarers, and using Bay Rum. This isn&#x27;t just a scent, its a statement of intention.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of this product. The fresh aroma was above my expectation. I would recommend this product to anyone who remembers and enjoyed the old time barber shop.</li>
            <li> As one who enjoys Bay Rum as an aftershave, I have found it hard to find Bay Rum these days especially at a reasonable price.  Finding the Clubman version on Amazon was a pleasant surprise.  It is a good product and seems to me to be as good as the high priced alternatives in the exclusive men&#x27;s stores.</li>
            <li> Has a real nice fragrance leaves my face feeling very good after a good shave,have reccomended to other wet shavers</li>
            <li> I love the smell of bay rum and I am glad to get this.</li>
            <li> smells great plenty for the price. have used it all my life.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive Bay Rums, but find Clubman&#x27;s to be fragrant enough but not cloyingly heavy. Seems to heal razor burn immediately, too.</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance on it. To me, it smells like a Bay Rum should. Spicy, a hint of vanilla, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Feels Amazing on shaved balls.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is kind of like a British/Euro spicy aftershave while Clubman Bay Rum puts a little Irie in it. It is strong with clove and cinnamon but it&#x27;s an awesome AS. Buy it now. This is the way to smell like a man, rather than all these unisex &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; scents these days.</li>
            <li> A simple fragrance long overlooked. Good value strongly recommed the product. A prodict of the good old days. This is for the person that makes their own path.</li>
            <li> Exelent smell, my girlfiend got it for me for a christmas present and wow am i impressed. I use prada, porasso, taylor of old bond street, ect.... this is by far the best scent ive had so far. Highly recommended for both young and old.</li>
            <li> This is an old style scent, which reminds me of a barber shop. It is not long lasting, but is clean and spicy smelling.</li>
            <li> Man, this smells wonderful. I was hesitant to order this Clubman scent, as I love the original. So glad I did order it. The inital reaction once you apply to your face is quite refreshing (by refreshing I mean, WOW, if you have used the original then you already know). The scent is strong at first but mellows out after a few short minutes and lasts ALL DAY! Love this stuff! It is going to be a tough choice after shaving trying to decide which Clubman to splash on.</li>
            <li> Remember those day when the Barber splashed on that after shave that you couldn&#x27;t find in the store. Well this is it ! Great stuff ... Old memories.</li>
            <li> My first journey into Ed Pinaud and I absolutely love it. My only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough!</li>
            <li> I must say this goes on VERY strong.  Lots of spice and rum smell, however if lasts a long time and mellows a little with time.  I do like it!</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE 3</li>
            <li> I bought this after shave because my Barber uses Bay Rum after he shaves the back of my neck and I love the scent. I ordered this brand because I have always used Clubman and loved it, and I still do. However, the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum smells nothing like the classic Bay Rum scent. It smells like some extra spicy almost cinnamon scent. I didnt like it at all. Maybe someone out there might love it, but I didnt, mainly because I had a certain expectation of what it was going to smel like and Clubman didnt deliver. If you want an awsome classic Bay Rum scent go and buy Stephan&#x27;s Bay Rum. That is the same that my barber uses and its the best.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum is kinda hard to describe - but it is good.  It&#x27;s kind of like Old Spice - but less flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are over 17, please skip the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; and the imitators.  Nobody likes to be slapped with a cosmic cloud of reek when you walk by.  (And no, the girls are not magnetically attracted to an AXE cloud...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a few different types/flavors of Bay Rum scents over the years, never finding &amp;#34;the right&amp;#34; scent.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect rendition of what I remember.  Slightly spicy/complex - but not flowery or overpowering.  Downright zingy after a close shave in the morning.  (And I don&#x27;t leave a smelly &amp;#34;backwash trail&amp;#34; as I walk through the cubes at work...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the folks that figured this out.  Classy, strong, manly (not flowery) scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JDMc</li>
            <li> Smells a littler &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; than other bay rum after shaves. However, I really like the scent. It is pleasant and manly while not too strong or too weak. It smells manly and classy It does a good job soothing my face after shaving. I think the price is excellent and the size is more than big enough to last a long while.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after seeing the movie &amp;#34;Scent of a Woman&amp;#34; with Al Pacino. His character in the movie wore Bay Rum cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! when I read the other comments about how it is rely strong and the smell lasts to long i was worried but nope it the stuff wont kill you with overpowering scent and it will last a good hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfume, and Bay Rum is hard to find in my little town.  I love it and my grand daughter likes it-so what can I add.  It&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering, but it&#x27;s not subtle either.  Not for everyone but great for me.</li>
            <li> We were told we could find this produce in Walgreen stores but they didn&#x27;t have it, so I was glad to be able to find it on line.  It has been one my husbands favorites since high school, but hasn&#x27;t been able to find it again until now.  He was  delighted to receive it and is very pleased.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with Bay Rum.  It&#x27;s one of those old school scents that takes you back to a better time.  This is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I kid you not when I say that when the first scent of this stuff hit my nostrils, I smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THIS is what I want to breathe in all day. It&#x27;s not musky, it&#x27;s not fruity, it&#x27;s not metro. It&#x27;s not the weak \\&quot;light spritz\\&quot; most men unfortunately opt for. This is splash on, slap your face, wake the hell up goodness. It smells delicious. And I&#x27;m talking real deal manly delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinaud Bay Rum is complex, warm, woodsy and spicy but not overpowering. I&#x27;ve read other reviews on here that state \\&quot;one drop behind each ear\\&quot;, etc. Are you kidding me? I suppose that will suffice for a few minutes, but if you&#x27;re wanting to smell manly, trustworthy and rugged all day, get a nice generous splash and smack it on your cheeks and neck, and get something to fend off your wife or girlfriend with. She&#x27;ll be attacking in 5....4....3....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whiskey connoisseur I implemented my seasoned olfactory skills to see what this concoction had to offer. Upon first whiff of course you get the standout notes: clove and cinnamon. But after that, there are more subtle varieties that bring out the complexity of the aftershave in tinges of vanilla, pepper, oak, maybe even leather? I could be making the leather up. Just might be the best combination of scents to ever grace my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you that for a few years now, I&#x27;ve been alternating between classic Old Spice (yes I know it&#x27;s not the original recipe so settle down) and Brut. These are both pretty musky and old man-ish, but were good for my budget and did the job. Also, I like the way they smack you in the face after a fresh DE razor shave. It feels extra saucy when you have a few nicks. One of my favorite parts about aftershave is the burn post-shave. Makes me feel alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was hoping the Pinaud would do the same. Dang was I impressed. Not only did my generous splash sting nicely, it left my face in a suprisingly supple condition. I surely did not expect the soft, semi-moisturized feeling of the bay rum. I&#x27;m used to the Old Spice and Brut drying out my face immediately, which I could live with because it felt so good to put on. But with the Pinaud Bay Rum it&#x27;s the best of both worlds. There&#x27;s something in the tonic that goes on super smooth and feels refreshing and healthy for your skin. So I put on a second splash and didn&#x27;t look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased with this stuff...I&#x27;ve tried colognes (including bay rum cologne), balms and other aftershaves, but none compare to this. The Pinaud Bay Rum smells like a combination of Christmas Eve, a lumberyard, a pirate and Grandpa&#x27;s barbershop. Side note: couldn&#x27;t care less about the plastic bottle people are griping about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 satisfied stars. Another generous splash? Don&#x27;t mind if I do.eling of the bay rum.

            <li> This is a great cologne for any time.  It will be one of my favorites from now on.  This Virgin Islands&#x27; blend is a welcome change from the more recent overbearing scents.  This is a man&#x27;s man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I have used this Bay Rum for several years and like it.  It is not as nice smelling as the Royall Bay Rum, but for the price it is good for everyday use.  I wish they would change to a glass bottle because the plastic gives off an unwanted added fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bay rum works good as an after shave or fragrance. It is very hard to find these days.  It used to be the choice of barbers as an after shave.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like cloves and baking spices. Smells intense, but once on the skin I don&#x27;t think it smells nearly as powerful. It is alcohol based so it gives a slight burn. I guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. Even when I shave and have a few cuts this doesn&#x27;t burn too bad to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little cheap, but works fine if you don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li> I was weary about this stuff when I first opened the bottle. My wife wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it either.  She says it smells like I splashed Christmas on my face. It&#x27;s definitely  clove or cinnamon smell. Rather than throw it out I continued to use it and I&#x27;m staring to like it, but I&#x27;m nuts for cinnamon anyways. The bad part is it only lasts at most for 3 hours before you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on.  usually have to splash it on about 3 times a day. I will stick with original clubman aftershave.</li>
            <li> A little strong, but for the price, we can&#x27;t complain. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It smells like an old school barber shop to me. There are a lot of other Bay Rums out there, but this and Col Conks Bay Rum shave soap are the only two Ive found so far that I enjoy. Dominica wasnt bad, but not really my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great thing about Clubman BR (aside from the fact that it makes you smell like a MAN) is that it is really inexpensive. I dont think Ive ever paid double digits for a bottle, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really dont like about it is the packaging. I wish they would put it in a more attractive glass bottle, instead of plastic. I would learn to live with the price hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on pretty strong, and if you just shaved itll burn like napalm when you first put it on. The scent can be a little overpowering at first, but it settles down after a while and becomes more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id recommend it for anyone that cuts hair off their face.</li>
            <li> I am another one of those old school types who prefer the more traditional Old Spice type scents over the \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents of most modern aftershaves and colognes.  I had been unable to find anything I really liked since Old Spice was sold to P. &amp; G. and the formula changed or watered down.  This is the closest I&#x27;ve found to that old time scent I liked and I love it!  The reason for the 4-star rating is because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like, which is a common problem with a lot of modern products like this.</li>
            <li> You know you want to.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but really that just means you need to liberally apply it all over.  Mind the burn, its good for you.</li>
            <li> just did not have the staying power as it hA IN THE Pat.  However it is still among the best on the maeket.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad he loves the bay rum sent he used to get the original in the islands this is the closest I can find to the original</li>
            <li> Boy this smells great. I love this you must try it out ...my wife likes it and co-workers ask me about too !!!😃&lt;br /&gt;WRC</li>
            <li> I am convinced that in the movie &amp;#34;The Exorcist&amp;#34;, the 2 priests performing the exorcism were not throwing Holy water on the young possessed girl; rather, they were throwing Clubman Bay Rum on her. &amp;#34;Nooooo! Noooooo!!!! It burns!!!! It burns!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the facts....no matter how well your shave went, this stuff will kick you in the face once it is applied. It&#x27;s going to burn like mad and it&#x27;s not pleasant at first, but after a couple of minutes there is a very comfortable warming effect. The scent is more of cloves and cinnamon, but it is a wonderful scent that lasts the whole day...yet it&#x27;s not overpowering. You&#x27;ll get compliments from this one. It&#x27;s a clean, fresh-shaved, adult scent. Nothing wrong with that, either. This one also makes your skin feel great all day.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  This has a great scent that is not overpowering.  I have been wearing it for a few days now.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! I use this as an aftershave every morning. I just wish the scent would last a bit longder througout the day.</li>
            <li> I never could get use to the smell. almost skunkish at first with cinnamon scent added to it. just terrible.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this bay rum. The bottle was cheap plastic, and felt like it would fall apart upon arrival. The smell is very chemical and perfumy. I was not impressed because I smelled more chemicals than I did natural oils or bay leaves. If you&#x27;re looking for something like Burt&#x27;s Bees (discontinued) this is not it.</li>
            <li> This is a low cost good smelling bay rum, its not ST.Johns but its a very good alternative two more words</li>
            <li> This is great stuff lasts a long time, smells like classic Bay Rum should, inexpencive and lasts. Will purchace more through Amazon !!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a straight razor and DE razor for the last five years. However, lately I have really gotten more into it and was looking for an aftershave to complete the nostalgic barbershop shave experience. The Clubman Virgin Islands Bay Rum was just what I was looking for. This product is straight up old fashion barbershop aftershave. Even though it is something your father or grandfather might have used younger men like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given straight razor shaves to a couple of my mid twenties friends and finished up with the bay rum and they thought it was great. My wife liked the smell also. I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, barbershop smell. I reduced one star mainly because the clove fragrance is a bit too strong. I will have to figure out how to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> This is one of the classics! If you like a more traditional bay rum, heavy on the clove and light on the rum, this ones for you. Good burn too. I have lots of artisan after shaves and this is still one of my top 5!</li>
            <li> Great bay rum scent and classic sting upon application. Will tighten up your pores while healing razor burn. Scent isn&#x27;t too strong but does linger for a bit after application.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great on the skin, feel a nice cooling tingle on your face</li>
            <li> Harsh stuff, drys your skin out in a flash and the burn feels like a chemical accident. Go elsewhere for Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> I really do love the smell of this stuff once I got used to it. It does smell better when you let it air out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it lasted longer though. Seems I can only smell it for a few mins and end up over doing it to get the smell to last.&lt;br /&gt;Wetting the face and head throughout the day brings it back though.&lt;br /&gt;I love it for the price</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, burns like atomic fire balls in a good way, wakes me up in the morning and smells great</li>
            <li> Light Bay Rum scent. Lingers for short time.  Gives a good tingle but you can stand it. Tightens pores. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the old barber shop where I used to get my hair cut when I was a child. The barber would always slap a little Bay Rum on the back of my neck after cutting my hair. It&#x27;s a unique fragrance that&#x27;s a nice change from your every day colognes and after shaves. The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this for my fiancé. I purchased a large sample pack containg all of Pinaud&#x27;s scents after rediscovering the original Clubman. This is a very spicy scent, cinnamon and clove mainly and out of all of Pinaud&#x27;s offerings this is the one that she came back after my shave and asked what I was wearing today. The scent will stay with you through most of the day though don&#x27;t expect anyone to really smell it several hours later unless they are extremely close. It is heavy on the alcohol burn which I tend to enjoy after a close shave. Yes it comes in a plastic bottle and yes it is cheap. Value wise I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and as an aftershave I call it good. (My vote is still with the original)</li>
            <li> I put this on, and my son said &amp;#34;smells like buggers mixed with horse poop, with throwup once you eat it.&amp;#34;  I give it two stars because it is not quite that bad, but does not smell suitable for a human face to me.  It&#x27;s more like a stale bag of cinammony potpourri.</li>
            <li> Spicy, manly, and pairs well with any number of citrus scents if you want to cut the sweetness.  A great, unobtrusive scent, that stands strongly apart from the overpowering omnipresence of Axe, Polo, etc.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell but it last about thirty minutes really not worth the money unless you use a bottle a day</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum is incredible, it serves for a common cold, pains, massages, it is the greatest....thank ou so much, you&#x27;ve made my day.</li>
            <li> Clubman always make a fine product. I love the Bay Rum scent. It seems to stay with you quite awhile and isn&#x27;t over-powering, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;A great scent of the man who wants to smell like a man of the 50-60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I use a more expensive brand and bought this to try - I was well satisfied and use it for my every day after shave.</li>
            <li> I use the classic Clubman and thought I&#x27;d try the Bay Rum scent.  I like it.  Other favorites include Jockey Club (Caswell Massey).</li>
            <li> Someone said this aftershave smells like Christmas. Take that with absolute seriousness, because they were right. I feel like festive cookies were cooking in the oven when I used this. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t actually like smelling that every time I shave. It&#x27;s just too much. I wish I got Lime Sec.</li>
            <li> I love this oldie but goodie , reminds me of Santa at the beach after Christmas , very nutmeggy (( is that a word )) with cinnamon and warm vanilla cookies ! Goes on strong but blends well !! Never overpowering!!! Love this brand and all the colognes in it !!!&lt;br /&gt;Not for the hipsters</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a straight razor and figured I might as well get an appropriate aftershave. This stuff smells great! It&#x27;s very nostalgic. It&#x27;s definitely worlds apart from Axe, Tag, and other janky &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; that my generation uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, however.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for months. It&#x27;s the best after-shave I have found. My wife loves the scent!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this scent.  Have used it before so was happy to find a place to order it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the cinnamony smell.  I thought it would be better. Have to do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li> Smells OK, but not great. There&#x27;s way too much cinnamon in the mix that completely overpowers the rest of the fragrance, it just smells like I&#x27;m putting on cinnamon oil. The bottle is cheap plastic, I expected glass from the picture and the cost. Despite the name, there&#x27;s no rum in it. The sweet smell comes from benzene which is carcinogenic. Disappointed after ordering it I found the same brand and bottle at my local chain drug store for less than half of what I paid. I probably won&#x27;t reorder this type.</li>
            <li> I have loved the smell of bay rum since I was a kid.  just smells masculine, no need to overcompensate.  A great product at an amazing price point.</li>
            <li> The scent of a bygone era returns! A resurgence in D.E. shaving has also brought out the companions of old to authenticate the experience. Give it a try...</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and this particular Bay Rum, is great. It&#x27;s not as pungent as other brands. In fact, it has a clean scent similar to that found in high-end colognes. Remember, as with most traditional colognes, a drop just below each ear is all you need.</li>
            <li> This may make you smell like an old man, but it will make you smell like an old man that has to beat away the hordes of tail it&#x27;s aroma attracts.  Thank you, Clubman!</li>
            <li> I love Clubman Pinaud but not this smell</li>
            <li> Outstanding scent.  I can&#x27;t wait to splash it on each morning.  Not too overpowering, but when you put it on, you feel like a pirate.  Then it&#x27;s off to work in the real world.</li>
            <li> The Bay Rum has a nice barbershop aroma that is spicy, and my wife claims the aroma smells of log cabins, fly poles, and a bearskin rug lying by a fire.</li>
            <li> A little high on the alcohol side, the scent is nice and not overpowering. Scent lasts maybe 2-3 hours which is just enough. Bay Rum smells like a sweet dark rum.</li>
            <li> This is my first Bay Rum purchase.  I am very pleased with it.  The only downside is the plastic bottle but considering the price what should you expect?  My wife really likes the smell and she would be the first to tell me otherwise.  It may fade a little quick, but that beats &amp;#34;overwhelming&amp;#34; hands down.  Good stuff.  I may check out others but I would most definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Bay Rum it was probably on a discount table so I was not surprised I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except Amazon.  I dont know if they changed to formula or this was a bad batch but the scent was mild and indistinct.  The bottle fell off the shelf yesterday breaking open and spilling half of it on the floor. My house does not smell like bay rum now, for me that answers any questions about this variety of clubman bay rum. I&#x27;m going to keep looking until I find the real deal.</li>
            <li> The aftershave provides a superb cooling effect to the skin upon shaving.  The reason I gave it only the stars because it smells like gloves instead of rum</li>
            <li> I love this after shave  bay rum ...............  Its cheap and it feels  great !!</li>
            <li> I remember this scent from my earliest barbershop recollections.  It feels nice after the save and has a lingering scent that is not over-powering.  There is strong \\&quot;tingle on the skin when first splashed on the face from the alcohol in the product.  I will purchase the product again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes you smell like a man. This is not for some urban wimp. It burns and soothes at the same time after a good hot shave. I have tried other kinds of Bay Rum but always come back to Pinaud.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it, and so do I, great price</li>
            <li> Clubman Virgin Island smells synthetic to me. It&#x27;s clove heavy with some musk and chemicals and doesn&#x27;t resemble any other bay rum I&#x27;ve tried. I prefer the scents of Dominica, Krampert&#x27;s, Captain&#x27;s Choice, Layrite, Ogallala, and even Superior 40 over this. If you do like this, it has an advantage over the other Bay Rum&#x27;s I&#x27;ve mentioned, it last much longer. Also, its cheaper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I was expecting, though it&#x27;s OK.  The clove smell is more dominant than in the bay rum I&#x27;d had before (St Johns Bay Rum®), where I could also smell lime, and the overall scent isn&#x27;t quite the same.  It fades pretty quickly.  Not bad for the price, considering that I didn&#x27;t want to spend $45 for 4 oz., and it&#x27;s my fall-back if I don&#x27;t want to use up the Guerlain Vetiver cologne I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t digging the scent. Other people seem to love it, though.</li>
            <li> This is one of my biggest favorite after shaves. It has a nice, sharp spicy aroma, but not too strong. It&#x27;s what I think of when I mean a classic barbershop scent.</li>
            <li> Just what I remembered from years ago.  Subtle yet masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells (manly, but not old) and the way it tingles after shaving.  I&#x27;ve had this nearly a year and still have a good third left in the bottle.  I&#x27;m definitely purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I had to try this because of the great reviewers. It&#x27;s a nostalgic smelling aftershave. I have never smelt this before so it doesn&#x27;t hold any feelings for me. It just has a particular odor. It&#x27;s ok, I use it. It&#x27;s just simply an aftershave with a distinct aroma. Can&#x27;t say I think it&#x27;s grandeous or anything. Just ok. Doesn&#x27;t last for a long time but it&#x27;s strong at first. At least it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I&#x27;ve several comments on how good I smell!  I would recommend it to any friend.  Refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> Item came on time.  Too spicy for me, so I gave it to a friend.  My friend liked it just fine.  Be advised that this is a spicy sent.  If that is what you like, then buy it.</li>
            <li> ...evokes fond memories of being a young boy sitting cross-legged on the bathroom counter and intently watching my grandfather&#x27;s every move as he methodically went through the machinations of his daily early morning wet-shave ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time when he was done carefully shaving and then cleaning the straight razor, along with the lathering cup and brush, he would look at himself in the mirror while stroking his cheeks to check for any missed spots while reaching for the clear glass bottle of Ed Pinaud&#x27;s CLUBMAN VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM Aftershave Splash and proceed to douse his face, neck and chest with a couple of healthy handfuls of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his hands still dripping of this beautifully spicy and exotic, bay tree filled far-away-tropical-paradise smelling after shave, he would then rub my cheeks, the top of my ears and head with the excess and I would smell just like grandpa&#x27;s aftershave all day long...and I absolutely loved it. I reveled in it then and deeply cherish the memory today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my shear delight when I recently came across this classic product...I purchased the larger 12oz size bottle, which looks almost exactly like the bottle from almost 50 years ago except it&#x27;s now a shatter-proof plastic instead of the thicker glass bottle it used to be packaged in. Ok, I can live with that, being more safety-conscious in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real test was what was inside that bottle...did it look the same with that light brown yet rich looking brown color?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES...the color and overall look is exactly the same as I remember it from almost 50 years ago. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it feel the same with its silky smooth texture along with its unique soothing, cooling and refreshing tingle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALMOST...it seems to be lighter-bodied now with hardly any cooling sensation, though it is still quite soothing and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, did it smell the same with it&#x27;s heady exotically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of cinnamon oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, NO...it did NOT. It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...its now WAY too clove-heavy with very little essence of bay tree and virtually zero cinnamon oil emanating from today&#x27;s formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.otically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of cinnamon oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, NO...it did NOT.

            <li> Reminds me of going to the barber shop with my dad.and the feeling I would have when the barber finished,.</li>
            <li> This has a manly smell.  Makes one think of the old barber shops where men were shaved with the straight razors.  Pinaud is an old, reliable company that makes good products with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I smell like a mixture of an old barber shop and possibly the Virgin Islands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been there so I am not 100% sure. But I don&#x27;t stink so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> Not to strong a smell and not to light. Just right and feels great after I shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Also...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the few after shaves that no matter how much I use or where I use it, I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> What can I say. The wife loves it. I love it. Life is good!!! The scent when you first put it on reminds you a little of atomic fireballs but then it mellows out into a nice spicy scent. This is definitely my go to cologne.</li>
            <li> .....................having burnt melted cinnamon &#x27;red hots&#x27; in your pocket on a hot summer day, and then reaching for your keys only to get that smell all over you.  And you know what?  That smells pretty darn good!  Who would&#x27;ve known?!</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of licorice or anise. If you like those type of scents then you might like this product... I do not.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be another version of the regular Pinaud aftershave.  Instead, it&#x27;s a VERY different scent.  It smells like orange wassle.  I mean, exactly like orange wassle.  Don&#x27;t know what orange wassle is?  Umm, it&#x27;s a hot Christmas drink made of oranges and cinnamon (and maybe some other stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soo, if you want to smell like a Christmas drink that nobody likes, this is the scent for you!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I use it as more of a body splash and refresher.  Works great as a REAL manly cologn; simple, spicy, and effective.  No headache causing, weird, froo-froo department store girly-man smell. After a heavy workout I&#x27;ll splash some of this on my chest, arms, and hair and BAM!  Fresh and manly for the rest of my errands before going home.  I know the stuff works because I&#x27;ve had more women interested in me since I started using it! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna smell fresh, spicy and manly for the ladies?  This is the stuff for you!</li>
            <li> I thought it was an excellant after shave- feels great- nice smell- and doesn&#x27;t over power you.  But for you single guys out there- my wife thought it smelled terrible.  Being an old guy- who cares!  LOL- anyway I will keep it in my rotation- though I like Original Clubman much better!  So does my wife!</li>
            <li> I generously sprinkle this over myself after a shower. It leaves me smelling exotic, spicy and just darn good. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all, but it&#x27;s got enough of a kick for others to smell (and certainly appreciate!). Will not be leaving the house again without putting some of this on. My girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it, she&#x27;s in disbelief that a man can smell so good ;)</li>
            <li> this was so terrible....my hubby used it ONCE and vetoed it immediately.  i dared him to take it to work and leave it in the men&#x27;s room and watch how fast it was used up - about 1/2 way gone and stayed that way.  speaks for itself....</li>
            <li> The scent of Clubman Bay Rum is outstanding. It&#x27;s a little cinnamon heavy upon application, but it wears off a bit and balances out quickly.</li>
            <li> Classic smell and feels good on my face after shaving.  Who needs the fancy, overpriced stuff when you can get the barbershop smell at home.</li>
            <li> Wussies need not apply. But real men (and their real women) love this stuff. Refreshing, classic scent with that alcohol wake-up call that says to your skin &amp;#34;it&#x27;s morning OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES&amp;#34;. As a bonus, it will make you want to smoke a pipe, drink whiskey and take up deep sea fishing.  Oh but that plastic bottle is so lame. Seriously Pinaud, can&#x27;t we have a glass bottle option? I&#x27;d pay a buck or two more for &amp;#34;Bay Rum Premium now in glass bottle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love to smell it on my husband&#x27;s face all day long.  It is a good product which I could not find here in town.</li>
            <li> Great smell bought it for my husband, he loves it and so do I :)  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Aftershave is supposed to smell clean, refreshing and invigorating. Having used Pinaud&#x27;s original&lt;br /&gt;aftershave, I thought I&#x27;d try this Bay Rum.  Totally smells like skunk.  If I were to describe it, it smells&lt;br /&gt;like some cheap cologne that you&#x27;d buy at the supermarket.  Stick to the original Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li> This bottle is much better than some other bay rum that we have purchased, the glass bottles are heavy and the stoppers are awkward...this one is great!</li>
            <li> Has a great scent, only lasts about one hour.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the third bottle Ive ordered.  My daughter likes it on me.  Wished it lasted a little longer, but it has more staying power than the competition.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I must say sometimes you get much more than you pay for. I have yet to find a scent that is as refreshing or more compliment inducing than this one. Mind you, this as field tested against my colognes that sell for $50+. Next, this is the only aftershave I have found that keeps me entirely razor burn free. Use a little before you shave to kill any bacteria, etc. on your face and a little after. It works wonders.</li>
            <li> Cheap after shave, good price, great smell, short lasting (you get what you pay for). I like it. I like it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very heavy on spice/clove notes. I like to think it makes me smell like a suave yet rugged pirate when carousing with the ladies and swilling rum while in port. My wife hates it, but I don&#x27;t always care. Slap it on and shout your best &amp;#34;yarr, matey.&amp;#34; Just make sure nobody&#x27;s watching.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in record time.  I&#x27;ve used it before and this was the easiest way to order.  This is hard to find locally and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> In contrast to those who criticize this as not smelling like the old stuff, it seems genuine to me.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this in winter, mixed with 50% Masters Bay Rum. Has the barbershop smell. Detectable all day by the Scent Police.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like bay rum, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant</li>
            <li> I have been buying bay rum for years, this brand is superior to any I have I have ever found.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent , not overpowering , not expensive . It smells like a old barber shop , feels great first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> What a great scent. As others have pointed out, it smells of cloves and gingerbread. The scent lasts a good 3-4 hours as an aftershave should and will tone my face nicely after a DE razor shave or a straight razor. It comes in a plastic bottle to keep costs down but looks nice amongst my other aftershaves. The only other cheap bay rum I would use is from Masters as its only $8 and has moisturizer in it. Overall a great scent that can be used for any occasion and I personally love the smell of.</li>
            <li> 1st Bay Rum I have ever tried, and I love it.  I find this to be a great scent for a 25 year old male.  The sweet and spicy is something that I have fallen in love with in this product.  I could practically bathe in it.</li>
            <li> SO strong that I am using it on my boat as a deodorant but not for use on your face.</li>
            <li> I keep buying it herew</li>
            <li> I had to try this stuff...  I&#x27;ve been wanting a good Bay Rum aftershave for a long time.  I finally decided to &amp;#34;throw the money away&amp;#34; and try it - expecting to just eat the loss if I didn&#x27;t like it.  Well, the result is good and bad.  I love the smell - but it&#x27;s a bit strong - you know, like when you go to the airport in Las Vegas and wind up sitting next to the guy from some mega-city who believes, as do all the people with whom he associates, that more aftershave is better?  And then you end up smelling that scent for three hours after your plane lands and you&#x27;re off to your hotel or wherever?  That&#x27;s how this stuff is.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for function, it works very well - will light your face on fire and tighten the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it Bay Rum?  Yes.  Is it old-school?  Yes.  Is it the best Bay Rum product on the market?  Probably not.  I will not be purchasing this product again, though I am glad I tried it.  Some folks absolutely swear by this stuff.  I&#x27;m at a loss as to why.  If you like sexy, subdued scents, seek another product.</li>
            <li> Great Bay Rum fragrant smell . I have been using Clubman Pinaud after-shave and powder for years. This is another fine fine product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this has the proper fragrance, as my tried and true favorite, Caswell-Massy&#x27;s Michelson Bay Rum, seems to have died the death of so many of Caswell-Massey&#x27;s old prduct line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be without Bay Rum. Mixed with witch hazel and some other secret ingredients, it makes a superb, and gentle aftershave lotion. I&#x27;ve only found one or two better. Lucky Tiger after shave is great. But Bay Rum has a distinctive, old fashioned aroma that calls to mind Key West, Hemingway, Cuba, mojitos, swimming in \\&quot;Stingray City,\\&quot; warm nights dancing in a Puerto Rican discotheque, snapper and fried plaintains, and listening to a hundred coquis singing in the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also mean going to the Main St. barber shop and nervously getting into the steel and leather chair as all the older, grown men chuckle and rib you about \\&quot;when you&#x27;re grown,\\&quot; then go on talking sports or politics or that blonde sauntering by the window. That smell might remind you of grizzled, career barbers who could clipper cut your head with only one eye open, shave your neck, then smack a little this on your to make you feel not quite so young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If none of this means anything to you, might as well just get one of those awful CK fragrances. Many of the expensive, department store colognes smell like a stew of confused smells, anyway. Bay Rum comes from a presumably simpler, but no more innocent time. Things weren&#x27;t better then, but the memories you have of them mean the world to you. Bay Rum might transport you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and get an old Pan paperback copy of LIVE AND LET DIE and transport yourself to another time, another place.</li>
            <li> Great any time of year. Took a hint I read online and mix it 50/50 with witch hazel.  Can be applied liberally to the skin after a shave and still provide a subtle scent.  Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing aftershave that I recommend every guy try at least once. I am astounded at how well it tones my face after shaving with my straight razors. Also helps eliminate razor burn. Great stuff! Only complaint is the smell doesn&#x27;t last past an hour.</li>
            <li> NOT A COMPLETE LET DOWN BUT I DID NOT WRITTE TO TELL MOM ABOUT IT EITHER.  WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO MY ENEMIES.</li>
            <li> I started using Bay Rum after my father and mother were divorced when I was 13 and had been shaving awhile. Once the Old Spice Dad left behind ran out, I bought a bottle of Bay Rum at a drug store (where, at the time, it was sold next to Witch Hazel...) and always liked it--especially given the kind of gunk I&#x27;d get (in bulk) for birthdays, Christmas and for some reason, Easter. Anyway, I eventually went to Aqua Velva (long, TMI story there) and in the interim, they quit selling the Bay Rum I liked. Years later, I saw this in a CVS and bought a bottle and the Current Officeholder (AKA \\&quot;Wife #2\\&quot;) loves the stuff and allows no other. (Given the CO is of a high caliber in general, I am loathe to decline.) Of course, as everything, they seem to have quit selling the stuff locally, so I get it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clubman product smells like my Bay Rum of yore, lasts well, is loaded with alcohol, so it cools (or ablates) your skin after a nice, close, shave. I really like to use it when it&#x27;s hot and muggy out, seems to take the Homeless-For-A-Month feeling away on those days. Not to mention the price is right, too. \\&quot;So why only four stars..?\\&quot;, you ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE OF THE +*%-^@*% CHEAP PLASTIC BOTTLE IT COMES IN, THAT&#x27;S WHY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah.. that&#x27;s better. Yes folks, this superb lotion comes in a cheap plastic bottle that nearly always cracks, either in shipment, or the first time you pack it on a suitcase, soaking your nice ties in Bay Rum with a formulation perfectly suited for turning that Brooks Brothers masterpiece into a Jerry Garcia Wannabe knockoff. Rrrrrgh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, find a place to buy it locally, then store it on a cat pillow. OR, buy it here then get a syringe with a large-gauge needle. Find a glass bottle of Eau de Skunque at the Dollar Store, pour it out, rinse with alcohol and decant your precious Bay Rum into that as soon as it arrives from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bug the Amazon customer service folks with whines about cracked Bay Rum bottles; they&#x27;ve already heard it and if they replace it, it&#x27;ll be cracked again, anyway. They wrap it in Saran Wrap pretty well, so unless you have an unemployed place-kicker working at your local UPS hub, the odds are there&#x27;ll be enough to decant for at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, the Clubman brand IS pretty darn good. Dammit.  :)</li>
            <li> This splash on smells great.  It&#x27;s a light and easy fragrace. My honey uses it and I love it.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle the bay rum is strong! I haven&#x27;t worn it enough yet to see the effects after a long day. I guess the initial shock has scared me off for a bit. Still using clubman instead.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and masculine...I love the scent of cloves which Virgin Island Bay Rum has.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to step out and try something different, even though it comes from times past, your find a zing to your night out!</li>
            <li> You could smell the bayrum as soon as the box was open as it was wet from the bottle cracking and spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li> OHHHHHH PINAUD .Where would The World be without you.Oh Pinaud.Your Masculine Spicy almost Cinnamon , yet woodsy and Manly. This is an Out Doors man Scent.It is Spicy and Sweet. Very Nice.Not Subtle at all.Winds down after 15 minutes to a Nice smooth scent. Not to disappoint.I have Used all Colonge&#x27;s from 180.00 to 4.00 . This is a Man&#x27;s Cologne.</li>
            <li> Great manly scent &amp; very reasonably priced. I love it.</li>
            <li> Got a nice Bay Rum with essential oils smell to it. I&#x27;m an Old Spice guy, but I find this to be pleasing and my wife loves it. Was packed in a box with one of those air bag things. Not particularly well packed, but the bottle did not break or crack so no problems there. Price can&#x27;t be beat. I live in Florida, so it goes well with my beach attitude. Will be using this from now on. Unlike Old Spice which fades out completely, this has a residual smell you will like.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of spiced gum drops. While it&#x27;s not normally my preference, it is a nice, clean sent, definitely of a by-gone age (and that&#x27;s a good thing). It was pleasantly surprised that the smell lasts most of the work day.</li>
            <li> I love Pinaud products!&lt;br /&gt;I am into all things barbershop and shaving but thinking I may just not be a bay rum kinda guy. I find anything with a spice sent is not to my liking from spice colognes to a spice sent candle. I think I just cannot get over the spice tones and much prefer the Pinaud Citrus Musk or Osage Rub but thinking it is just me. For the inexpensive price of the Pinaud products I say try them all and do try the Bay Rum if you like a spice tone.</li>
            <li> Real Bay Rum, great burn after a shave, manly men will like this.......</li>
            <li> I love all of Clubman products but this one is nasty. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It is the worst smell out there. My dog even ran from it. Stay away</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance that perks me up and best of all----my wife LOVES it.  She says I&#x27;m very special and loves to be close to me, sometimes without even realizing that I&#x27;m using a great, manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not the aftershave for the metrosexual guy. This is a mans man aftershave. Splash it on feel the burn and love the smell the rest of the day. My wife at first equated the smell to christmas and gingerbread men. This is due to its strong spicy note. But this will fade as the day wears on and turn to a more subtle spice smell. My wife now loves it and insists I use after every shave.</li>
            <li> This is among my favorite aftershaves. The smell is a warm combination of clove and cinnamon. There is a strong but not altogether unpleasant burning when it is applied just after shaving. I have only two minor complaints about this otherwise excellent product: 1. The scent is rather short lived. It all but vanishes after about 2 hours when I apply it. 2. It leaves a slight film on my face. This is  not apparent with each application, but is sometimes slightly uncomfortable. On the whole, This is an excellent, inexpensive aftershave with a classic masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for years, and I love it! Scent is subjective, but to me Bay Rum is musky and spicy, and can be light to the casual sniffer, or more deep and complex when that special someone comes in close. This is not a cologne however, this is an aftershave, and as such, it will never overpower the vehicle in the carpool or choke people out on the elevator. Quite to the contrary it simply says &amp;#34;Yeah that smell is me. It&#x27;s kinda nice, isn&#x27;t it?&amp;#34; Be aware it is alcohol based so it will sting like the dickens if you nicked yourself while shaving. It may seem a tad bit pricey, but one bottle lasts a good long time provided you&#x27;re not too liberal with it. This is sold in my area at drug stores in the shaving supplies area, so if you&#x27;re on the fence, see if you can find it and give it a whiff.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of the original classic Clubman Pinaud, but I wanted to try something new for the customers. Upon receiving the product, I was so anxious to get a smell. It smells amazing, light, clovey and cinnamony. I like it more than the original CP. It however does not contain any oil from the Bay Tree, but for $8, one can&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave if you enjoy clove in your bay rum, which I definitely do! It&#x27;s a powerful scent right when you apply it, but it mellows out within seconds leaving a subtle scent that lingers for a couple hours. This is office friendly, no one else will be able to smell it unless they get super close. All in all another  great aftershave from Clubman!</li>
            <li> This review will hopefully help those who have never smelled Bay Rum before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave quite often, but am only used to the scent of original Old Spice, musk, and other old scents like these. ran out of aftershave recently and decided to branch out for the same old same old. This scent actually does smell a little bit like rum, however I noticed that the scent also smelled like Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know the scent, just go to your local walmart and buy some mulling spices and add it to some Captain Morgans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, my wife inquired whether I had just sprayed the Christmas spray in the bathroom, because the smell was sweet, full of cloves, cinnamon, and a touch of rum. Although the smell was fantastic, I do not believe the smell is for me. In fact, my wife wondered whether the smell was even for men. I&#x27;m not sure about other men, but to me (and my wife, apparently) masculinity doesn&#x27;t smell like cloves and cinnamon. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about my wife, or anyone, asking me why I smell like a cinnamon roll every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you pick up on the key word here? Cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product definitely works. The feeling of alcohol on the face is a nice way to wake up in the morning. But overall, I don&#x27;t think this scent is for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever had this put on me was at Anthony&#x27;s Barbershop in Sacramento CA. I won&#x27;t lie, I smelled so good I wanted to go home with myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product was once common in most drug stores but no more. I like the scent and the value per ounce cannot be beaten. I&#x27;m a guy. I shave with a double edge razor. I don&#x27;t need or want something that is made by designers and metered out like liquid gold and sold to people with those 3 day old beards. Why do they need after shave anyway?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very strongly on most &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; I buy. They either work or don&#x27;t. But I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will not use anything else. My local drugstore stopped cartrying it and I go to great lengths to find it. I recently bought it in bulk, just to make sure I always have some on hand for daily use. As a side note - the ladies seem to like it too.</li>
            <li> Has that typical burn to it after a fresh shave, but does smell good (if a little strong). Definitely was worth buying and was happy with the product, but with the smell being so strong, it seemed more of a odor than a refreshing after shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try it in comparison to [[ASIN:B008LDKIXM Suavecito Bay Rum After Bath 4 oz]], which I got from my barbershop.  I really liked the fresh feeling of the Suavecito after my morning shave, but was looking for something that lasted a little bit longer with regards to the scent.  After some research, I found the Pinaud Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I are sensitive to perfumes.  That made me very cautious of the Pinuad brand to start based on the reviews, but I figured I would give it a try.  I am not in the market for a cologne due to my sensitivity to the perfumes.  I just want a fresh aftershave with a mild scent that can last most of the day...if possible.  After trying out the Pinaud I can now report that it is too strong for my wife and I.  I would categorize this more as a cologne than an aftershave (if there is a difference?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle the perfumes and are in the market for a day long cologne/aftershave, then this product will probably work for you.  If you are similar to me and have a sensitivity to perfumes, give the Suavecito a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find the components of this product online, but could not locate them anywhere.  Here are the inIgredients of both products from their labels (in listed order) in case you are interested:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000053L6W Clubman Pinaud Virgin Island Bay Rum, 12 Ounce]] (This product):&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Denat&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Butylphenyl Methylpropional&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamal Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Citral&lt;br /&gt;Coumarin&lt;br /&gt;Eugerol&lt;br /&gt;Geraniol&lt;br /&gt;Hexyl Cinnamal&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxycitronellal&lt;br /&gt;Isoeugenol&lt;br /&gt;Lemonene&lt;br /&gt;Linalool&lt;br /&gt;Blue 1 (CI 42090)&lt;br /&gt;Red 4 (CI 14700&lt;br /&gt;Yellow 5(CI 19140)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008LDKIXM Suavecito Bay Rum After Bath 4 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;SD Alcohol 40&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Sucrose&lt;br /&gt;Octacetate&lt;br /&gt;Bay Oil&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C Yellow #5</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the original Pinaud Clubman After Shave Lotion as well as other Clubman Pinaud products, I decided to add a bottle of their Bay Rum to my shaving repertoire.  The scent is unique -- one which I really liked.  Unfortunately for me, my wife did not.  Her favorite is still the vanilla, followed closely by the original.  That being said, I would recommend you try this product.  The price is very affordable and if for some reason you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you won&#x27;t be out a fortune for having tried it.  And if you do discover that you like it, all the better.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try this.  I did not know what to expect. It has a hint of cinnamon and very refreshing and not overpowering.  Delivery was quick at great price.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this ! it gives a nice fresh feeling on your face, it isn&#x27;t over powering and stays with you most of the day.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave on the market. Natural &amp; refreshing</li>
            <li> Bought anew, see other reviews. It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> As a child, my parents would take me to a barber shop that utilized this line of product and often, after my haircut and a &amp;#34;pretend&amp;#34; shave, the barber would splash some Virgin Island Bay Rum on me, creating an olfactory memory I never forgot.  I encountered the product again on a recent visit to a golf club in the Caribbean sparking old memories and leading me to order a bottle online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a scent I easily remember with a splash on &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that is refreshing after a close shave.  The odor is a little more cloying than I remember and seems to hang on far longer than most after shave lotions.  It is cool and bracing when splashed on and is somewhat &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; in the simplicity of its spicy island odor as opposed to the emergence of modern laboratory inspired floral concoctions.  I doubt this will become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; after shave, but it is more than adequate and, for me, possesses a huge nostalgic attraction.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The scent is unique in this day and age.  The woman loves it as well.  I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 6 ounce size (177 ml).  I liked it so much that I ordered a twelve ounce (355 ml) bottle a week later.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like bay and allspice and nutmeg and a hint of gingerbread.  At this price, I&#x27;m done trying different bay rum brands.  Some are ridiculously overpriced.  This one is nice, but it fades enough after four hours to need a few more drops.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, like so many aftershaves it only lasts an hour or so, but what an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose we men tend to overdo cologne and this product tempers this tendency.  My wife says she can smell it all day on me.  Hmppf what a gyp that I cant.  Anyway, I highly recommend this fine old world type product.  I supose I miss the glass bottle it used to come in, but it is a great value for the price and shipping costs being what they are.  I can live with the plastic reminder bottle of its original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always taken back to the days the barber would put a board across the seat in the barber shop and pick me up when I was 6 years old and shave the back of my neck a tiny bit and splash this by the handful on me.  I felt positively grown up; yes I did.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a female yet that likes it. Everyone says you smell like an old crusty alcoholic.  Did use the remainder of the bottle to start fires in my wood stove which is why I gave it at least a 1 star.</li>
            <li> Serviceable daily bay rum.  Not outstanding or long lasting.  Not bad, but not exceptional, either.  Still, for the price it is better than most.</li>
            <li> This concoction is a murky mess of synthetic ingredients of dubious quality.  The artificial coloring makes it pour with a hue of blue when it leaves the bottle.  Initial notes are reminiscent of cheap stocking-stuffer colognes that I remember as a kid, blended with Glade plugin and potpourri.  It just doesn&#x27;t mesh with me.  I don&#x27;t mind cinnamon or clove, but something here just seems out of place.  There is a soapiness along with the subtle hints of bay oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this (and the Pinaud / Clubman brand) has a large following, but I&#x27;ve just never found a product from them that I like.  If I were to suggest a bay rum, Dominica with Lime would be my first choice.  It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks for the improved quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am partial to \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; fragrance but this one simply is not it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find bay rum in local stores.  I am 86 and I have looked for bay rum for years.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Pinaud&#x27;s is great.  I use it on my scalp, face, back, etc., and enjoy the fragrance and tingly feel that it leaves.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is overpowering!  I have used Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman after shave lotion in the past and it has a very strong scent; this Bay Rum smells like it is 50% Clubman - not at all the subtle scent I expect from a Bay Rum.  I was very happy in the past with St. John&#x27;s Virgin Islands Bay Rum but the price has gone up way beyond what I am willing to pay.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on this bay rum, wasn&#x27;t sure about trying, however, purchased it so I could make up my own mind. This product is great. I love the cinnamon and clove fragrance. Lasts pretty much all day. This is what I call the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop scent. That spicey, refreshing scent. Not too overpowering. I actully bought a second bottle of this as a back-up.</li>
            <li> No better body splash than this stuff. Perfect for after shower. Not heavy, and leaves a clean, refreshing after-scent. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bay rums. Scent is great, the burn is great and priced fairly. This and Captain&#x27;s Choice is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great stuff at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like bay rum generally, and think that the regular Clubman aftershave and talc smell nice, so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I couldn&#x27;t even bring myself to put it on--when I opened the bottle, my first impression was that it smelled like a skunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that sounds like I&#x27;m being dramatic--but no, this actually smells like skunk spray.  I tried sniffing it again several times to be sure I wasn&#x27;t just crazy, but it really smells nasty.  If you want bay rum, spend more and go for [[ASIN:B000ETJ3WI Royall Bay Rhum All Purpose Cologne Splash, 8 Ounce]], or some other brand.  If you are looking for something cheap that has a classic, old-fashioned barbershop smell, go for the regular Clubman aftershave ([[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]), or the extremely classic [[ASIN:B001711FMI Clubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce]], or [[ASIN:B005WLLG64 Master Well Comb Spice After Shave Lotion 15 oz]].  Don&#x27;t bother with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF I can bring myself to actually put this on sometime, maybe it will wear differently, and I&#x27;ll edit this review.  But I would only try that if I&#x27;m not going to be around anyone for a few hours, before taking a shower!</li>
            <li> This is by far, my favorite aftershave.  Love the scent, the scent will stay with you for a while too.  Not overpowering after a few minutes, but a nice, pleasant lingering smell the rest of your day.  Beware new shavers, this stuff will BURN when you put it on, it&#x27;s a strong burn that quickly fades.  I got used to it pretty quick, and the scent completely makes up for it.  You will earn your nice smelling face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Clubman products, but this one didn&#x27;t exactly thrill me.  The scent REALLY IS bay rum--and I&#x27;m not a heavy drinker. It would seem to me that it&#x27;s tailored to a black man&#x27;s body chemistry, because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, but it&#x27;s perfect for Eric, my best friend.  He has a tough beard, but due to his allergies, his skin is so sensitive, not even his DE safety razor could stop breakouts after every shave.  Since I gave him my bottle of Virgin Island Bay Rum, he&#x27;s had no more breakouts, and dang it if he hasn&#x27;t started getting all the women!  Well, the Teacher couldn&#x27;t be outdone by the Pupil, so I found the a 6oz bottle of the Clubman classic scented aftershave, and all is well again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the oldschool sophistication of a classic scent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned however, the raving female hordes may require tasing if you wear it too often.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Burns all the way down, but it gets the job done. Get a good chaser.</li>
            <li> Dis a take a me back to de islands an a uh every ting is a irie. Smells sooo goood!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents. It all started when my last bottle of Caswell Massey Lime aftershave ran out. I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.This is with out a doubt one of the finest. It has a scent that is love it or hate it. I LOVE IT! If you like cinnamon clove spice smell you will love this. And if it helps I am in my early 30&#x27;s and my mid 20&#x27;s gf loves the scent as well. She says it makes me smell like pumpkin pie. lol I suppose thats a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite fragrances - I really like it.  Hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and clove - less &#x27;bay rum&#x27; than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  I think it&#x27;s a great fragrance and it keeps my skin feeling moisturized.  I call this one a winner.</li>
            <li> Simply an excellent, old-school bay rum.  Priced well, smells great, and an absolute classic.  Stop reading reviews... buy it, and be manly.</li>
            <li> I splash it on before heading out the door for work. Smells ok and lasts awhile. More or less is an inexpensive after shave.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived as part of a much larger package; it was obvious from the smell of the package and signs of dampness that some leakage had occurred. The twelve ounce bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> I could have bought the $30.00 brand. But why? When it does the job you want. Good smell. Not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price. So buy two!</li>
            <li> Good scent. Very spicy.  This is probably the best bang for the buck in the Bay Rum category.</li>
            <li> I first had Clubman splashed on my face in a barber shop when I was 4 years old, in 1944!  Great product and great to rediscover it at the age of 65!</li>
            <li> This aftershave makes me feel like I stepped back in time. Great price, and I love the scent.  The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that I wish it were in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the stuff. Its smells nice and is  refreshing,  when splashed on after shaving. That said, my wife dumped it down the drain and threatened me with severe bodily injury if I ever purchased it again. In the interest if domestic tranquility,  I&#x27;d check with your better half before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, (and by no means can I back this statement up scientifically); I did noticed  more favorable interactions with members of the opposite sex while wearing it,  just not my wife.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than to be slapped with bay rum after a hot shave. Well, something is better but I can&#x27;t say it out loud. But it does involve bodily fluids. Every man should have a bottle of bay rum in their arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women love bay rum. If she doesn&#x27;t love it then you need to find a new woman.</li>
            <li> Wonderful old time fragrance yet not overwhelming. .</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> Ran out of Dominica and looking for a substitute, I bought this stuff.  Wretched!  Bears the same relationship to real bay rum (rhum) as instant coffee does to brewed coffee - in other words, it&#x27;s smelly brown water.</li>
            <li> 4 Month Review -After switching from Mach III razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the listed product I am using as part of my &amp;#34;Shaving Arsenal.&amp;#34; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right! It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. My wife is very sensitive to smells but this is one she actually admires.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&amp;#34; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish. It was a pretty flat finish for chrome and you could see the several light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained.

            <li> Close but no cigar. Memories are made from this.  My Dad swore by the Clubman brand. A real old genteel mans barber shop requirement. Have used hi- end Bay Rum brands for year but Clubman got this right at a reasonable price. Recommended, Prime shipping a bonus.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in store. Good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried fancier (and much costlier) aftershaves and found that they were just too perfumey. Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum is my idea of a simple, straightforward spicy aroma for a man. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have no clue if this would appeal as much to much younger guys. But if you know the lyrics to a lot of Beatles tunes and remember black and white TV I&#x27;d recommend this aftershave. Please keep in mind though — I still shave with a double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman aftershave and decided to try this one.  I will say that this is my first \\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot; aftershave experience.  I can only describe the scent as cinnamon, spice and sugar (in that order) with none of the typical \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; smells.  Anyway, the first time I used it I was surprised at how gentle the scent is compared to Clubman (which must seem ironic since just below this review is someone complaining about how strong the smell is - but that&#x27;s Amazon for you).  After using it for a few days I think it&#x27;s just right.  For me, I can smell the scent for a few hours after I put it on, then it&#x27;s gone.  I&#x27;m told my by my wife and kids that they can smell it throughout the day when they get within an inch or two of my face, though.  And since they all prefer the Clubman scent to this one, I might save this aftershave for \\&quot;work days.\\&quot;  Nonetheless, I do recommend that you give it a try and see how it works for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite Bay Rum after shave so far.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the old fashioned or old school scent of Bay Rum. As much as she likes to buy me the more complex, newer style colognes, she still really likes the simple but cutting aroma that fills the air when I splash a little on.</li>
            <li> Nice item and will buy more when this is gone</li>
    </ol>
