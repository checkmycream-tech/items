            <li>I ordered Revagin Eye Cream along with this product from this seller, and had good luck with it too (see review on Revagin Eye Nourishing Cream w/ Liposomes).</li>
            <li>Neuvaderm is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell all that good either.</li>
            <li>I loved the way this went on my skin and the way my face felt afterwards..</li>
            <li>With these, I am definetely getting a good result.</li>
            <li>Good moistureizer...</li>
            <li>and we have tried so very many.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Try it, you too will love it!</li>
            <li>I love this since I no longer have to worry about break-outs!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>It feels very good on my skin, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m happy because my skin looks much smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been month&#x27;s now since I wrote this review and even though I have really liked this product, it has come to my attention that it contains two ingredient&#x27;s, Butylene Glycol and Propylene Glycol which are both toxic according to the EPA, which warns against contact to prevent brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way my skin felt using the Neuvaderm, but just can&#x27;t continue using it anymore because of the health risks.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to bring this to everyone&#x27;s attention so you can make your own choice.</li>
            <li>I had to email Customer Service A question and received fast and wonderful service.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the customer service.</li>
            <li>While I believe Dr. Oz is a brilliant heart surgeon, I&#x27;m not a blind Oziac follower.  </li>
            <li>While I believe Dr. Oz is a brilliant heart surgeon, I&#x27;m not a blind Oziac follower.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles are not as deep all around good product excellent price can&#x27;t beat it!  </li>
            <li>Atlantic Wholesale provided timely customer service and were very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Most of them I found were not as effective as Neuvaderm.</li>
            <li>but I love the anti-oxidant properties this creams has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are better off with Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomagrante Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>then opened the top cap of the dispenser and found the problem</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t been able to try product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything from these people again.</li>
            <li>I love the price as well.  </li>
            <li>I waited to write a review until I was sure of this product.</li>
            <li>Many of the top selling anti-aging creams, including Olay have them in their&#x27;s also.</li>
            <li>sure there are many more.</li>
            <li>The pump does not work as so many people have mentioned on here.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the best facial cream we have ever used</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This product is ok but</li>
            <li>No scent would be better.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>Does what it says, love it.</li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>The silky cream is like magic on my skin.</li>
            <li>you have to unscrew the top and scoop the rest out with a qtip or pop sickle stick</li>
            <li>you have sensative skin stay away from this product it does not work any better then</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, and will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully and I am extremley happy to report that it really works.</li>
            <li>It has diminished the appearance of my marks and some are so light i can no longer see them!</li>
            <li>Okay...</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz mentioned Argireline on his show, but many of the magic solutions he purports do not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  </li>
            <li>Until I get more info, I&#x27;m not buying Neuvaderm.g must be within that mile.  </li>

            <li>Until I get more info, I&#x27;m not buying Neuvaderm.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredible soft, since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>Love the Neuvaderm cream from Skin Origins.</li>
            <li>and my skin has a \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The cream dispensed the exact amount of cream needed to cover the full face which was great.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with fine lines and wrinkles, and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I immediately checked Amazon to see their price and more importantly, the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless designer label anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products costing hundreds of dollars and none of them produced the incredible results Neuvaderm has.  </li>
            <li>This is not a fake review but honest review .</li>
            <li>The cream goes on so smooth and dries really easy.</li>
            <li>It provides a lot of moisture, is not greasy and seems to be reducing the appearance of some fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month, and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already noticing the disappearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve nothing to lose with the purchase of Neuvaderm anti-aging moisturizer, except your fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine</li>
            <li>Neuvaderm cream goes on smooth and dries really easy.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks great, less blemishes, more even tone, and I have a better glow.</li>
            <li>Neuvaderm is such a good lotion my skin loves it very light</li>
            <li>Are the ingredients even listed accurately?  </li>
            <li>Are the ingredients even listed accurately?  </li>
            <li>It is a light cream and is good for sensitive skin that does not clog pores, would recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I got a free bottle from a friend in a Christmas gift basket at work</li>
            <li>If this is such a great product and does all it claims.</li>
            <li>Not to sound rash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t endorse many product&#x27;s, but this is a good one and contrary to what the one reviewer said about also giving review&#x27;s on male enhancement, I don&#x27;t know anything about that</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I am almost out of my latest bottle and will definitely be ordering this from Amazon as they have great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews I decided I had to try it.</li>
            <li>My skin has a super silky feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After I replied to their non-answer, they emailed with another non-answer, \\&quot;We don&#x27;t have the exact %&#x27;s available for our products.  </li>
            <li>It was on sale to be truthful, so I tried it and have found my new cream.</li>
            <li>thanks neuvaderm!!</li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t have many yet, but the ones I had are still there looking like they did the day I started using this.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old with a medium skin tone and love to tan.</li>
            <li>My face feels soo soft and my complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>but it is worth</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the past 6 moths for a new face cream/wrinkle cream and ordered this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Neuvaderm is nothing less than AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>and I am sure many other reviewer&#x27;s don&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>It is nice feeling and seems to stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li>I recommend this facial cream to anyone looking to buy an effective cream for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that Amazon sells it for so cheap as I thought it would be twice the cost.</li>
            <li>Company sent me two more bottles of same product instead of refund.</li>
            <li>It seems that my laugh lines are not as prominant, have thought about the need for some form of filler and then realized I really can&#x27;t afford procedure.</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say that I have been using this product since December 2012.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely going to resume using my Olay and Neutrogena products when this is used up.</li>
            <li>It seems that many of the reviewers are also promoting male enhancement products.</li>
            <li>This is my  first review that I have ever endorsed.</li>
            <li>I think something funny is going on with this product for a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>so I have stretch marks, and i was really going to give up!</li>
            <li>First I tried contacting Skin Origins, the manufacturer of Neuvaderm, to ask what percentage of the product was Argireline.  </li>
            <li>For those die-hards who condemn my 1-star rating without trying the product, perhaps you should try to find out exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To research a health product/device/procedure/drug/therapy, I recommend that consumers search for support in medical journals and not on Internet vendor sites, many of which are disguised as research sites.  </li>

            <li>To research a health product/device/procedure/drug/therapy, I recommend that consumers search for support in medical journals and not on Internet vendor sites, many of which are disguised as research sites.  </li>
            <li>Neuvaderm cream went on nice and smooth and dried fast.</li>
            <li>Today I finally noticed a difference, looking through some photos and comparing, and can say that lines are becoming smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.</li>
            <li>It penetrates the skin, weaken&#x27;s proteins and cellular structures; it&#x27;s found in anti-freeze and is strong enough to remove barnacles from boats!!</li>
            <li>I loved the cream but kept thinking there was no more as the pump does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I think there comes a time when you are better off not to try something new unless it comes local.  </li>
            <li>Kelly from customer service asked me to check the hole at the bottom of the bottle to make sure nothing is blocking it, and try to pump it quite a few times to get the lotion to the top of the bottle if possible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>have very sensative skin and this product after 2 days use caused my skin to break out and soon as I stopped</li>
            <li>so there is no way for it to suck up the product past the very top of the bottle</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything.</li>
            <li>it was very helpful in reducing the appearance of the mouth wrinkles i was hoping to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but with my experience this product is very helpful beyond just moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the pump bottle because it doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>But I could find absolutely nothing on the company, which was suspicious to me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my face yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazingly, it really works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout.</li>
            <li>Skin felt very moist and elastic afterwards.</li>
            <li>This cream came in the same unique silver bottle that looked very high end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good, if not better, than products I have used that are 3 times the price!</li>
            <li>and I live in hot humid Florida.</li>
            <li>I have access to all medical journals through my job, but consumers can read many journal abstracts of studies via online medical search engines.  </li>
            <li>I have access to all medical journals through my job, but consumers can read many journal abstracts of studies via online medical search engines.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this anti-aging cream but was disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other amazing thing is, it is only a fraction of the cost of all the designer name products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and this has made a real difference.</li>
            <li>Consumers have the right to know information on the safety and effectiveness of products they buy--including the percentage of key ingredients.  </li>

            <li>Fills in fine lines and corrects overall dullness for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am prone to acne, especially when I first change moisturizers, but have had no problems with this one, which is why I will continue to use it for the time</li>
            <li>She explained that the pumps used in these bottles are designed without that tube running down the middle to make it easier to use all the lotion in the bottle, and it works kind of like an air vacuum.</li>
            <li>Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Complete junk.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much for the tiny wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It really is soft and silky and feels like a million bucks on my skin.</li>
            <li>it left my skin very greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it seems to dimenish some of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Acetyl hexapeptide-8 (Argireline) is a synthetic peptide that reduces wrinkle depth, and it has promising results in trials published in medical journals--</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin condition.</li>
            <li>Finally there is an anti-aging and anti-wrinkle  product that really works and produces visible results.  </li>
            <li>However, I cannot really tell how much this product is contributing to the result because I am combining with other products, DHS eye cream in the morning and DHS olive virgin oil at night.</li>
            <li>Bottle was half full.  </li>
            <li>, I do not look 5 years younger, but my skin has not gotten any older either.</li>
            <li>so they SAY they go the extra mile, but evidently determining the concentration of a key ingredient is beyond that mile.  </li>
            <li>That being said, my skin has become uneven and the fine lines are really starting to show.</li>
            <li>Also, she advised me if it&#x27;s still not working to take the Neuvaderm with me on vacation, and when I want to use it to just unscrew the cap and get the cream out that way, and to use it liberally, because she will send me a new bottle when I get back.</li>
            <li>I have been able to effectively get rid of the EXPENSIVE facial cream that I was hooked on for the past year now that i have found Neuvaderm!</li>
            <li>but have not really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>, would have preferred to scoop it up from a jar as to use every last bit and not waste.  </li>
            <li>Have only used this product for about a week, but nothing has improved so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t make a 69 year old look 20, but it definitely has taken off a decade of wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I left this cream and went to Life Cell, bad mistake, after 4 bottles of lifecell my skin looked worse than before, I am back with Nuvaderm, it makes my skin glow for a fraction of the cost of LIfeCell, it is a great product,one reviewer wrote that it contained harmful ingredients, we breath harmful substances everyday of our life which create toxins inside our body, you have to eat right and take supplements to reduce these toxins, I have been using this cream for a year and my skin just keeps on looking better, if these substances were so harmful why are they not taking the skin off of my face?  </li>
            <li>for sensative skin this is not a good choice, it also does not go on smooth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> It feels very good on my skin, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m happy because my skin looks much smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been month&#x27;s now since I wrote this review and even though I have really liked this product, it has come to my attention that it contains two ingredient&#x27;s, Butylene Glycol and Propylene Glycol which are both toxic according to the EPA, which warns against contact to prevent brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way my skin felt using the Neuvaderm, but just can&#x27;t continue using it anymore because of the health risks.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to bring this to everyone&#x27;s attention so you can make your own choice.</li>
            <li> I had to email Customer Service A question and received fast and wonderful service.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the customer service.</li>
            <li> While I believe Dr. Oz is a brilliant heart surgeon, I&#x27;m not a blind Oziac follower.  </li>
            <li> While I believe Dr. Oz is a brilliant heart surgeon, I&#x27;m not a blind Oziac follower.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles are not as deep all around good product excellent price can&#x27;t beat it!  </li>
            <li> Atlantic Wholesale provided timely customer service and were very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Most of them I found were not as effective as Neuvaderm.</li>
            <li> but I love the anti-oxidant properties this creams has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are better off with Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomagrante Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> then opened the top cap of the dispenser and found the problem</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t been able to try product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything from these people again.</li>
            <li> I love the price as well.  </li>
            <li> I waited to write a review until I was sure of this product.</li>
            <li> Many of the top selling anti-aging creams, including Olay have them in their&#x27;s also.</li>
            <li> sure there are many more.</li>
            <li> The pump does not work as so many people have mentioned on here.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best facial cream we have ever used</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This product is ok but</li>
            <li> No scent would be better.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li> Does what it says, love it.</li>
            <li> The product is ok.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a nice feel.  </li>
            <li> The silky cream is like magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> you have to unscrew the top and scoop the rest out with a qtip or pop sickle stick</li>
            <li> you have sensative skin stay away from this product it does not work any better then</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, and will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully and I am extremley happy to report that it really works.</li>
            <li> It has diminished the appearance of my marks and some are so light i can no longer see them!</li>
            <li> Okay...</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz mentioned Argireline on his show, but many of the magic solutions he purports do not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  </li>
            <li> Until I get more info, I&#x27;m not buying Neuvaderm.g must be within that mile.  </li>

            <li> Until I get more info, I&#x27;m not buying Neuvaderm.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredible soft, since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Neuvaderm cream from Skin Origins.</li>
            <li> and my skin has a \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The cream dispensed the exact amount of cream needed to cover the full face which was great.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with fine lines and wrinkles, and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I immediately checked Amazon to see their price and more importantly, the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless designer label anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products costing hundreds of dollars and none of them produced the incredible results Neuvaderm has.  </li>
            <li> This is not a fake review but honest review .</li>
            <li> The cream goes on so smooth and dries really easy.</li>
            <li> It provides a lot of moisture, is not greasy and seems to be reducing the appearance of some fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already noticing the disappearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve nothing to lose with the purchase of Neuvaderm anti-aging moisturizer, except your fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm cream goes on smooth and dries really easy.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks great, less blemishes, more even tone, and I have a better glow.</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm is such a good lotion my skin loves it very light</li>
            <li> Are the ingredients even listed accurately?  </li>
            <li> Are the ingredients even listed accurately?  </li>
            <li> It is a light cream and is good for sensitive skin that does not clog pores, would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I got a free bottle from a friend in a Christmas gift basket at work</li>
            <li> If this is such a great product and does all it claims.</li>
            <li> Not to sound rash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t endorse many product&#x27;s, but this is a good one and contrary to what the one reviewer said about also giving review&#x27;s on male enhancement, I don&#x27;t know anything about that</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I am almost out of my latest bottle and will definitely be ordering this from Amazon as they have great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews I decided I had to try it.</li>
            <li> My skin has a super silky feel after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After I replied to their non-answer, they emailed with another non-answer, \\&quot;We don&#x27;t have the exact %&#x27;s available for our products.  </li>
            <li> It was on sale to be truthful, so I tried it and have found my new cream.</li>
            <li> thanks neuvaderm!!</li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t have many yet, but the ones I had are still there looking like they did the day I started using this.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old with a medium skin tone and love to tan.</li>
            <li> My face feels soo soft and my complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> but it is worth</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the past 6 moths for a new face cream/wrinkle cream and ordered this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm is nothing less than AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> and I am sure many other reviewer&#x27;s don&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> It is nice feeling and seems to stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend this facial cream to anyone looking to buy an effective cream for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I am very surprised that Amazon sells it for so cheap as I thought it would be twice the cost.</li>
            <li> Company sent me two more bottles of same product instead of refund.</li>
            <li> It seems that my laugh lines are not as prominant, have thought about the need for some form of filler and then realized I really can&#x27;t afford procedure.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I have been using this product since December 2012.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely going to resume using my Olay and Neutrogena products when this is used up.</li>
            <li> It seems that many of the reviewers are also promoting male enhancement products.</li>
            <li> This is my  first review that I have ever endorsed.</li>
            <li> I think something funny is going on with this product for a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> so I have stretch marks, and i was really going to give up!</li>
            <li> First I tried contacting Skin Origins, the manufacturer of Neuvaderm, to ask what percentage of the product was Argireline.  </li>
            <li> For those die-hards who condemn my 1-star rating without trying the product, perhaps you should try to find out exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To research a health product/device/procedure/drug/therapy, I recommend that consumers search for support in medical journals and not on Internet vendor sites, many of which are disguised as research sites.  </li>

            <li> Neuvaderm cream went on nice and smooth and dried fast.</li>
            <li> Today I finally noticed a difference, looking through some photos and comparing, and can say that lines are becoming smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.</li>
            <li> It penetrates the skin, weaken&#x27;s proteins and cellular structures; it&#x27;s found in anti-freeze and is strong enough to remove barnacles from boats!!</li>
            <li> I loved the cream but kept thinking there was no more as the pump does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> I think there comes a time when you are better off not to try something new unless it comes local.  </li>
            <li> Kelly from customer service asked me to check the hole at the bottom of the bottle to make sure nothing is blocking it, and try to pump it quite a few times to get the lotion to the top of the bottle if possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> have very sensative skin and this product after 2 days use caused my skin to break out and soon as I stopped</li>
            <li> so there is no way for it to suck up the product past the very top of the bottle</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything.</li>
            <li> it was very helpful in reducing the appearance of the mouth wrinkles i was hoping to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but with my experience this product is very helpful beyond just moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the pump bottle because it doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> But I could find absolutely nothing on the company, which was suspicious to me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my face yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazingly, it really works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout.</li>
            <li> Skin felt very moist and elastic afterwards.</li>
            <li> This cream came in the same unique silver bottle that looked very high end.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good, if not better, than products I have used that are 3 times the price!</li>
            <li> and I live in hot humid Florida.</li>
            <li> I have access to all medical journals through my job, but consumers can read many journal abstracts of studies via online medical search engines.  </li>
            <li> I have access to all medical journals through my job, but consumers can read many journal abstracts of studies via online medical search engines.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this anti-aging cream but was disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other amazing thing is, it is only a fraction of the cost of all the designer name products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and this has made a real difference.</li>
            <li> Consumers have the right to know information on the safety and effectiveness of products they buy--including the percentage of key ingredients.  </li>

            <li> Fills in fine lines and corrects overall dullness for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am prone to acne, especially when I first change moisturizers, but have had no problems with this one, which is why I will continue to use it for the time</li>
            <li> She explained that the pumps used in these bottles are designed without that tube running down the middle to make it easier to use all the lotion in the bottle, and it works kind of like an air vacuum.</li>
            <li> Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete junk.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much for the tiny wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It really is soft and silky and feels like a million bucks on my skin.</li>
            <li> it left my skin very greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it seems to dimenish some of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Acetyl hexapeptide-8 (Argireline) is a synthetic peptide that reduces wrinkle depth, and it has promising results in trials published in medical journals--</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin condition.</li>
            <li> Finally there is an anti-aging and anti-wrinkle  product that really works and produces visible results.  </li>
            <li> However, I cannot really tell how much this product is contributing to the result because I am combining with other products, DHS eye cream in the morning and DHS olive virgin oil at night.</li>
            <li> Bottle was half full.  </li>
            <li> , I do not look 5 years younger, but my skin has not gotten any older either.</li>
            <li> so they SAY they go the extra mile, but evidently determining the concentration of a key ingredient is beyond that mile.  </li>
            <li> That being said, my skin has become uneven and the fine lines are really starting to show.</li>
            <li> Also, she advised me if it&#x27;s still not working to take the Neuvaderm with me on vacation, and when I want to use it to just unscrew the cap and get the cream out that way, and to use it liberally, because she will send me a new bottle when I get back.</li>
            <li> I have been able to effectively get rid of the EXPENSIVE facial cream that I was hooked on for the past year now that i have found Neuvaderm!</li>
            <li> but have not really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> , would have preferred to scoop it up from a jar as to use every last bit and not waste.  </li>
            <li> Have only used this product for about a week, but nothing has improved so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t make a 69 year old look 20, but it definitely has taken off a decade of wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I left this cream and went to Life Cell, bad mistake, after 4 bottles of lifecell my skin looked worse than before, I am back with Nuvaderm, it makes my skin glow for a fraction of the cost of LIfeCell, it is a great product,one reviewer wrote that it contained harmful ingredients, we breath harmful substances everyday of our life which create toxins inside our body, you have to eat right and take supplements to reduce these toxins, I have been using this cream for a year and my skin just keeps on looking better, if these substances were so harmful why are they not taking the skin off of my face?  </li>
            <li> for sensative skin this is not a good choice, it also does not go on smooth</li>
            <li> The other five are PEG-100, which reduces the skin&#x27;s natural moisture and is used in oven cleaner&#x27;s, PEG 150, same as above, Triethanolamine, which can cause liver and kidney cancer, Methylparaben, linked to Breast cancer, and Parfume/fragrance, which is toxic.</li>
            <li> The product is decent but a little greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the purpose for this review is to notify people about the actual ingredients of this product (in case someone has an allergy or sensitive skin), which have not been listed accurately on Amazon, something I have been finding with disturbing regularity on a number of Amazon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients listed on the actual Neuvaderm container that are not listed on Amazon include: zingiber officinale (ginger root) extract, grapefruit seed extract, and citrus aurantium (bitter orange peel)</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> It clogged my pores and I developed black heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous anti-aging moisturizers in the past, with little success.</li>
            <li> have been able to eleminate the expensive facial creams that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> With dry winter weather my face was so dry.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was skeptical about this, but for the low price versus department store cosmetics, figured it was worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is annoying and wasteful to dump more than is necessary for one facial application into one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Does that mean it contains a high percentage of Argireline?  </li>
            <li> only problem ,I have to leave bottle upside down because it does not pump well</li>
            <li> hidden manufacturer led me to believe Neuvaderm was made for specific vendors.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the face cream since i have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Six months later I have noticed no significant change to my skin</li>
            <li> but this is a  total waste of consumer money.  </li>
            <li> but there is absolutely no difference in the depth and number of wrinkles on my face after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> the ingredients listed on Amazon are not in the same order as on the container, so the ingredient concentrations are not accurate.</li>
            <li> Since it works gradually, you notice a bit of difference yourself, but the people who don&#x27;t see you that often really notice a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> none , so , I have to use other solution to rinse out the lotion inside to use it..</li>
            <li> I got this product since the other brand I was using, Kumaara, was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I will wait and see, but at this point this product is not any different from my usual product.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I&#x27;ve already received a few compliments about my skin tone, etc.</li>
            <li> but slowly they are less apparent then before.</li>
            <li> The price is NOT right for the amount.</li>
            <li> my skin didnt like it either as it never really absorbed</li>
            <li> So they cannot be held accountable for the false claims and the claims as far as</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using the product the black heads did not return.</li>
            <li> However, I do like how tight my face feels after I apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> I received my order in just a few days, but the pump was not working.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of me using it my husband commented that my face looked lighter and fresher.</li>
            <li> No effect, and too $$$ Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Terrific product but not a great container.  </li>
            <li> I am all for giving small companies chances but when you cannot track them down and the web address is not valid on the bottle either</li>
            <li> it has a very weird texture very gooey like ghostbusters ectoplasm and</li>
            <li> Not sure why I stopped using that moisturizer come to think of it.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller expecting all the inconveniences that usually come with any exchange.</li>
            <li> So, for now, I will continue to use this product because it&#x27;s made a small difference, will continue to use and reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I usually use a lancome product $90.00 for our face.</li>
            <li> The desire that a cream will somehow turn back the ravages of time is laughable.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> So I suspect that they are likely fake.</li>
            <li> pump like many have said is terrible , I unscrewed the top and found immediately 1 of the reasons its terrible</li>
            <li> I used everything over the counter, and basically wasted money!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the expensive mosturizes I used to use get.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why others have said it did not.</li>
            <li> very few anti-wrinkle ingredients stand up to this scientific scrutiny.  </li>
            <li> It was very harsh on my skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works great. With dry winter weather my face was so dry. I used this twice a day and it just moistens my skin and takes all the dryness away. I love this product and highly recommend it. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial wrinkles but I love the anti-oxidant properties this creams has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if the cream has the results that are promised. Now I&#x27;m happy because my skin looks much smooth</li>
            <li> The product is decent but a little greasy. The price is NOT right for the amount. I used itsparingly (about a pencil eraser per day) It only lasted one week. I will not be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off with Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomagrante Moisturizer. Not sure why I stopped using that moisturizer come to think of it.</li>
            <li> This purchase was disappointing.  The cream did not dispense from the pump even after several pumping actions.&lt;br /&gt;I then opened the top cap of the dispenser and found the problem -- the cream did not reach the bottom of the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;I have returned the product and hope the refund will arrive soon.</li>
            <li> I have been able to effectively get rid of the EXPENSIVE facial cream that I was hooked on for the past year now that i have found Neuvaderm! I got a free bottle from a friend in a Christmas gift basket at work and I absolutely love it. The cream goes on so smooth and dries really easy. My skin has a super silky feel after I use it. LOVE IT! I am very surprised that Amazon sells it for so cheap as I thought it would be twice the cost. I am almost out of my latest bottle and will definitely be ordering this from Amazon as they have great prices and fast shipping. I recommend this facial cream to anyone looking to buy an effective cream for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Purchased product, but pump to produce product didn&#x27;t work. So I requested refund. Company sent me two more bottles of same product instead of refund. Neither one of these pumps worked either, defective bottles. Still haven&#x27;t been able to try product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything from these people again. It&#x27;s too exhausting to get refund &amp; even communicate with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered Neuvaderm Rejuvenating Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Moisturizing Cream to take with me on my vocation. I received my order in just a few days, but the pump was not working. I contacted the seller expecting all the inconveniences that usually come with any exchange. I received a response in no time. Kelly from customer service asked me to check the hole at the bottom of the bottle to make sure nothing is blocking it, and try to pump it quite a few times to get the lotion to the top of the bottle if possible. She explained that the pumps used in these bottles are designed without that tube running down the middle to make it easier to use all the lotion in the bottle, and it works kind of like an air vacuum. Also, she advised me if it&#x27;s still not working to take the Neuvaderm with me on vacation, and when I want to use it to just unscrew the cap and get the cream out that way, and to use it liberally, because she will send me a new bottle when I get back. I had to shake the cream out of the bottle on my vocation, but the replacement was in my mailbox when I got back, and they let me to keep both bottles. What excellent customer service!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now twice a day. It feels very good on my skin, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well. It works on wrinkles as well. Today I finally noticed a difference, looking through some photos and comparing, and can say that lines are becoming smoother. After just a few days of me using it my husband commented that my face looked lighter and fresher. Hopefully the results will last and improve over time. I love the price as well.  I ordered Revagin Eye Cream along with this product from this seller, and had good luck with it too (see review on Revagin Eye Nourishing Cream w/ Liposomes).</li>
            <li> I used this product as stated on the label from the time of it&#x27;s arrival. It did absolutey nothing that it claims it will. I know i can&#x27;t expect miracles but this is a  total waste of consumer money.  Also the pump on it worked only twice after that i had to open the bottle to remove the lotion. Complete junk.</li>
            <li> I use this product as directed, once in the morning and once at night. It seems that my laugh lines are not as prominant, have thought about the need for some form of filler and then realized I really can&#x27;t afford procedure. So, for now, I will continue to use this product because it&#x27;s made a small difference, will continue to use and reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I have been using this product since December 2012. Six months later I have noticed no significant change to my skin, I do not look 5 years younger, but my skin has not gotten any older either. After saying that, I do like this product. I am prone to acne, especially when I first change moisturizers, but have had no problems with this one, which is why I will continue to use it for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the purpose for this review is to notify people about the actual ingredients of this product (in case someone has an allergy or sensitive skin), which have not been listed accurately on Amazon, something I have been finding with disturbing regularity on a number of Amazon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients listed on the actual Neuvaderm container that are not listed on Amazon include: zingiber officinale (ginger root) extract, grapefruit seed extract, and citrus aurantium (bitter orange peel) extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients listed on Amazon that are not on the Neuvaderm container include: methyl paraben and propyl paraben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the ingredients listed on Amazon are not in the same order as on the container, so the ingredient concentrations are not accurate.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review until I was sure of this product. I have used the Neuvaderm now for just over three month&#x27;s and it definitely has diminished wrinkles and tightened the skin on my neck. I am 65 years old and this has made a real difference. I use this during the daytime and then a Retinol product at night. I read an article that said use an anti aging cream with Palmitoyl Pentapeptide and Acetyl Hexapeptide 3 in it and this has both. Dr. Oz also mentioned those two ingredient&#x27;s when recommending what to look for in an anti-aging cream. I don&#x27;t endorse many product&#x27;s, but this is a good one and contrary to what the one reviewer said about also giving review&#x27;s on male enhancement, I don&#x27;t know anything about that and I am sure many other reviewer&#x27;s don&#x27;t either. I am giving a review because this product work&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been month&#x27;s now since I wrote this review and even though I have really liked this product, it has come to my attention that it contains two ingredient&#x27;s, Butylene Glycol and Propylene Glycol which are both toxic according to the EPA, which warns against contact to prevent brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities. It penetrates the skin, weaken&#x27;s proteins and cellular structures; it&#x27;s found in anti-freeze and is strong enough to remove barnacles from boats!! This is not the only product which contains these ingredient&#x27;s. Many of the top selling anti-aging creams, including Olay have them in their&#x27;s also. Avon&#x27;s Dramatic Firming has all seven ingredient&#x27;s on the list of Carcinogenic and Toxic Ingredient&#x27;s. The other five are PEG-100, which reduces the skin&#x27;s natural moisture and is used in oven cleaner&#x27;s, PEG 150, same as above, Triethanolamine, which can cause liver and kidney cancer, Methylparaben, linked to Breast cancer, and Parfume/fragrance, which is toxic. Derma E is a line that offer&#x27;s cream&#x27;s with peptides and lot&#x27;s of vitamins that works well and doesn&#x27;t contain these ingredient&#x27;s. Reviva Lab&#x27;s has product&#x27;s without also andam sure there are many more. I really liked the way my skin felt using the Neuvaderm, but just can&#x27;t continue using it anymore because of the health risks. Just wanted to bring this to everyone&#x27;s attention so you can make your own choice.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I am disappointed to say the least. The pump does not work as so many people have mentioned on here. The website on the bottle does not exist.  This is a low quality and fraudulent product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I usually use a lancome product $90.00 for our face. I have to say this is the best facial cream we have ever used and we have tried so very many. I love it and I live in hot humid Florida. I&#x27;m 34 and he&#x27;s 42. My skin is super smooth.</li>
            <li> The desire that a cream will somehow turn back the ravages of time is laughable.  Neuvaderm is a good moisturizer but there is absolutely no difference in the depth and number of wrinkles on my face after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin softer.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t deal with the smell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product is ok but probably not something I&#x27;ll order again. It feels like smearing vasoline all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t smell all that good either. No scent would be better. As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t have many yet, but the ones I had are still there looking like they did the day I started using this. Meaning they did not diminish or fade away. I&#x27;m most likely going to resume using my Olay and Neutrogena products when this is used up.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my daughter and was disappointed in the quantity you get for what you pay for it.  Wouldn&#x27;t fill a teaspoon.  Bottle was half full.  Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> No effect, and too $$$ Don&#x27;t waste your money. I tried this for a month then switched back to Oil of Olay Night time. (which I don&#x27;t have to buy on line and pay shipping for). This is a rip off.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  I was researching on line face creams and thought for the price I&#x27;d give it a try!  It&#x27;s as good, if not better, than products I have used that are 3 times the price! I am very pleased, and delighted with the company!</li>
            <li> I loved the cream but kept thinking there was no more as the pump does not work very well.  probably wont order again</li>
            <li> the bottle had no tube to pump it out and its to thick to shake out. I contacted the seller they immediately sent me another that also has no tube. I have pounded out enough to use it on my eyes daily for about a mo. but have not really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> Unable to pump , found out there is no tube connect to the pumper on the top , none , so , I have to use other solution to rinse out the lotion inside to use it..very annoying , maybe the price is low because we can not even get it out</li>
            <li> I loved the way this went on my skin and the way my face felt afterwards..Great Product!!! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> It seems that many of the reviewers are also promoting male enhancement products. So I suspect that they are likely fake. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and so far, so good.  It provides a lot of moisture, is not greasy and seems to be reducing the appearance of some fine lines.  Atlantic Wholesale provided timely customer service and were very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 months. It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine lines. However, it does contain shea butter(oil)so it is not for everyone. It clogged my pores and I developed black heads. Once I stopped using the product the black heads did not return.</li>
            <li> I got this product since the other brand I was using, Kumaara, was discontinued. I have been using this for about a month, and it seems to be working fine.  However, I cannot really tell how much this product is contributing to the result because I am combining with other products, DHS eye cream in the morning and DHS olive virgin oil at night. With these, I am definetely getting a good result.</li>
            <li> i used your product  for 2 weeks and i did not noticed any changes on my face.</li>
            <li> The product is ok. I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the wrinkles. I also don&#x27;t feel like there is enough of a moisturizer in it. However, I do like how tight my face feels after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a nice feel.  Couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much for the tiny wrinkles.  I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm (1.7 fl Oz.) Rejuvenating Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Moisturizing Cream (Health and Beauty)is truly a 5 start product. The silky cream is like magic on my skin. I have been looking for the past 6 moths for a new face cream/wrinkle cream and ordered this wonderful product. It was on sale to be truthful, so I tried it and have found my new cream. It really is soft and silky and feels like a million bucks on my skin. Thank you Neuvaderm, you are now my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I had to email Customer Service A question and received fast and wonderful service. This is my  first review that I have ever endorsed.So does that tell you how happy I am with Neuvaderm. Buy it and try it, you wont be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Reiter&lt;br /&gt;Sunny South Florida</li>
            <li> I think something funny is going on with this product for a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1 - the web addresses on the bottle doesnt exist.&lt;br /&gt;2 - the company name skin origins nowhere to be found on google&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does that mean? Well it means if the product is bad or you have a complaint there is nowhere to complain to. So why would a company do that ? If this is such a great product and does all it claims. So they cannot be held accountable for the false claims and the claims as far as im concerned are false.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as I have been testing various anti aging skin products, from chanel ultra correction lift, auravie, levela, loreal, olay, no7 , clarins.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensative skin and this product after 2 days use caused my skin to break out and soon as I stopped it cleared up. So I tried it again and the same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;So for sensative skin this is not a good choice, it also does not go on smooth it has a very weird texture very gooey like ghostbusters ectoplasm and my skin didnt like it either as it never really absorbed it left my skin very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The pump like many have said is terrible , I unscrewed the top and found immediately 1 of the reasons its terrible there is no tube or straw attached to it so there is no way for it to suck up the product past the very top of the bottle so once you use it about 10 times thats it you have to unscrew the top and scoop the rest out with a qtip or pop sickle stick this is a completly terrible useless design of a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So not only does the product not work the bottle is a junk design also.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensative skin stay away from this product it does not work any better then the shoddy bottle its packaged in. I am all for giving small companies chances but when you cannot track them down and the web address is not valid on the bottle either then you know something is wrong. Some good products i have and tried are chanel ultra correction lift, L&#x27;oreal Rivitalift, Olay proX , boot No7 protect &amp; perfect.</li>
            <li> I left this cream and went to Life Cell, bad mistake, after 4 bottles of lifecell my skin looked worse than before, I am back with Nuvaderm, it makes my skin glow for a fraction of the cost of LIfeCell, it is a great product,one reviewer wrote that it contained harmful ingredients, we breath harmful substances everyday of our life which create toxins inside our body, you have to eat right and take supplements to reduce these toxins, I have been using this cream for a year and my skin just keeps on looking better, if these substances were so harmful why are they not taking the skin off of my face?  Sorry, I just don&#x27;t believe everything the media puts out there.</li>
            <li> I must say I do notice a difference in my look.  I am satisfied, and will continue to use this product.  I was using another brand, and will switch to this exclusively.  thanks neuvaderm!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It didn&#x27;t help with fine lines and wrinkles, and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme and tried it on my face it was very helpful in reducing the appearance of the mouth wrinkles i was hoping to remove.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight but slowly they are less apparent then before. This is not a fake review but honest review . There is no miracle cure and i don&#x27;t know the percentages of anything in the bottle but with my experience this product is very helpful beyond just moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old with a medium skin tone and love to tan. That being said, my skin has become uneven and the fine lines are really starting to show. I&#x27;ve tried many products, some of them being quite expensive. While doing some research online I came across Neuvaderm. I immediately checked Amazon to see their price and more importantly, the reviews. After reading so many positive reviews I decided I had to try it. I use Neuvaderm in the morning and at night after washing my face. It&#x27;s not too thick or oily (I have oily skin) so I can apply make-up over it. After only a few days I&#x27;ve already received a few compliments about my skin tone, etc. I assume this will only improve with time. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found something that seems to work and won&#x27;t break the bank in the process!!</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again. Cannot see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any of my friends! My mother and I both use this product and would swear by it.  My skin feels and looks great, less blemishes, more even tone, and I have a better glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 months ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully and I am extremley happy to report that it really works. I just had a baby so I have stretch marks, and i was really going to give up! I used everything over the counter, and basically wasted money! I found Strevaxl and thought i would give it a try. I can honestly say I LOVE IT! It has diminished the appearance of my marks and some are so light i can no longer see them! I would recommend this product to any woman struggling with stretch marks! Try it, you too will love it!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to dimenish some of the wrinkles.  It&#x27;s a little greasy.  I really don&#x27;t like the pump bottle because it doesn&#x27;t work very well, would have preferred to scoop it up from a jar as to use every last bit and not waste.  Will probably try another product next time.  Although the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Acetyl hexapeptide-8 (Argireline) is a synthetic peptide that reduces wrinkle depth, and it has promising results in trials published in medical journals--very few anti-wrinkle ingredients stand up to this scientific scrutiny.  The recommended strength in these scientific studies is 10% Argireline as part of an oil/water emulsion product.  Some vendors sell anti-wrinkle creams with 15% or 25% Argireline, but based on the lack of long-term studies, I&#x27;d rather try a product with 10% concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuvaderm ingredient info provided to consumers, which is supposedly in descending order of components, lists acetyl hexapeptide-8 before glycerin.  That sounds encouraging.  Does that mean it contains a high percentage of Argireline?  First I tried contacting Skin Origins, the manufacturer of Neuvaderm, to ask what percentage of the product was Argireline.  But I could find absolutely nothing on the company, which was suspicious to me.  How can I find out anything about this \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; product, if I cannot even find the manufacturer?  Does anyone with a Skin Origins product have any contact info they can share?  BTW, Neuvaderm is not the same as Neuviderm, and Skin Origins is not the same as Origins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hidden manufacturer led me to believe Neuvaderm was made for specific vendors.  So I emailed the Amazon vendor, American Health Supplies.  They replied within several hours, \\&quot;Thank you for inquisition. This is a proprietary formula.\\&quot;  ??!  My question wasn&#x27;t quite as severe as an inquisition, but I was shocked to receive that reply from them.  I didn&#x27;t ask for their formula--no companies would provide that!  After I replied to their non-answer, they emailed with another non-answer, \\&quot;We don&#x27;t have the exact %&#x27;s available for our products.  We go the extra mile for our customers.  Again, I truly apologize.\\&quot;  Okay...so they SAY they go the extra mile, but evidently determining the concentration of a key ingredient is beyond that mile.  Apologizing must be within that mile.  I give up.  At this point I hesitate to buy the product based on poor customer service from the vendor and non-disclosure from the manufacturer.  Are the ingredients even listed accurately?  Maybe Neuvaderm contains an insignificant amount of Argireline and who knows what else?  That is my justification for a 1-star rating:  I have no idea who makes the product or what it is.  For those die-hards who condemn my 1-star rating without trying the product, perhaps you should try to find out exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently Dr. Oz mentioned Argireline on his show, but many of the magic solutions he purports do not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  While I believe Dr. Oz is a brilliant heart surgeon, I&#x27;m not a blind Oziac follower.  To research a health product/device/procedure/drug/therapy, I recommend that consumers search for support in medical journals and not on Internet vendor sites, many of which are disguised as research sites.  I have access to all medical journals through my job, but consumers can read many journal abstracts of studies via online medical search engines.  Consumers have the right to know information on the safety and effectiveness of products they buy--including the percentage of key ingredients.  Until I get more info, I&#x27;m not buying Neuvaderm.g must be within that mile.  I give up.

            <li> It was very harsh on my skin.  I think there comes a time when you are better off not to try something new unless it comes local.  This was also way too expensive.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product for about a week, but nothing has improved so far. I will wait and see, but at this point this product is not any different from my usual product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I care for this stuff. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my face yet. But when you apply it. It makes me feel as if I am putting wax on my face. And I think whatever it is in this ingredient. It fills in the lines with this waxy stuff. Feels like I got a layer on. I didn&#x27;t care for it. Not to sound rash. But it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> It is a light cream and is good for sensitive skin that does not clog pores, would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was skeptical about this, but for the low price versus department store cosmetics, figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, it really works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, people were commenting that I looked less tired, asked if I had lost weight or been exercising.  Since it works gradually, you notice a bit of difference yourself, but the people who don&#x27;t see you that often really notice a dramatic change. Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t make a 69 year old look 20, but it definitely has taken off a decade of wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I have used several products trying to keep my face moisturized and my skin tone even.  It is very difficult for a woman in her 50&#x27;s to regain that youthful glow. A friend recommended Neuvaderm and I am hooked.  This stuff really works.  My face feels soo soft and my complexion has never looked better. I will never go back to the expensive mosturizes I used to use get.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout. It is annoying and wasteful to dump more than is necessary for one facial application into one&#x27;s hand. Can you have the manufacturer replace this vial ? It&#x27;s a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.</li>
            <li> Since the Skin Origins Eye Revival worked so well for my eyes  I decided to purchase the face cream since i have very dry skin. This cream came in the same unique silver bottle that looked very high end. The dispenser worked great so I am not sure why others have said it did not. The cream dispensed the exact amount of cream needed to cover the full face which was great. My skin felt really moisturized and re-freshed after using this cream a few times.</li>
            <li> I purchased Neuvaderm Rejuvenating Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle and Moisturizing Cream a short time ago and I&#x27;m already noticing the disappearance of fine lines.  This is a wonderful moisturizer for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous anti-aging moisturizers in the past, with little success. A friend recently told me about Neuvaderm and I&#x27;m elated with the results.  My skin feels incredible soft, since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone, men and women alike, and would definitely buy it again.  It&#x27;s worth the price and I gave it a 5 star rating.  You&#x27;ve nothing to lose with the purchase of Neuvaderm anti-aging moisturizer, except your fine lines and wrinkles.  Go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,</li>
            <li> Good moistureizer...that&#x27;s about it.  No evidence of any anti-aging properties as advertised.  I plan to stick with Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> Love the Neuvaderm cream from Skin Origins. Recommended to me by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin condition. Skin Origins products seem to be perfect for me. Neuvaderm cream went on nice and smooth and dried fast. Skin felt very moist and elastic afterwards. I love this since I no longer have to worry about break-outs!</li>
            <li> I have used Neuvaderm for about a month now. It moisturized my skin and did reduce the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to eleminate the expensive facial creams that I&#x27;ve used in the past. Most of them I found were not as effective as Neuvaderm. Neuvaderm cream goes on smooth and dries really easy. My skin has a wonderful silky feel after I use it. I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for the price and the result. I&#x27;m actually tempted to return the lotion and get my money back because the pump was so ineffective at actually getting the cream out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm is such a good lotion my skin loves it very light my skin looks so good!  Wrinkles are not as deep all around good product excellent price can&#x27;t beat it!  Going to order a second bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was an excellent product and I really liked the customer service. I am happy I purchased this item. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell if it works or not. It is nice feeling and seems to stay on for a long time. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Neuvaderm is nothing less than AMAZING!  I&#x27;ve tried countless designer label anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products costing hundreds of dollars and none of them produced the incredible results Neuvaderm has.  My co-workers and friends keep asking if I&#x27;ve \\&quot;had work done\\&quot;.  They say I look years younger and my skin has a \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot;.  Finally there is an anti-aging and anti-wrinkle  product that really works and produces visible results.  The other amazing thing is, it is only a fraction of the cost of all the designer name products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Terrific product but not a great container.  I was going to send it back, but found that I could take it apart and force the cream to the spout.</li>
            <li> Fills in fine lines and corrects overall dullness for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I use moisturizer over it for a just from the spa look.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this anti-aging cream but was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It does not moisturize my skin &amp; dispenser is lousy.</li>
            <li> See great improvement ,feels good going on to my fave.  only problem ,I have to leave bottle upside down because it does not pump well but it is worth the inconvenience would recommend it to anyone</li>
