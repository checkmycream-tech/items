            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>By the way, using a liquid for your brow its really awesome.</li>
            <li>Best eyeliner/smudge brush ever!!</li>
            <li>This brush was perfect!</li>
            <li>and it looks great!</li>
            <li>This brush applies it perfectly.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great angle brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for that.</li>
            <li>Product works great.</li>
            <li>These are nice brushes but not nicer than the MAC brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is just one of many of the Revlon premium collection.</li>
            <li>I love this collection</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>OMG I just love this product I would rate it</li>
            <li>so glad I found it</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this brush but it fell apart very quickly and is no longer used after 3 months</li>
            <li>This brush works perfectly for putting on a dark eyeshadow as eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;nt even find this brush on the Revlon site because it was&#x27;nt available.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I really like the smudging end of this tool.  </li>
            <li>great little brush by revlon</li>
            <li>This purchase is rare and completes my set.</li>
            <li>I knew what the little brush at the bottom was used for, but I do use the angle brush for applying my concealer under my eyebrows and it really works great.</li>
            <li>unless you want to drop huge coin on such a tiny brush, I sure don&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>It gives you real flexibility in creating the look you want!</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and they get the job done.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s working really well with this liquid.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this product is NOT intended, and cannot be used, for the new gel eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice too, but I do wonder how long the smudging end will last.  </li>
            <li>I am in no way affiliated with Revlon and this product was purchased with my own hard earned money.</li>
            <li>I really like how soft the bristles are and how they don&#x27;t fall out or break off.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my new aqua brow.</li>
            <li>And the round other end is a good one to do with gel liner.</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to handle, works like I expected, and is standing up to daily usage and rinsing without loss of bristles.  </li>
            <li>works well and lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li>The bobbi brown one, for example, this lil thick brush make it easier to make it close enough to your eye and thick enough to be smoky hot!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets about my purchase.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say for this product other than it does the job it is intended to do pretty well.</li>

            <li> Cause now you don&#x27;t have to worry that just a tiny little touch will ruin your makeup as long as the brow is the theme of it.</li>
            <li> I wet the tapered end, then apply the eyeshadow as eyeliner, then use the blunt end of the brush to smudge it a bit</li>
            <li> ,one side for applying eye shadow and the other for smudging it and smoothing it out.</li>
            <li> It is firm enough to do what I want without being so stiff</li>
            <li> They are small enoff to put it</li>
            <li> almost 10 years later they still are not the same :(</li>
            <li> I had overplucked my eyebrows in high school like an idiot...</li>
            <li> This is terrible brush to apply eyeliner with especially the thin side.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>

            <li> I am in no way affiliated with Revlon and this product was purchased with my own hard earned money. This brush is just one of many of the Revlon premium collection. This purchase is rare and completes my set. I could&#x27;nt even find this brush on the Revlon site because it was&#x27;nt available. These brushes are super soft and they get the job done. They are small enoff to put it im purse and I dont have to worry about breaking or damaging my MAC brushes. These are nice brushes but not nicer than the MAC brush. I love this collection and I have no regrets about my purchase. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have used it exclusively for my eye brows and I love it. I might buy another for shadow.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this brush but it fell apart very quickly and is no longer used after 3 months</li>
            <li> works well and lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new aqua brow. And it&#x27;s working really well with this liquid. By the way, using a liquid for your brow its really awesome. Cause now you don&#x27;t have to worry that just a tiny little touch will ruin your makeup as long as the brow is the theme of it. Especially for me, I use the brow to change with my different styles. And the round other end is a good one to do with gel liner. The bobbi brown one, for example, this lil thick brush make it easier to make it close enough to your eye and thick enough to be smoky hot!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG I just love this product I would rate it a five star is I knew what the little brush at the bottom was used for, but I do use the angle brush for applying my concealer under my eyebrows and it really works great. I will recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great angle brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to handle, works like I expected, and is standing up to daily usage and rinsing without loss of bristles.  It is firm enough to do what I want without being so stiff I feel like it&#x27;s ripping my eyelid off.</li>
            <li> This brush came in a plastic package and was delivered to me on time. I really like how soft the bristles are and how they don&#x27;t fall out or break off. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bought for wife she loves these brushes</li>
            <li> So far so good, I really like the smudging end of this tool.  The brush is nice too, but I do wonder how long the smudging end will last.  I use it for applying eye shadow under my lower eye lashes and smudging the eyeshadow for a softer look.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. This is terrible brush to apply eyeliner with especially the thin side.</li>
            <li> If you are using powdered eyeshadow, then this truly is the eye brush for you. It gives you real flexibility in creating the look you want! Be aware that this product is NOT intended, and cannot be used, for the new gel eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner/smudge brush ever!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the rounded end was rubber. My mistake as I dont like rubber tips for smudging. I prefer short, compact bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush was perfect! I had overplucked my eyebrows in high school like an idiot... almost 10 years later they still are not the same :( This brush is great for that.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly for putting on a dark eyeshadow as eyeliner.  I wet the tapered end, then apply the eyeshadow as eyeliner, then use the blunt end of the brush to smudge it a bit and it looks great!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say for this product other than it does the job it is intended to do pretty well. I like the look the shadow liner gives vs. gel or liquid. This brush applies it perfectly.</li>
            <li> great little brush by revlon it is two sided.,one side for applying eye shadow and the other for smudging it and smoothing it out. so glad I found it</li>
            <li> Product works great. Pretty good brush unless you want to drop huge coin on such a tiny brush, I sure don&#x27;t!  The only con to this was it arrived in a dusty sleeve although the brush inside was clean and unharmed.</li>
