            <li>Awesome!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best primer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one of the best skin products out there...</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make your skin perfect (unless your skin already is), but it will smoothen out your skin a lot.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>The product comes in a lightweight, attractive container.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for a great finish.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smashbox Photo Finish oil free primer is the best product ever created to make liquid or cream make up glide on flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>use the primer after serum, eye cream, and moisturizer before my Makeup Forever HD foundation, and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I also use Lancome Visonnaire in the evening, and my skin seems much better than it ever has, making it the perfect canvas for the smashbox primer.</li>
            <li>Does not make me break out which was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>This primer goes on silky smooth and makes the skin feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this primer because of it&#x27;s mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li>My skin looks glowing and feels so good with a velvety like finish.</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>I really do love it!</li>
            <li>but this primer is amazing.</li>
            <li>The finish is a really nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my complexion and while I do have really nice skin, I can definately see and feel a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I have beautiful skin when I have it on.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy to say, both products are wonderful, and give my skin a very natural looking finish.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it -</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and so i can no longer pump it out onto my hand but must screw off the top and dish it out using a q-tip.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Of course now that I love it, I am sure at some point, it will be discontinued, always happens to products I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer after reading so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, and was so happy that it didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it has made my morning routine stretch MUCH longer.  </li>
            <li>Smashbox oil free- is very light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use bare minerals warmth, just a touch, and I am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Works great and does not dry my face and it does reduce the fine lines.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, seems to settle in my fine lines, and tends to look cakey on me ( i am 46)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look perfect, covers lines and little imperfectons.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>B001M6TIA4 Smashbox HALO Hydrating Perfecting Powder &amp; Brush Set Light]]</li>
            <li>Have used Smashbox Photofinish primer for several months, helps my skin look flawless, sometimes I wear it with foundation, other times not...</li>
            <li>Within the first day of using it, I noticed that my foundation lasted throughout the entire day and that my foundation applied more smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with MAC and Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>Feels like silk on my skin, holds foundation in place all day, no problems at all as ain&#x27;t have super sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had my old container with a working pump</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it not only goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft, and it makes my face look completely even-toned and oil-free.</li>
            <li>I had tried different primers (Bare Escentuals Prime TIme, Korres Antiageing Primer, Revlon Photoready Primer, and Loreal Magic Lumi Primer) before trying Smashbox -- and I have to say</li>
            <li>No More far superior.</li>
            <li>I wear it under powder and it does make my whole look last much longer than if applied over moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My 62 year old skin glows but doesn&#x27;t look oily or greasy, I won&#x27;t ever be with out this product and \\&quot;live in fear\\&quot; that Smashbox may some day discontinue it.</li>
            <li>Before I got the primer, I would apply my daily moisturizer, and about 10 minutes later I would add a creamy compact on my face and a loose powder over top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old and can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t discovered something like this sooner.</li>
            <li>It is oil free and a silky blend of vitamins A and E, grape seed extract, and green tea.</li>
            <li>but as far as keeping my foundation on any longer it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li>This didin&#x27;t help it last too much longer</li>
            <li>Soft and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I basically have to apply this product directly out of the shower, then fix all my hair and eat breakfast, and THEN apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>Or worse, they will change the formula, just like Tom Ford changed my beloved Rive Gauche, Yves Saint Laurent, but one can always hope this product will remain the same.</li>
            <li>I use this first, then I apply Laura Mercier translucent loose powder.</li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentual foundation and silky powder.</li>
            <li>I only applied a small dot each on my forehead, cheeks, and chin, and it is more than enough to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to open and a small pea size portion will cover your entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>annoying but other than this inconvenience, it is a great product!</li>
            <li>but if you are a first time buyer and get a defective pump I&#x27;ve also found that when you take a paperclip and unbend it you can stick it through the tiny air hole in the bottom of the bottle to \\&quot;push up\\&quot; the little plastic piece to get the product closer to the pump</li>

            <li> I have skin that is neither oily nor dry.</li>
            <li> Also works well with my BareMinerals loose powder...</li>

            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> overpriced junk in a little bottle  that clogs up continuously and does  nothing for the skin other than make  </li>
            <li> Once I got the primer, I put on my moisturizer as usual, and after 10 minutes I applied the primer with a make up sponge, then put on my compact foundation, and then put the loose powder and all my other make up on as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used an orange stick to get every little bit of it out.</li>

            <li> I still received a glass pump bottle that I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near impossible to get all of the product out of these pumps.</li>
            <li> it look DULL.</li>
            <li> Primers are typically much to thick for me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try the &amp;#34;choice&amp;#34; mattifier and not impressed. Dr Brandt Pores No More far superior. Just this esthetician&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> This primer goes on silky smooth and makes the skin feel wonderful.  I wear it under powder and it does make my whole look last much longer than if applied over moisturizer. Does not make me break out which was a pleasant surprise.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pump.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! My skin has a tendency to get oily during the day, and sometimes my make up wipes off. I decided to try this primer because of it&#x27;s mostly good reviews. I absolutely love it - it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft, and it makes my face look completely even-toned and oil-free. I really feel like I have beautiful skin when I have it on. Before I got the primer, I would apply my daily moisturizer, and about 10 minutes later I would add a creamy compact on my face and a loose powder over top. My face would look so shiny by the end of the day. Once I got the primer, I put on my moisturizer as usual, and after 10 minutes I applied the primer with a make up sponge, then put on my compact foundation, and then put the loose powder and all my other make up on as usual. Since I&#x27;ve started this routine, all my make up is still on my face by the time my 8 hour work day is over. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product delivers and then some. I&#x27;m 41 years old and can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t discovered something like this sooner. By noon my makeup would be sliding off my face and creasing. This is a miracle and I wish I would have discovered it sooner. No longer do I need to carry all my makeup for touch ups. You put this on and at the end of the day my makeup looks like it did when I put it on in the morning. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the pump. Since it is airless I figured it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; the product in order to create the vaccum inside to get the product to come out. Luckily, I had my old container with a working pump and I made the simple swap and it was no biggie, but if you are a first time buyer and get a defective pump I&#x27;ve also found that when you take a paperclip and unbend it you can stick it through the tiny air hole in the bottom of the bottle to \\&quot;push up\\&quot; the little plastic piece to get the product closer to the pump so you can use it. I&#x27;ve also used an orange stick to get every little bit of it out. I LOVE this product. I get so many compliments on my complexion and while I do have really nice skin, I can definately see and feel a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I doubt your boyfriend or husband would notice though lol...</li>
            <li> Smashbox Photo Finish oil free primer is the best product ever created to make liquid or cream make up glide on flawlessly.  My 62 year old skin glows but doesn&#x27;t look oily or greasy, I won&#x27;t ever be with out this product and \\&quot;live in fear\\&quot; that Smashbox may some day discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I read about this product and decided to try it. i have a lot of trouble putting on foundation and fear the creasing. but this primer is amazing. it not only goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue but it does keep my foundation in place and prevents creases. i&#x27;d say this is a must, especially for those who don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. the only criticism i have for it is the packaging. the primer gets clogged in the filter and so i can no longer pump it out onto my hand but must screw off the top and dish it out using a q-tip. annoying but other than this inconvenience, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> overpriced junk in a little bottle  that clogs up continuously and does  nothing for the skin other than make  it look DULL. I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Feels like silk on my skin, holds foundation in place all day, no problems at all as ain&#x27;t have super sensitive skin!! Permanent staple in my make-up collection!!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product in a small bottle. The product comes in a lightweight, attractive container. It is easy to open and a small pea size portion will cover your entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for all skin types. I have skin that is neither oily nor dry. It applies smoothly and feels like silk. It makes my skin look perfect, covers lines and little imperfectons. I use Bare Escentual foundation and silky powder. My make-up stays the same the entire day. The makeup and brush seems to glide over my skin. It does feel like I have provided a canvas for my foundation. It is oil free and a silky blend of vitamins A and E, grape seed extract, and green tea. I often wear this alone over my moistureizer and don&#x27;t apply foundation. My skin looks glowing and feels so good with a velvety like finish. I use it at home even when I&#x27;m just putting on a touch of blush. Works great and does not dry my face and it does reduce the fine lines. It takes very little product to achieve. This is the best primer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-06-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004QS0E0S Smashbox Try It Kit (2 Value) Try It Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001M6TIA4 Smashbox HALO Hydrating Perfecting Powder &amp; Brush Set Light]]</li>
            <li> Have used Smashbox Photofinish primer for several months, helps my skin look flawless, sometimes I wear it with foundation, other times not... Hope they make it forever...one of the best skin products out there...</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1oz with air pump and it didn&#x27;t work!  Thankfully the seller accepted the return so I purchased the 1oz from the squeeze tub which works without a problem.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work but as far as keeping my foundation on any longer it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick. I have really oily skin and make up creases and comes off after a few hrs. This didin&#x27;t help it last too much longer I had better luck with MAC and Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I also like how it feels on your skin. Soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Primers are typically much to thick for me.  Smashbox oil free- is very light and smooth.  Also works well with my BareMinerals loose powder...</li>
            <li> Deja la piel libre de grasa y el maquillaje dura todo un día sin verse grasoso. Altamente recomendado para pieles grasas o pieles normales a ser maquilladas en una locación muy calurosa</li>
            <li> I purchased the Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer after reading so many rave reviews. I had tried different primers (Bare Escentuals Prime TIme, Korres Antiageing Primer, Revlon Photoready Primer, and Loreal Magic Lumi Primer) before trying Smashbox -- and I have to say, this is it! I will look no further!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the primer after serum, eye cream, and moisturizer before my Makeup Forever HD foundation, and this stuff is amazing! Within the first day of using it, I noticed that my foundation lasted throughout the entire day and that my foundation applied more smoothly on my skin. It won&#x27;t make your skin perfect (unless your skin already is), but it will smoothen out your skin a lot. The finish is a really nice matte finish. I also have sensitive skin, and was so happy that it didn&#x27;t make me break out. Also, a little goes a long way. I only applied a small dot each on my forehead, cheeks, and chin, and it is more than enough to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, seems to settle in my fine lines, and tends to look cakey on me ( i am 46) I purchased this product based on reviews. I really do love it! I use this first, then I apply Laura Mercier translucent loose powder. I have oily, acne prone skin, nothing serious, just annoying. So far I am happy to say, both products are wonderful, and give my skin a very natural looking finish. My skin shows through, and I never look over done. I use bare minerals warmth, just a touch, and I am quite happy with the results. I also use Lancome Visonnaire in the evening, and my skin seems much better than it ever has, making it the perfect canvas for the smashbox primer. Of course now that I love it, I am sure at some point, it will be discontinued, always happens to products I enjoy. Or worse, they will change the formula, just like Tom Ford changed my beloved Rive Gauche, Yves Saint Laurent, but one can always hope this product will remain the same.</li>
            <li> Smoothing, non-greasy, melts into the skin and keeps my powder foundation on all day. I recommend it for a great finish.</li>
            <li> Am I allergic to this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple act of applying it to my skin leaves my face red and blotchy (no itch).  It takes about 30 minutes for the blotchiness to diminish and my regular skin tone to re-appear.  But it DOES really work well under my usual makeup -- as for making me look \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, who can say?  But my makeup just glides on and stays on all day -- does not rub off on collars or anything.  This is a good product, but it has made my morning routine stretch MUCH longer.  I basically have to apply this product directly out of the shower, then fix all my hair and eat breakfast, and THEN apply makeup.  Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m mixed on Smashbox primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product but I feel deceived by the picture of the squeeze tube.  I still received a glass pump bottle that I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I ordered this thinking I was getting the primer in the picture.  It&#x27;s near impossible to get all of the product out of these pumps.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and makes your makeup glide on.  Great stuff.  I even use it when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup--your skin feels like baby skin.</li>
