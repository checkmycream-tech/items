            <li>If you are not looking to add sparkle to your eyes however, this may not be the best UD product for you.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome palette of eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>Perfect example would be that I had my eye on Shattered for months</li>
            <li>this is a great way to go!</li>
            <li>All the shades blend beautifully together.</li>
            <li>the colors are absolutely beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the copper tones, they are very sexy around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Very impressed &amp; will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li>This palette is great.</li>
            <li>I like the ammo box alot, it comes with alot of great colors with alot of variety.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is still a great deal, because you&#x27;re getting 10 shadows for $30 some bucks.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Depending on your taste, all of these colors would be great for a night out.  </li>
            <li>but with that said this is still my favorite palette!!</li>
            <li>I get more compliments when i wear these colors than i do with my mac shadows!!</li>
            <li>their very nice when blended.</li>
            <li>You get 10 great, popular UD colors for the price of 2!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been very adventurous with eye shadow colors until I bought this palette.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This palette is amazing.</li>
            <li>There is a nice variety of colors and</li>
            <li>Great deal, the colors are very rich and bright, mix well, and look unique.  </li>
            <li>All these colors are sold separately at a much higher price, and there is a very goodly amount of product in this palate.  </li>
            <li>Great pigments...and fun to wear.</li>
            <li>:   lasts a good while  colors are pretty  nice case--slim-line    cons:   </li>
            <li>i love this palette.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried on all the colors already and they look fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I</li>
            <li>I love to use Chopper and Smog together.</li>
            <li>I love the way my eyes look with those 2 colors.</li>
            <li>I love Sin, Chopper, Maui Wowie and Smog.</li>
            <li>I think its because some of these colors sparkle more than macs do.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>This palette contains many of the best sellers by Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>more eyeshadow applicators&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was in love with this palette for that reason, they took 10 colors and paired them together into 5 sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my makeup while wearing these shadows.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>Use with the eyeshadow primer and it will look flawless all day long.</li>
            <li>Colors on the whole are beautiful and true to the pressed color.</li>
            <li>colors don&#x27;t blend easily...</li>
            <li>do not break easily</li>
            <li>For example take the first two colors Smog (amazing for brown eyes) and</li>
            <li>I love all the colors, they have a high pigmentation to them, and this is also perfect for someone who&#x27;s never tried Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are top to bottom complimentary.</li>
            <li>I have bought this make-up palette 3 TIMES, that&#x27;s how fantastic it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have so many colors at your fingertips,</li>
            <li>so many options to do something fun, and</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended, particularly to those of us under 40 who still take joy in beauty.  </li>
            <li>It is very worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one in particular has a nice variety, either for work or play.</li>
            <li>These colors are so rich and blend so well on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>This palette is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to store, and it has a very cute design on the outside.</li>
            <li>If you find that you&#x27;ve applied more pigment than you like, just dab a cotton ball, makeup sponge or dry tissue across the eyelid to remove excess, then be sure to look at the rest of your face to make sure you don&#x27;t have glitter in places you don&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this may be the most fun I&#x27;ve had with any makeup purchase, I like it that much!  </li>
            <li>some packages come with a full size primer</li>
            <li>and they produce a lot of full out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been said that these colors can&#x27;t be worn to work, and in some cases this is true.  </li>
            <li>The colors look to be nice and wearable with almost anything, but if you like the natural look with some color then don&#x27;t purchase, if you like the \\&quot;eye popping\\</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Grifter\\&quot; is not bad either.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just too bold of colors for me...</li>
            <li>I am overall very pleased with this palette.</li>
            <li>the quality is just as good as MAC but Urban Decay offers cheaper costing palettes with more colors.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy and a lovely way to sample the different popular Urban Decay colors.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are very glittery and shimmery, and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not cutting on the shadow, I do like Sin and Chopper,</li>
            <li>I thought I would be through them pretty quickly</li>
            <li>You might try applying these shadows with a shadow brush rather than the enclosed applicator to get just the right amount of pigment.  </li>
            <li>Such excess glitter is most easily removed with a real (non-synthetic) cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in trying Urban Decay eyeshadow &amp; decided trying a little kit like this would be the best way.</li>
            <li>This is my first Urban Decay product and I love it.</li>
            <li>Buying the shadows individually would be much more.</li>
            <li>This was the first Urban Decay product I purchased, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used a combo that I didn&#x27;t like, and the colors are so pigmented that it doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li>However the reasons I am neglecting to deem it worthy of 5 stars are a) Shattered (the turquoise color and one of the main reasons I bought this)</li>
            <li>It shows up as more of a sheer wash than an eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I use it just about everyday and love to mix the colors for fun!        </li>
            <li>you are looking to try out the line, the brand, or it is your first high end purchase</li>
            <li>These are shimmery colors that really make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>gotta really work at it</li>
            <li>Some are very glittery and some aren&#x27;t, but you can create alot of looks with just a couple of the shadows.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t fork over $15 for it because it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li>it really makes your eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure how this product would work for me, but I am very pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>And of course it should go without saying that just because the colors are obviously paired to be worn together, you certainly don&#x27;t have to - have fun with it!  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and they blend very nicely.</li>
            <li>Normally I do not use urban decay but this shadow has amazing quality.  </li>
            <li>(Also alot of glittery fallout when applying so be sure to put down some powder)</li>
            <li>This is high quality eye shadow, people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glitter fall out it high</li>
            <li>Lighter more natural colors for casual wear &amp; deeper more vibrant colors for going out.</li>
            <li>The brand has exploded, and is now known for its wide ranging color palette, funky and daring color names (Mildew and Polyester Bride, for example) and commitment to quality, cruelty free makeup.</li>
            <li>Particularly well-known are Urban Decay&#x27;s eye shadows, all of which are densely pigmented and low on filler (resulting in shadows that don&#x27;t crease or easily wear off), and most of which are heavy on sparkle and shimmer.  </li>
            <li>The company was initially started by an alterna-chic woman who couldn&#x27;t find cosmetics in the fun, funky colors she wanted to wear.  </li>
            <li>This will last for awhile, and so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear these shadows I get tons of compliments, especially since it is so easy to blend multiple colors together.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular palette because I felt that it actually did have the most wearable colors out of the other palettes.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I really didn&#x27;t think it would appeal to me because the colors were so bold and out of my usual color options.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting to try a few of these shades for awhile but didn&#x27;t want to order them and the colors not look good on me, after I spent $15 on each.</li>
            <li>And to those to whom beauty has become nothing more than a tedious routine, this little slice of makeup heaven might re-awaken the teeanager in you, who loved to try new things.  </li>
            <li>It has both dark and light colors that last long and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This was my first venture into Urban Decay products.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye shadow palette that I have purchased from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Urban Decay brand and aesthetic, the first thing to know is that this is not a makeup line designed for or marketed toward soccer moms.  </li>
            <li>These colors are very highly pigmented making it longer lasting.</li>
            <li>(try Chanel)    5 out of the 10 of these shades are very glittery....not necessarily a con for some, but just know that....</li>
            <li>, it looks old but nothing but wear and tear of something i use every day.</li>
            <li>pretty!)I thought this was all in my head until I had my make-up done by a professional artist</li>
            <li>Finally, Last Call and Grifter are glittering purple shades, with Last Call being the darker of the two and although these are both red-based purples this is most obvious with Last Call.    </li>
            <li>UD&#x27;s shadows last without creasing all day on me even though I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The pigments are true and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are paired top to bottom to be matched two at a time: \\&quot;Chopper\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; for instance are both glittery pale peach and champagne colored respectively.  </li>
            <li>However I think Smog, Maui Wowie and Polyester Bride in particular are neutral enough and so lacking in large glitter as to be above reproach.</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily bad, and quite nice for an evening or dramatic look, just different from what I had expected.</li>
            <li>These are high quality eyeshadows and last .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very bold with my own selections, but not giving into my urge to reach for the usual shades, I&#x27;ve found to my delight that this set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Oil Slick is black with a high content of rainbow glitter, but its companion shade in the palette, Polyester Bride, is an intense white with more sparkle than glitter.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t evident from the pic or description    hard to believe how extremely cheaply made the applicator is...not what I expected from this brand.    </li>
            <li>I use Chopper and blend it all over my entier lid , and use Smog as a liner, since its pretty dark.</li>
            <li>Definately makes you feel like the money spent is worth it when you see how long they will last you.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who swears by Urban Decay shadows, and this palette in particular.</li>
            <li>Mildew and Shattered are likewise toned down when it comes to the glitter content, but I don&#x27;t find these two colors very wearable.</li>
            <li>Oil Slick, Mildew, and Shattered would be out for anyone not working at a coffee house, but Polyester Bride, Last Call and Grifter could fly in a casual office.  </li>

            <li> And of course it should go without saying that just because the colors are obviously paired to be worn together, you certainly don&#x27;t have to - have fun with it!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and they blend very nicely.</li>
            <li> Normally I do not use urban decay but this shadow has amazing quality.  </li>
            <li> (Also alot of glittery fallout when applying so be sure to put down some powder)</li>
            <li> This is high quality eye shadow, people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glitter fall out it high</li>
            <li> Lighter more natural colors for casual wear &amp; deeper more vibrant colors for going out.</li>
            <li> The brand has exploded, and is now known for its wide ranging color palette, funky and daring color names (Mildew and Polyester Bride, for example) and commitment to quality, cruelty free makeup.</li>
            <li> Particularly well-known are Urban Decay&#x27;s eye shadows, all of which are densely pigmented and low on filler (resulting in shadows that don&#x27;t crease or easily wear off), and most of which are heavy on sparkle and shimmer.  </li>
            <li> The company was initially started by an alterna-chic woman who couldn&#x27;t find cosmetics in the fun, funky colors she wanted to wear.  </li>
            <li> This will last for awhile, and so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear these shadows I get tons of compliments, especially since it is so easy to blend multiple colors together.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular palette because I felt that it actually did have the most wearable colors out of the other palettes.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I really didn&#x27;t think it would appeal to me because the colors were so bold and out of my usual color options.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try a few of these shades for awhile but didn&#x27;t want to order them and the colors not look good on me, after I spent $15 on each.</li>
            <li> And to those to whom beauty has become nothing more than a tedious routine, this little slice of makeup heaven might re-awaken the teeanager in you, who loved to try new things.  </li>
            <li> It has both dark and light colors that last long and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into Urban Decay products.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye shadow palette that I have purchased from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Urban Decay brand and aesthetic, the first thing to know is that this is not a makeup line designed for or marketed toward soccer moms.  </li>
            <li> These colors are very highly pigmented making it longer lasting.</li>
            <li> (try Chanel)    5 out of the 10 of these shades are very glittery....not necessarily a con for some, but just know that....</li>
            <li> , it looks old but nothing but wear and tear of something i use every day.</li>
            <li> pretty!)I thought this was all in my head until I had my make-up done by a professional artist</li>
            <li> Finally, Last Call and Grifter are glittering purple shades, with Last Call being the darker of the two and although these are both red-based purples this is most obvious with Last Call.    </li>
            <li> UD&#x27;s shadows last without creasing all day on me even though I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> The pigments are true and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are paired top to bottom to be matched two at a time: \\&quot;Chopper\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; for instance are both glittery pale peach and champagne colored respectively.  </li>
            <li> However I think Smog, Maui Wowie and Polyester Bride in particular are neutral enough and so lacking in large glitter as to be above reproach.</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily bad, and quite nice for an evening or dramatic look, just different from what I had expected.</li>
            <li> These are high quality eyeshadows and last .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very bold with my own selections, but not giving into my urge to reach for the usual shades, I&#x27;ve found to my delight that this set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oil Slick is black with a high content of rainbow glitter, but its companion shade in the palette, Polyester Bride, is an intense white with more sparkle than glitter.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t evident from the pic or description    hard to believe how extremely cheaply made the applicator is...not what I expected from this brand.    </li>
            <li> I use Chopper and blend it all over my entier lid , and use Smog as a liner, since its pretty dark.</li>
            <li> Definately makes you feel like the money spent is worth it when you see how long they will last you.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who swears by Urban Decay shadows, and this palette in particular.</li>
            <li> Mildew and Shattered are likewise toned down when it comes to the glitter content, but I don&#x27;t find these two colors very wearable.</li>
            <li> Oil Slick, Mildew, and Shattered would be out for anyone not working at a coffee house, but Polyester Bride, Last Call and Grifter could fly in a casual office.  </li>
            <li> Also, remember that these pigments are intense; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> one issue would be that not all of the colors are very wearable, i.e. mildew, oil slick and last call</li>
            <li> The amount of sparkle varies with the colors, but at least 6 out of ten have actual glitter in them while the others range from as glittery to very shimmering.</li>
            <li> I also use the black \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; shade with a liner brush in place of black eyeliner and it works very well!  </li>
            <li> (wet a flat, angled brush and use some shades as liner...</li>
            <li> One is that few people are going to wear all ten colors, and may in fact wear only four or six with regularity.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, this palette isn&#x27;t for everyone, and it does have a few detractors.  </li>
            <li> is not very well pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> the other way around).</li>
            <li> Also, I like using Polyester Bride the white shimmer all over my lid, and use Oil Slick to line and smudge.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the darker of the two, Chopper, on the mid and lower lid, with Sin on the brow bone.  </li>
            <li> some of their other kits it needs a primer in the kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re paired to compliment each other.  </li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are EXTREMELY glittery and shimmery.</li>
            <li> Chopper and Sin are also quite neutral, pale colors, and although they are glittery, as long as they are applied judiciously (without overloading the applicator)</li>
            <li> Housed in a thin black case with purple flocked velvet and gilding on the outside (depicting a revolver firing out swirls of smoke) are ten shades of shimmering and/or glittering, high-quality eye color.  </li>
            <li> I know that 3 is common, but I am simple and two works.</li>
            <li> so I broke down and purchased it.</li>
            <li> A few application tips: apply these shadows before any other makeup, even foundation, as the glitter from the shadow will sometimes drop onto the cheek during application or blending.  </li>
            <li> You can choose a lot of color or a little.</li>
            <li> A little can do a lot and there is no need to touch up.</li>
            <li> I tend to use 2 colors everyday to work</li>
            <li> After owning this for a few weeks you cannot tell it has been used.</li>
            <li> shadows don&#x27;t stay firm...</li>
            <li> I find \\&quot;Sin,\\&quot; \\&quot;Chopper,\\&quot; \\&quot;Smog\\&quot; and \\&quot;Maui Wowie\\&quot; all to be wearable, and I&#x27;ve used Polyester Bride a few times as well.</li>
            <li> I usually use this when I go out at night because it contains alot of glitter.</li>
            <li> it is hard to tell from the sample picture</li>
            <li> Also Oil Slick and Polyester Bride can be use to highlight or add a smokey effect any look!</li>
            <li> While the colors seemed a bit shocking at first, I&#x27;ve ended up using ALL of them.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve had mine for alost two years and it hasn&#x27;t broken or anything yet</li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The richness of pigment is insane.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this palette. i can wear it to class or to the club, it&#x27;s all about how u apply it. some packages come with a full size primer i would recommend buying that. the only con about these eye shadows is the glitter. i think there might be 4 or 5 glittery shadows and they produce a lot of full out. but with that said this is still my favorite palette!! the quality is just as good as MAC but Urban Decay offers cheaper costing palettes with more colors. with MAC a pre-made palette will only offer 4 to 6 colors for about $36-$40.</li>
            <li> This is my first Urban Decay product and I love it. I feel that all of the colors are wearable you just have to know how to blend. These are shimmery colors that really make your eyes pop. The make up stays put and I really enjoy this product. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying Urban Decay eyeshadow &amp; decided trying a little kit like this would be the best way. I am so glad I did. This one in particular has a nice variety, either for work or play. Lighter more natural colors for casual wear &amp; deeper more vibrant colors for going out. One thing I can say about these shadows are that they really last. I thought I would be through them pretty quickly but I&#x27;m not. I tend to use 2 colors everyday to work &amp; I have been using them for a couple months now &amp; not even close to running out. A little goes a long way and they blend very nicely. Definately makes you feel like the money spent is worth it when you see how long they will last you. Very impressed &amp; will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into Urban Decay products. I am overall very pleased with this palette. If you are not looking to add sparkle to your eyes however, this may not be the best UD product for you. The amount of sparkle varies with the colors, but at least 6 out of ten have actual glitter in them while the others range from as glittery to very shimmering. (Also alot of glittery fallout when applying so be sure to put down some powder) These colors are very highly pigmented making it longer lasting. After owning this for a few weeks you cannot tell it has been used. I use it just about everyday and love to mix the colors for fun!        PRO-TIP: The colors are top to bottom complimentary. For example take the first two colors Smog (amazing for brown eyes) and Maui Wowie. You could use MW for your lid and Smog for your crease(or the other way around). Same way with all the colors. Also Oil Slick and Polyester Bride can be use to highlight or add a smokey effect any look!</li>
            <li> This palette is great. You can choose a lot of color or a little. It has both dark and light colors that last long and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> pros:   lasts a good while  colors are pretty  nice case--slim-line    cons:   shadows don&#x27;t stay firm...too much powder released when stroked, causing product to be wasted.  (try Chanel)    5 out of the 10 of these shades are very glittery....not necessarily a con for some, but just know that....wasn&#x27;t evident from the pic or description    hard to believe how extremely cheaply made the applicator is...not what I expected from this brand.    colors don&#x27;t blend easily...gotta really work at it</li>
            <li> I like the ammo box alot, it comes with alot of great colors with alot of variety. Some are very glittery and some aren&#x27;t, but you can create alot of looks with just a couple of the shadows. Yes it comes in a cardboard box but i&#x27;ve had mine for alost two years and it hasn&#x27;t broken or anything yet, it looks old but nothing but wear and tear of something i use every day.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been very adventurous with eye shadow colors until I bought this palette. While the colors seemed a bit shocking at first, I&#x27;ve ended up using ALL of them. The pigments are true and last a long time. All the shades blend beautifully together.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I just received it in the mail today and can&#x27;t wait to start using it. I&#x27;ve tried on all the colors already and they look fabulous!</li>
            <li> My sister younger sister loves to borrow from this from me alot.I usually use this when I go out at night because it contains alot of glitter.I use  sin, maui wowie smog, last call! and mildew</li>
            <li> This is the first eye shadow palette that I have purchased from Urban Decay. I&#x27;ve been using their primer potion for a while now, but I&#x27;d never bought anything else from the company. I&#x27;d been wanting this for a while so I broke down and purchased it. I&#x27;m so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette itself is pretty small so it&#x27;s easy to store, and it has a very cute design on the outside. It comes with 10 colors, and the applicator (which I don&#x27;t use; I prefer brushes). Most of the colors are very glittery and shimmery, and they are very pigmented. This is high quality eye shadow, people. The shadows do not crease and they last all day even on oily lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue would be that not all of the colors are very wearable, i.e. mildew, oil slick and last call I don&#x27;t see myself doing anything with. That being said, this is still a great deal, because you&#x27;re getting 10 shadows for $30 some bucks. Buying the shadows individually would be much more. I bought this particular palette because I felt that it actually did have the most wearable colors out of the other palettes. I find \\&quot;Sin,\\&quot; \\&quot;Chopper,\\&quot; \\&quot;Smog\\&quot; and \\&quot;Maui Wowie\\&quot; all to be wearable, and I&#x27;ve used Polyester Bride a few times as well. \\&quot;Grifter\\&quot; is not bad either. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> All these colors are sold separately at a much higher price, and there is a very goodly amount of product in this palate.  Great deal, the colors are very rich and bright, mix well, and look unique.  I would suggest that you purchase the eyeshadow primer with this set, the colors themselves don&#x27;t budge (I have worn them all day without any fading,) but the colors that have glitter in them do tend to leak glitter around your eyes, which is one thing the primer potion prevents.</li>
            <li> I have bought this make-up palette 3 TIMES, that&#x27;s how fantastic it is. The richness of pigment is insane. One swipe thats all you need and eyes POP! (wet a flat, angled brush and use some shades as liner...oooo pretty!)I thought this was all in my head until I had my make-up done by a professional artist and she pulled this out of her bag! Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who swears by Urban Decay shadows, and this palette in particular.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome palette of eyeshadows! I love all the colors, they have a high pigmentation to them, and this is also perfect for someone who&#x27;s never tried Urban Decay. I love to use Chopper and Smog together. I use Chopper and blend it all over my entier lid , and use Smog as a liner, since its pretty dark. I love the way my eyes look with those 2 colors. Also, I like using Polyester Bride the white shimmer all over my lid, and use Oil Slick to line and smudge. These are high quality eyeshadows and last .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of Urban Decay eyeshadow! These colors are so rich and blend so well on your eyelids. I love Sin, Chopper, Maui Wowie and Smog. I&#x27;d been wanting to try a few of these shades for awhile but didn&#x27;t want to order them and the colors not look good on me, after I spent $15 on each. Perfect example would be that I had my eye on Shattered for months and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t fork over $15 for it because it&#x27;s not what I expected. This is a great deal. You get 10 great, popular UD colors for the price of 2! My only gripe is the glitter from a couple of the colors gets all over your upper cheeks if you don&#x27;t use a shadow primer.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I really didn&#x27;t think it would appeal to me because the colors were so bold and out of my usual color options.  When you mix and match, especially with the glitter it really makes your eyes pop.  I definitely recommend this palette to others.  Normally I do not use urban decay but this shadow has amazing quality.  A little can do a lot and there is no need to touch up. I especially love the copper tones, they are very sexy around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing. I get more compliments when i wear these colors than i do with my mac shadows!! I think its because some of these colors sparkle more than macs do. Great pigments...and fun to wear.</li>
            <li> ABOUT THE COMPANY:  For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Urban Decay brand and aesthetic, the first thing to know is that this is not a makeup line designed for or marketed toward soccer moms.  The company was initially started by an alterna-chic woman who couldn&#x27;t find cosmetics in the fun, funky colors she wanted to wear.  The brand has exploded, and is now known for its wide ranging color palette, funky and daring color names (Mildew and Polyester Bride, for example) and commitment to quality, cruelty free makeup. Particularly well-known are Urban Decay&#x27;s eye shadows, all of which are densely pigmented and low on filler (resulting in shadows that don&#x27;t crease or easily wear off), and most of which are heavy on sparkle and shimmer.  Recently Urban Decay has created a line of matte shadows, but none are contained within this eye palette.    ABOUT THIS PRODUCT - THE BASICS:  Housed in a thin black case with purple flocked velvet and gilding on the outside (depicting a revolver firing out swirls of smoke) are ten shades of shimmering and/or glittering, high-quality eye color.  The palette has a magnetic closure (which having been jostled around extensively in my cluttered handbag, has never opened by accident) and contains a generously sized mirror and a standard dual ended sponge shadow applicator.  The colors are paired top to bottom to be matched two at a time: \\&quot;Chopper\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; for instance are both glittery pale peach and champagne colored respectively.  I usually wear the darker of the two, Chopper, on the mid and lower lid, with Sin on the brow bone.  One could do likewise with Smog and Maui Wowie, which are deeper shimmering (but NOT GLITTERY) browns.  Mildew and Shattered are likewise toned down when it comes to the glitter content, but I don&#x27;t find these two colors very wearable. Oil Slick is black with a high content of rainbow glitter, but its companion shade in the palette, Polyester Bride, is an intense white with more sparkle than glitter.  Finally, Last Call and Grifter are glittering purple shades, with Last Call being the darker of the two and although these are both red-based purples this is most obvious with Last Call.    USAGE TIPS:  It&#x27;s been said that these colors can&#x27;t be worn to work, and in some cases this is true.  However I think Smog, Maui Wowie and Polyester Bride in particular are neutral enough and so lacking in large glitter as to be above reproach. Chopper and Sin are also quite neutral, pale colors, and although they are glittery, as long as they are applied judiciously (without overloading the applicator) they can be worn anywhere, day or night.  Oil Slick, Mildew, and Shattered would be out for anyone not working at a coffee house, but Polyester Bride, Last Call and Grifter could fly in a casual office.  Depending on your taste, all of these colors would be great for a night out.  If you&#x27;re not a night prowler, you could extend the usefulness of this palette with the added purcase of Urban Decay Eye Shadow Transforming Potion, which turns any eyeshadow into a liquid liner. And of course it should go without saying that just because the colors are obviously paired to be worn together, you certainly don&#x27;t have to - have fun with it!  A few application tips: apply these shadows before any other makeup, even foundation, as the glitter from the shadow will sometimes drop onto the cheek during application or blending.  Such excess glitter is most easily removed with a real (non-synthetic) cotton ball.  Also, remember that these pigments are intense; a little goes a long way.  You might try applying these shadows with a shadow brush rather than the enclosed applicator to get just the right amount of pigment.  If you find that you&#x27;ve applied more pigment than you like, just dab a cotton ball, makeup sponge or dry tissue across the eyelid to remove excess, then be sure to look at the rest of your face to make sure you don&#x27;t have glitter in places you don&#x27;t want it.  This is not a difficultproduct to use at all.    TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY, THAT IS THE QUESTION...:  Obviously, this palette isn&#x27;t for everyone, and it does have a few detractors.  One is that few people are going to wear all ten colors, and may in fact wear only four or six with regularity.  Another pitfall is that the shadow applicator only has four sides, which can cause you to \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; the colors in the palette, or mix them on your lids.  Nonetheless, I give this five stars.  This was the first Urban Decay product I purchased, and I absolutely love it.  In fact, this may be the most fun I&#x27;ve had with any makeup purchase, I like it that much!  It&#x27;s fun to have so many colors at your fingertips, so many options to do something fun, and the colors are absolutely beautiful.  Very highly recommended, particularly to those of us under 40 who still take joy in beauty.  And to those to whom beauty has become nothing more than a tedious routine, this little slice of makeup heaven might re-awaken the teeanager in you, who loved to try new things.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The colors look to be nice and wearable with almost anything, but if you like the natural look with some color then don&#x27;t purchase, if you like the \\&quot;eye popping\\&quot; look then go for it, it&#x27;s just too bold of colors for me...I&#x27;m not cutting on the shadow, I do like Sin and Chopper, their very nice when blended.</li>
            <li> This palette contains many of the best sellers by Urban Decay.  It is very worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Great Shades&lt;br /&gt;Pigmented&lt;br /&gt;Good Price&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Smooth Texture&lt;br /&gt;Shadows do not break easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Need more eyeshadow applicators&lt;br /&gt;Glitter fall out it high&lt;br /&gt;Like some of their other kits it needs a primer in the kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try out the line, the brand, or it is your first high end purchase this is a great way to go!</li>
            <li> I am a two shadow using shader. I know that 3 is common, but I am simple and two works. I was in love with this palette for that reason, they took 10 colors and paired them together into 5 sets. I&#x27;m not very bold with my own selections, but not giving into my urge to reach for the usual shades, I&#x27;ve found to my delight that this set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used a combo that I didn&#x27;t like, and the colors are so pigmented that it doesn&#x27;t take much! This will last for awhile, and so worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette for almost a year now and it&#x27;s one of the palettes that I keep going back to.  There is a nice variety of colors and I like that they&#x27;re paired to compliment each other.  UD&#x27;s shadows last without creasing all day on me even though I have very oily skin.  I have blue eyes and all of the shades bring out the blue. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my makeup while wearing these shadows.  I also use the black \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; shade with a liner brush in place of black eyeliner and it works very well!  This palette is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I was not sure how this product would work for me, but I am very pleased with the outcome.  It was recommended by a salesperson at Sephora.      I use the darker colors as eyeliner, and the neutral colors as accents.  The color lasts all day.  I have gotten tons of compliments since I started wearing this palette.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear these shadows I get tons of compliments, especially since it is so easy to blend multiple colors together. Use with the eyeshadow primer and it will look flawless all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this with Christmas money as a gift for myself. I have to say I am extremely pleased. Colors on the whole are beautiful and true to the pressed color. However the reasons I am neglecting to deem it worthy of 5 stars are a) Shattered (the turquoise color and one of the main reasons I bought this) is not very well pigmented at all. It shows up as more of a sheer wash than an eyeshadow. And b) These eyeshadows are EXTREMELY glittery and shimmery. it is hard to tell from the sample picture but these colors are about 60% glitter or shimmer. This is not necessarily bad, and quite nice for an evening or dramatic look, just different from what I had expected. Overall a great buy and a lovely way to sample the different popular Urban Decay colors.</li>
