            <li>I had to find some more.</li>

            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it, but the smell wasn&#x27;t that strong as I have hope for.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap that lasts a long time and smells good.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is a good one to get.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film and it does make my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>When you think about how quickly that cheap, toxic bar of dial disappears, this soap is a bargain</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It will make your skin smell nice, soft, and just having the soap in the tub makes the bathroom fresher.</li>
            <li>Scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea salt is very good for the skin, a natural exfoliant but a very mild one.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the smell is incredibly nice.  </li>
            <li>It does not get too soft too fast and the lather is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, still manly enough and lasts unlike corporate chemical whipped with air soaps.</li>
            <li>Great smelling, large bars last a long time.</li>
            <li>It sells good and can last much longer than those big brand soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as exfoliating as other exfoliating soaps I have used, but it lasts considerably longer than those, and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>This soap is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>The soap is gentle on the skin and does not seem to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li>Thought it was really</li>
            <li>AND it smells so natural and fresh.</li>
            <li>this soap is VERY emollient.</li>
            <li>This really is what lemon verbena smells like.  </li>
            <li>And the cost per ounce is quite reasonable given the quality of the soap.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the lavender and rose Dead Sea Mineral Soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT if you want something that has a little more of a Lemony Kick, you might want to check out this</li>
            <li>I love this soap/ poor mans water softener / invigorating and gets you literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>one huge long lasting bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what the true merits of dead sea salt are, but this product is all around an A+ as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>The verbena flavor is just a little less fragrant than for \\&quot;L&#x27;Occitane\\&quot; product, but there is a huge price difference.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Review of Lemon Sage Dead Sea Soap. It is a good soap that lasts a long time and smells good. I enjoy using it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film and it does make my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing quite like lathering up with a citrus soap in the morning when you&#x27;re trying to wake up. This is such a fragrant soap-lemon verbena is one of those aromatherapy scents that invigorates you and elevates your mood and after trying all the One With Nature soaps, I like this one the best. It&#x27;s such a big bar, too, it produces a lot of lather, and it lasts a long time. Dead Sea salt is very good for the skin, a natural exfoliant but a very mild one. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve used this soap every day for years and never had a problem. The soap also contains glycerin, which pulls moisture from the air into the skin. This soap is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  The scent of lemon verbena fills the entire bathroom!  Soap is very nice - lathers well.    I also purchased the lavender and rose Dead Sea Mineral Soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The verbena flavor is just a little less fragrant than for \\&quot;L&#x27;Occitane\\&quot; product, but there is a huge price difference. The soap is gentle on the skin and does not seem to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Initially, all I was looking for was a soap that did not include any animal ingredients and was not tested on animals. I looked around for some time until I discovered this soap. It smells great. And now I&#x27;m addicted. That&#x27;s why I buy packs of six.</li>
            <li> Getting away from all of the chemical stuff that touches my body - Landry detergent, deodorant, soap, moisturizers and the like - due to my skin sensitivity and susceptibility to breaking out in rashes with chemical-laden products.  I&#x27;ve reordered this product three times now. Great smell, still manly enough and lasts unlike corporate chemical whipped with air soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap/ poor mans water softener / invigorating and gets you literally squeaky clean. Scent is fresh and clean. Nothing overpowering. I occasionally also use as a shampoo because my head gets jealous. It leaves my hair feeling fuller but gives me fly away hairs and static. I am hooked. If you have hard water in your area, I bet you will be too. Ultimately, it  keeps my dermatitis prone skin improved from the scales and itching I had before using. FYI  7 ounces and the biggest bar of soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me some of this for Christmas. I had to find some more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, have used for years now. For some reason it&#x27;s getting harder to find; hope it&#x27;s not going away anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film like some soaps. Great smelling, large bars last a long time. Love this!!!</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot. Thought it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;The bars of soap are definitely long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you want something that has a little more of a Lemony Kick, you might want to check out this&lt;br /&gt;other soap on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Michel Design Works Over-size Scented Triple-milled Bath Soap Bar, Lemon Basil, 8.7-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Its one huge long lasting bar of soap. And Its lemon aroma will fill the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Michel-Design-Works-Over-size-Triple-milled/dp/B003LYB7X6/ref&#x3D;pd_ys_sf_s_rp_a1_2_p?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1BTPMAH9E1HJ1Q7YH7Z3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice is search around on amazon, different sellers different prices.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It smells so good; especially if you like lemon grass smell you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A soothing lemony experience in bathing soap. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry especially in the dry winter season months!</li>
            <li> It sells good and can last much longer than those big brand soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice, smells good but not too strong, not chemically at all. Each bar lasts fairly long. It&#x27;s not quite as exfoliating as other exfoliating soaps I have used, but it lasts considerably longer than those, and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I get an average of two months (one user) out of each bar. When you think about how quickly that cheap, toxic bar of dial disappears, this soap is a bargain AND it&#x27;s not toxic AND it smells so natural and fresh.</li>
            <li> These soaps are the best ever! They feel great, they have a nice scent and they last a long time. I love them!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is a good one to get. It will make your skin smell nice, soft, and just having the soap in the tub makes the bathroom fresher.</li>
            <li> this soap is VERY emollient. I rub it into a scrubby and it makes a ton of suds. Leaves my skin silky soft. I love it. I give it as gifts with a scrubby, too.</li>
            <li> I love it, but the smell wasn&#x27;t that strong as I have hope for. It does the job as I have expected from it. It cleans and I didn&#x27;t have lots of blackheads or pimple after I use with this soap. Keep that in mind I eat primal/paleo.</li>
            <li> delicious smell, wonderful product. can&#x27;t beat the price for a long-lasting bar of soap. I will continue to buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap will leave your skin silky and also fresh sent.👍</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the soaps from one with nature!!! They smell delicious and feel really good on the skin. I Definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made my own soap, I&#x27;ve tried a hundred brands, always looking for soap that I will want to continue using.  I might have found it.  First the size impressed me.  I like a larger bar.  This one is 7 whopping ounces.  Secondly, the smell is incredibly nice.  This really is what lemon verbena smells like.  And, this is a very good quality soap.  It does not get too soft too fast and the lather is quite nice.  I have no idea what the true merits of dead sea salt are, but this product is all around an A+ as far as I am concerned.  And the cost per ounce is quite reasonable given the quality of the soap.</li>
            <li> This is great smelling lemony soap with plenty of plush lather. Perfect bath soap for lemon lovers, and they are good sized bars.</li>
