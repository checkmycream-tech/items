            <li> This is the best smelling product line Bath and Body works has EVER had! I don&#x27;t know why the killed it. I order it for my wife whenever I can find it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I received A bottle of Sugar &amp; Fig Pleasures as a Christmas Gift and was convinced within a few days that it was the best hand lotion I had ever used for a number of reasons. The fragrance alone was alluring, and what it did for the texture of my hands was amazing. It also helped with the health and look of my finger nails. I now buy it for myself as well as my friends. It&#x27;s a win win either as a gift or product to pamper yourself with.</li>
            <li> I love the Sugar &amp; Fig Pleasures fragrance it is so clean smelling and everytime I wear it someone says something about how good it smells.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores due to them only carrying it during Holidays or something so i had to have it since i ran out of my other and I wasn&#x27;t going to wait until they got it in the stores.  I even ordered it for my bestfriend since she always asked about it.  OH! and Fast delivery very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Love this gentle aroma!</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this scent , its so lovely. Ive gotten so many compliments on it. I feel the price was a little high seeing that the last bottle i got from the actual store was 50% off because the store is no longer carrying it BUT it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Classic to this day! I continue to wear this lotion daily!</li>
            <li> I loved getting these discontinued products.  Thank you for the fast service.  The packing was great and the products reached me much quicker than I expected them.  Thank you, again.</li>
            <li> Product is NOT authentic. Product is fabricated.... was not happy with product &amp; no refund. Product can open &amp; was advertised as new.</li>
            <li> I will order this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Cant buy this from Bath and Body and more. They do not sell this fragrance and is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I love sugar and Figure Pleasures fragrance is that it smells so clean and every time I get someone says something about how good it smells. I could not find in stores because they only take her on holidays or something so I had to have it because I ran out of my other and I was not going to wait until they got in store. I even asked for my best friend always asked about it. OH! fast delivery and very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of fig and this wasn&#x27;t all I&#x27;d hoped for. It smells nice, but far more sugary and not that many fig notes. The lotion itself is a nice quality, sinks in nicely and moisturizers ok.  Just wanted fig and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I really love this body lotion.  It has a sweet vanilla sugar scent and the fig makes a nice twist to it!&lt;br /&gt;The price was comparable to other stores and I would order this again.  I love a light scent for the&lt;br /&gt;hot summer so I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;I would refer a friend to buy this item.  Quick shipping and nicely wrapped/in bubble pack for&lt;br /&gt;safety.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION.  IT SMELLS SO AWESOME!!!  I WILL BUY THS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  I MUST HAVE IT ON HAND AT ALL TIMES.</li>
            <li> Picture shown is old bottle.  That is the one I wanted but instead, I got the new bottle- that I do not like!</li>
            <li> This lotion smelled so good that I am only wearing it on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lovely and sweet. I am thinking of getting the shower gel from Bath and Body works if I can find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the speedy shipping and for packaging my item so well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife is been buying this one for years and she loves it, we where looking for it on stores for a long time until finally we found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and this just smells sooooo good!! This is my go to scent during the winter months to keep skin smelling good and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I did receive the product on time, however, When I received my bottle of lotion it was a mess in a zip lock bag with lotion all over the cap and inside the ziplock bag.  It wasn&#x27;t closed tight and there was no tab to take off the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The product I was purchasing said &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; item.&lt;br /&gt;It did not smell like the lotion I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend. .</li>
            <li> I just received it last night. I ordered it on Tuesday late afternoon, and got it the next day. Great fast shipping!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK now let&#x27;s talk about the lotion - brown suger and fig body lotion. The scent is pleasant, I like it. I just wish it was lighter and more subtle, not as strong as it is. I know bath and body works makes all their creams with very strong scent, which I don&#x27;t like and that&#x27;s why I almost never buy their stuff! I don&#x27;t even want to go into the store! The smell is just too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, fig is my favorite fruit, I have a fig perfume from PIXI, which I absolutely adore! I searched for a fig lotion and found this one. While my husband completely hates the smell, I kinda like it. More importantly, the lotion feels soooooooo smooth on your skin, it absorbs instantly and leaves your skin glow... it leaves your skin feeling so good, it&#x27;s hard to explain. I can definitely see the difference between this lotion and some other body lotions I have. This one is velvet.. luxurious... I already have very nice, fine, and smooth skin, and this lotion just makes my skin absolutely feels like a baby skin. 5 stars period.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001OJFZ4M Bath &amp; Body Works Brown Sugar &amp; Fig Pleasures Collection Body Lotion 8 oz]] I love bath and body works and the lotion and gels smell great.It come in various fragrances. This is my recommendation that everyone try these fabulous products you will love them too. Please purchase it you will be pleased with your orders.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  She loved it.  And I loved all aspects of the customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, again.</li>
