            <li>I have loved these files for decades.</li>
            <li>Love them and they work great.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Although these are the KISS brand, they cannot even begin to compare with the washable kind.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when my daughter found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and it was still able to do a nice job.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best nail files!!!  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite nail files.</li>
            <li>I love this file and found them at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this file and have used nothing else since finding them.</li>
            <li>I was actually shopping for the KISS brand of WASHABLE Nail Files....which are AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>, I immediately bought 2 more packages :)</li>
            <li>I have been unsatisfied with most over the years, but these are comfortable and hold-up well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>These fall apart and seem like cheap junk, to me.  </li>
            <li>Best files ever, but hard to find.  </li>
            <li>There is puffy separation between them, it&#x27;s got nice action</li>
            <li>These are my favorite &amp; they seem not to be able to find these in the local stores any longer.</li>
            <li>I was THRILLED to finally find them here.</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking!</li>
            <li>I ordered them and they were exactly the ones I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>I used them for many years, and then all of a sudden</li>
            <li>They do such a great job on my nails, and each one has a very long life.</li>
            <li>I just use the file on the nail that has grown out rather than the whole nail.</li>
            <li>There is a smoothness to the Kiss file making my nails so much nicer than course files</li>
            <li>and you can angle the file really well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these highly.</li>
            <li>I thought these were normal boards.</li>
            <li>So I feel good having a small stack of brand new ones that will last me a long time, but I still hope they don&#x27;t stop making them.  </li>
            <li>gives the file a maneuverability that no stiff nail files can provide.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you need to tuck one of them in a small pocket or compartment in your purse, you can easily cut these in half with any scissors to make them fit.</li>
            <li>and I like the feel of the soft thickness.  </li>
            <li>It helps to give me a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>In fact, for several years when I couldn&#x27;t find new ones, I used my same old one over and over</li>
            <li>I missed the fine print that might have said they are those strange nearly half-inch thick</li>
            <li>These are so far above in quality from what the big box stores are promoting as look-alikes!</li>
            <li>that make it impossible to get a good edge.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on delicate nails and sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> Not what I need at all...way too harsh. How do I return them? Thanks for asking!</li>
            <li> I love these!! I can&#x27;t say enough- they are the best ever. I&#x27;ve used them for years, then couldn&#x27;t find them in stores any longer. I was THRILLED to finally find them here. They do such a great job on my nails, and each one has a very long life. In fact, for several years when I couldn&#x27;t find new ones, I used my same old one over and over and it was still able to do a nice job. I recommend these highly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. Love them and they work great. Hope they keep on making them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these around the house, then went to replace them and couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the local drugstores, CVS, Riteaide, Walgreens, Walmart, none of them carried Kiss nail files. So I tried others but didn&#x27;t like the feel of any of them comparatively. The two sides are the perfect grain and I like the feel of the soft thickness.  So I feel good having a small stack of brand new ones that will last me a long time, but I still hope they don&#x27;t stop making them.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product and they arrived quickly and were individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, just not what I expected.  I thought from the description that it was also a polisher.  My mistake.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones I previously purchased at Walgreen&#x27;s but they no longer carry them.  Love them!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite nail files. As I have aged my fingernails have developed slight ridges and this board allows me to file my nails and to even my nails out. When evening the nails out  When evening the nails out I just use the file on the nail that has grown out rather than the whole nail.</li>
            <li> These work wonderful with the acrylic nail kits, nice large size and the roughness is perfect for the imperfections in the finish of the acrylic nails</li>
            <li> These are my favorite &amp; they seem not to be able to find these in the local stores any longer.</li>
            <li> Kiss makes the best nail file ever. There is a smoothness to the Kiss file making my nails so much nicer than course files and they hold up for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I used these for years, but they suddenly disappeared from store shelves.  The two sides provide just the capabilities I need - filing and smoothing, and the foam pad separating them gives the file a maneuverability that no stiff nail files can provide.  Also, if you need to tuck one of them in a small pocket or compartment in your purse, you can easily cut these in half with any scissors to make them fit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kiss Nail file All Purpose File &amp; Smoother for a number of years.  It is gentle on delicate nails and sensitive skin.  I also like the Smoother side.  It helps to give me a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this file and found them at Walgreen&#x27;s.  I was never sure when they would have them in stock so if I found them I bought several.  Then they stopped carrying them not that i haven&#x27;t looked wherever I shopped.  Kiss website said all chain stores carried them.  Not so.  Then I was checking Amazon and there they seemed to be.  I ordered them and they were exactly the ones I had been looking for. Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Best files ever, but hard to find.  Stock up!</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files I have found.  I have been unsatisfied with most over the years, but these are comfortable and hold-up well.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find this product, again. They are the best nail files I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail file and it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores....  A rougher side for shaping and a softer side for buffing.</li>
            <li> I have loved these files for decades. Lately they have been impossible to find so I bought substitutes that looked similar. These are so far above in quality from what the big box stores are promoting as look-alikes! The pink layer does not gum up and lasts for months. The black layer files and the pink layer smoothes and buffs. Once I found this brand again I purchased 24 immediately........and these should last me another decade! Buy a 6 pack at least.</li>
            <li> These are the best files I have ever found!!  My local stores stop carrying them, so I got on line and found them.  Made me very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I thought these were normal boards. I missed the fine print that might have said they are those strange nearly half-inch thick blocks-- that have two layers of squishy foam(!) that make it impossible to get a good edge. Perhaps I just don&#x27;t understand the purpose behind this product. Wasted my money on these. Just found the correct Kiss boards that have the four grit sections and are thin enough to get under short nails.</li>
            <li> One side is gray, grit (but not too gritty) file and the other side is pink smoother.  There is puffy separation between them, it&#x27;s got nice action and you can angle the file really well.  I LOVE this file and have used nothing else since finding them. Pack of 6 at this price is a steal!</li>
            <li> I was actually shopping for the KISS brand of WASHABLE Nail Files....which are AWESOME!  Although these are the KISS brand, they cannot even begin to compare with the washable kind.  These fall apart and seem like cheap junk, to me.  Will not purchase them again.  As for the Seller, no problems.  Packaged well.  Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best nail files!!!  I used them for many years, and then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores or online.  I was thrilled when my daughter found them on Amazon.  When she got her order and I realized they were in fact the same files I used for years, I immediately bought 2 more packages :)</li>
