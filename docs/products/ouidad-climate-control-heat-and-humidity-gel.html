            <li>This is a great hair product.</li>
            <li>Like I said If I hadn&#x27;t seen the stylist do this with my own eyes and see the wonderful results I would have NEVER applied the gel like this.    </li>
            <li>Climate Control is a great gel for me.  </li>
            <li>Climate Control is a great gel for me.  </li>
            <li>, she told me to use this product for summer and that in the winter, when the humidity goes away, I can switch to the Curl Quencher line which is great for dryer climates.</li>
            <li>I bought this gel even though it is way overpriced because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>this product is great for controlling my frizz compared to this company moisturizing curl quencher gel.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I like to use it in tandem with the Ouidad Shine serum -- great combination.</li>
            <li>Great hair days every time I use it...</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great in the Wisconsin summer months.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for curly haired people livening in Florida..keeps the frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crispy.&amp;#34; When I&#x27;m staying indoors, I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
            <li>On outdoors, when I went tourist exploring on vacation in Vegas heat, I was still happy with results.</li>
            <li>I just keep looking in the mirror throughout the day, (even in the bathroom at work, lol)</li>
            <li>Works great on me and my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>If you want great looking curls</li>

            <li>This is a great product, I would recommend it for anyone who has problems with frizz</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d just pass on buying any; boy, am I glad I decided to revisit the idea!!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>and I am still in love with this product and very happy with the way the work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to duplicate the awesome curls every time doing it the way my stylist showed me.</li>
            <li>Great detangled and smells good too</li>
            <li>I find that it isn&#x27;t a good stand alone gel, as it doesn&#x27;t give me the definition I like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good gel.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find another conditioner that gave me good results</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find another conditioner that gave me good results</li>
            <li>My curls never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>is a good product</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair, and have always struggled between the frizzy, wild-woman look with no product, vs. the crunchy, wet-look of gels and mousse.  </li>
            <li>LOVED ALL THE QUIDAD PRODUCTS, BUT COULD NOT AFFORD THEM.  </li>
            <li>Good value and didn&#x27;t have to drive to the store to get it.</li>
            <li>really loved the consistency of this gel</li>
            <li>However it is still good when I don&#x27;t have time to do curlers etc.</li>
            <li>so this product is good when I can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>re-do every day, as I cannot use a curling brush with good effect after using the stuff.</li>
            <li>to bouncy, shiny, and just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>When my hair dries my waves stay smooth and my hair looks great all day! ...</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this from birchbox.com and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Really good for styling and humid conditions.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with curly hair appreciates it when someone recommends a product that actually is good, I&#x27;m spreading the love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have pretty curly hair and like to wear it curly, so i&#x27;m always on the prowl for the perfect curl product.</li>
            <li>and now Im in love!  </li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>awesome for curly hair, arrived fast!</li>
            <li>Love the way it calms frizz and makes styling curly hair easier!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I know lots of people love this stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly type 3 a (S pattern) and this gel really helped define my curls !!!!!</li>
            <li>This gel is light but gives my curls a great hold that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>this is an amazing product u work in sections</li>
            <li>For someone that has very curly hair that frizzes in the rain or humidity, this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make it crunchy, which i liked, but it just made it WAY too curly.</li>
            <li>, i purchased it, but i much rather prefer products like Aquage curl cream, which is the best product i&#x27;ve found for my curly hair to date (they have this on Amazon as well if you&#x27;d like to check it out).</li>
            <li>When I use the Ouidad on its own, I tend to get stringlets</li>
            <li>Its absolute perfection: no frizz, perfectly defined curls, and my hair doesnt puff up after a day.</li>
            <li>I will be honest.</li>
            <li>This product is OK but not as good as its sister product, Botanical Boost.</li>
            <li>I was impressed on how fast I received it.</li>
            <li>Climate Control is awesome and buying it through Amazon is much faster than their the company&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best product ever made for curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>but it is not as great as I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for curly hair and high humidity areas.</li>
            <li>great for super frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I love this product and plan on buying more!</li>
            <li>Great for hot humid summer weather!</li>
            <li>This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far for controlling my usually-uncontrollable curly hair.</li>
            <li>Using this product protects my hair from the heat of my blow dryer and leaves it with a nice healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>This is far the best climate control product for my hear that I ever had.</li>
            <li>I have tried practically every product I can get my hands on and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years directly from Ouidad, it&#x27;s always been great, and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I recently experienced Ouidad for the first time at my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Works great on my frizzy, fine hair, even on hot and humid days!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love my hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t applied like gel at all more like conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It really eliminates frizz, isn&#x27;t too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  </li>
            <li>It really eliminates frizz, isn&#x27;t too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it one more chance and this has slip and held my curls.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The stylist used a method called rake and shake which separated each curl and gave me a Shirley temple look (which I wasn&#x27;t in love with as a woman over 40)</li>
            <li>Oh and one more thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been out most of the morning</li>
            <li>Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz..</li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>Does what it says, feels light and keeps the frizz at bay!  </li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>this is light weight and feels like you have nothing in your hair!</li>
            <li>You have to use so much and the results aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>My hair looked ok</li>
            <li>And trust me I have tried many, many products on the market.</li>
            <li>However, I still needed to use another product with it to ensure a stronger hold as I have some curls that become more like waves by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>more intact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product - its my favorite curly hair product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I love the ouidad line</li>
            <li>you may have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>more is more.</li>
            <li>you have a crunch problem with this product, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Just comment! :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not only did my hair not frizz, but my hair was so beautifully defined!</li>
            <li>Ouidad is my favorite hair care line ever.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years and would never be caught without it.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Un-freakin&#x27;-believable.</li>

            <li>Now manipulate your curls till you&#x27;re satisfied with the way they look...</li>
            <li>I love buying Ouidad products from Amazon as I know I am getting what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair is in the j-lo territory if j-lo didn&#x27;t have the funds to have her hair perfectly blownout on a daily basis!!  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I still use this stuff on days I want to shower and airdry and know that my hair will look OK.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;).  </li>
            <li>as noted previously, i love the product and the experience, ordering, shipment and charging went without flaws.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, the more you handle them</li>

            <li>And i am sure yours will too :)</li>
            <li>I am finally able to stop searching.</li>

            <li>and it does a great job of controlling my summer high humidity</li>
            <li>My curls were PERFECT ringlets and super soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This particular product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found for hot, humid summer days.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that if you need to reactivate this gel, you don&#x27;t have to add more, you just have to wet your hair just a bit</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I thought this gel would be fine for me.</li>
            <li>Very cool product for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair, so at the end of blow drying my hair, when it&#x27;s still a bit damp, I run some of the Ouidad through my hair and it makes it more smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair stays frizz free even on the most humid of days.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product to keep the curls soft.</li>
            <li>The product was processed and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>My fine hair frizzes so easily in the Georgia heat.</li>
            <li>I still had a headful of beautiful curls the next day after dancing, drinking and sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Hands down - this is the best hair gel I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li>I live in Savannah so the product gets put through the ringer fairly often.</li>
            <li>I have used many gels in the past but this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but lots of it</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Best ever for unpredictable curls without crunch.</li>
            <li>Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li>Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing but there is a certain way you have to apply it ...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a recipe for disastrously huge hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition is no longer silicone free.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth shine.  </li>
            <li>For a naturally curly haired gal living in an area where humidity is a huge battle in the summer, this is by far the best product I have used!</li>
            <li>it still looks great the next day.</li>
            <li>and they feel so light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>ARE A FEW TIPS I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TO GET THE BEST RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your hair frizz free</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>id pay way more for the bottle it last a good month</li>
            <li>Also, stop thinking that if you keep looking and looking for that JUST RIGHT product, it will MAKE your hair magically change and become like someone else&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li>When it was all over and dry, her hair was beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this product on t.v.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products having naturally curly hair and this stuff rocks!!!!</li>
            <li>This product did a better job of producing uniform curls with just a light scrunching than any product I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Ouidad&#x27; is a unique and specialized haircut for curly hair; the hairdresser has to be specially trained at a Ouidad special class.</li>
            <li>It was actually a better product for letting my naturally wavy hair do what it wants to do and look nice than anything I&#x27;d used, and if I used an iron it would keep it smooth, and either way, NO FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do this for special events.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair is like straw the day I blow-dry it unless I use tons of oils and silicone-based products, but I used only this and a bit of mousse and its light, smooth, silky (but not fake shiny), and looks incredibly</li>
            <li>yes, but so true).  </li>
            <li>leave it nice and soft- style</li>
            <li>It helps so much with humidity and making the curls fall better.  </li>
            <li>The missus really likes this and keeps going back for more, so that&#x27;s about as good a recommendation as one can give.</li>
            <li>without intense humidity, it makes my hair significantly more manageable.</li>
            <li>Just got this full bottle, and I&#x27;m sitting here playing with my hair nonstop.</li>
            <li>I ordered the full size</li>
            <li>This product is good for frizzy coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing better for my curly hair - and that&#x27;s even in the damp humidity of Florida where I live now!</li>
            <li>The best hair product for seriously curly hair ever.</li>
            <li>but I am a huge fan thus far and recommend it to anyone with mostly curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Helps with my super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or stiff, just great light curls.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic and I highly reccommend to all my curly haired sisters!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls smooth and pretty, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li>If you live in the Denver area go to \\&quot;More than Curly Salon\\&quot; in Aurora ...</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m sure you know, Hawaii is notorious for the humidity and my hair is not used to all that since I live in the scorching, unforgiving desert that is Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I could get away with using less for a good hold on my fine curly hair, although I still need the finishing gel to release the crunchies.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After watching many, many, youtube, reviews on this product, I had a gut feeling for some strange reason I should just give it a try.</li>
            <li>After the sample ran out I realized it had been the difference, since I didn&#x27;t have a single good hair day without it.</li>
            <li>Thanks quidad!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s moisturizing (exactly what my thirsty curls want!)</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate (DC) and I need a gel that can really keep my hair looking nice.  </li>
            <li>It helps me to mix it a little with Ouidad Tress Effects but Climate Control works great by itself too.  </li>
            <li>Like most people with curly, frizzy, fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to find a solution for that frizz -- especially on humid days.</li>
            <li>As one who spends most of my time in high humidity, this product is an absolute must have!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my natural curly hair down here in Houston Texas!</li>
            <li>I recommend seeing a Ouidad stylist in your area if you have one available because I would have never applied that much product to anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It works great year round.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give hair that &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34; up look, still looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The only gel my hair has liked in the 5 years</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even mix the leave-in conditioner and the gel together in my hand before applying for a really soft and sexy head of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m favoring DevaCurl,  but more so jessicurl of natural hold.</li>
            <li>This product somehow makes it more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend, I have baby fine</li>
            <li>Just keep researching and you will eventually find the product that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>Living in hot, humid Houston takes a huge toll on any style, but my hair absolutely can&#x27;t function.</li>
            <li>I love this and am currently purchasing a full size bottle.    </li>
            <li>I have head full of thick curly hair, and this product is great...</li>
            <li>I have used it for years, and every time I try a &#x27;new&#x27; product, it is never as good, and I end up going back to Ouidad Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel.</li>
            <li>If you want a STRONGER, more apparent gel look, I&#x27;d suggest Biologe, which doesn&#x27;t flake-up</li>
            <li>I had several people at work say my hair looked “really good”  in a surprised voice.  </li>
            <li>Overall this gel is well worth it, keeps my hair healthy looking</li>
            <li>This causes me to be concerned whether I received the genuine product, or perhaps with her I received a very old bottle.</li>
            <li>Came very fast.</li>
            <li>But just rake it out with your fingers very gently.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally curly but also fine..  </li>
            <li>After reading so many of the great reviews, I bought this product and used it exactly as instructed with very poor results.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product that controls my huge, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for August!</li>
            <li>I first started using this gel in 2000, when I grew out a relaxer.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you follow the Curly Girl method, be aware that there is a non-water soluble silicone towards the bottom of the ingredient list (dimethicone).  </li>
            <li>In fact, my regular VO5 moose and Redken hair lotion worked 10 times better than this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, the first day I used it</li>
            <li>I did use grapeseed oil first then this product.</li>
            <li>I first used it at the Ouidad Salon in Santa Monica and had to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and tried alot of different products and even worked for a multinational health &amp; beauty company but never come across such a great product as this.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my stylist at a Ouidad salon which used a specific method of taming the curls, creating a healthy frizz-free head of hair.</li>
            <li>I find this product works pretty well, but it didn&#x27;t provide me the &amp;#34;humidity-proof&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I could write sonnets about how deep my love is for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have curly hair!!</li>
            <li>and finally I found a product that I love.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life that I had no, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m including the URL for those interested.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not going to hold, I get a lot of top frizzies/if hair is pulled back</li>
            <li>First I have to say that if you are going to purchase this product to try it for the first time buy it from the company website.</li>
            <li>I love this product and you can only order it online.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the only one that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my thick wiry hair.</li>
            <li>so it was trial and error at first.</li>
            <li>Yes it takes a bit more effort than just pulling it back...</li>
            <li>when I went to see the ocean for the first time and between the salt water beach and hotel shampoo, my hair became a straw like bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>Love thus stuff especially during the summer !!</li>
            <li>It feels gentle and soft on my hair and helps define my curls easily.</li>
            <li>I bought Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil leave-in conditioner (which I also loved!), some raw coconut oil, and this climate control gel to make sure my hair stayed hydrated and contained.</li>
            <li>I am a die hard Ouidad fan, and this is one of their main staples and best sellers in their flagship salon that I frequent.</li>
            <li>I live in hawaii which is super humid</li>
            <li>I live in a tiny town in a very rural area of Iowa, so Amazon is a great option for hard-to-find products for hard-to-control hair.</li>
            <li>I have read many of the comments, both positive and negative, and I am sure this product won&#x27;t work for everyone (nothing ever does)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that consistently works very well.</li>
            <li>I have tried every hair product out there for sleek frizz free hair and this is better than the most expensive frizz control and body producing products out there.</li>
            <li>I live in a pretty humid place so this works!</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair crunchy, and I do use more than a nickel size as stated on the bottle because I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>have read many people&#x27;s reviews complaining that this gel makes their hair dry.</li>
            <li>This is just pure madness.</li>
            <li>For me this gel does that little miracle in an amazingly effortless fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was very pricy</li>
            <li>and they get really crunchy.  </li>
            <li>This really seems to help.</li>
            <li>My hair is not curly, it&#x27;s straight, but in the humid south it frizzes and looses</li>
            <li>Really helps with the frizz and seems to encourage the curl, so it seems curly, not straggly.</li>
            <li>if you use too much product your hair does not curl&lt;</li>
            <li>and she really likes.</li>
            <li>She has very curl hair and Ouidad</li>
            <li>and lately it&#x27;s really affected by humidity.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps.  </li>
            <li>Would really recommend for efficiency and frizz control.</li>
            <li>i dont have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This product, along with the Botanical Boost, did absolutely nothing for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t look like a gel in your hair but goes in wet.  </li>
            <li>i have really curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it does, but using all three products together makes my hair so much nicer looking.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how it feels as I apply it.</li>
            <li>Really helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going outdoors, and you&#x27;re really going to work up a sweat</li>
            <li>It controls and manages my frizz whether I&#x27;m wearing my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li>For as much money as I paid for this I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li>It also has a very synthetic chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had curly hair my whole life....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know my head was capable of sprouting; every curl was like a Shirley Temple</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ready to show yourself to the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use too much my curls get crispy</li>
            <li>so my hair may not need as much as specified.</li>
            <li>The only gel that give me shiny frizz free curls...</li>
            <li>and they really stay bouncy and put all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I gave up on it and wore my hair in a big ol&#x27; soft afro-poof most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I went back to my old styling method, it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, not sticky, and gives your hair shine and hold all day whether you air dry it or style with hot tools.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or yucky feeling and curls stay nice for up to three days between washing.</li>
            <li>But after using this product my hairs are becoming dry and losing shine.</li>
            <li>You can use a diffuser dryer on low if you want it to dry more quickly.</li>
            <li>We live in Utah where the dry climate can make for interesting challenges with curly hair</li>
            <li>Now Im “mature” and color my hair, it frizzes immediately and trying to straighten it just makes it worse, hot rollers look great for an hour</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and have looked in the mirror probably 50 times because I can&#x27;t believe how soft and sleek my hair is!</li>
            <li>Works better on curly hair than any other gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does anything more than other products out there.</li>
            <li>It gives my curls a medium hold, and I love it just because my hair is not crispy like other gels tend to do to my hair.</li>
            <li>The next thing I do is apply about 2-3 quarter size amounts of a good, moisturizing leave in conditioner; (you may need less)</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what this naturally frizzy head of hair needed.</li>
            <li>They have a 30 day full money back guarantee of you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Kinky Curly\\&quot; better than this product, as this product doesn&#x27;t do as much as the other 2 to clearly define and hold my curls.</li>
            <li>Typical for most curlies, right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have type 3b/3c hair with high porosity.  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>highly suggest anyone with frizzy, unruly hair try this and switching to a cleansing conditioner (like Wen, but there are cheaper versions).</li>
            <li>This gel worked well on my naturally curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it worked any better than other gels I have tried.  </li>
            <li>If there was a smell, it&#x27;s pretty mild and won&#x27;t interfere with any other scents you may be wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how much gel the stylist recommended to use.</li>
            <li>Oidad products were developed with real curly hair issues in mind.</li>
            <li>At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t work on its own as a curl definer.  </li>
            <li>Of course, if you love your curls, this will enhance them with a few scrunches.</li>
            <li>However, I discovered Ouidad a few months ago and am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I love my thick, wavy hair without having to burn it into submission with an iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally normal.</li>
            <li>It does take away a good bit of it, but I usually have to follow up with some coconut oil to calm my hair down the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>Most of us have tried literally dozens upon dozens of products to try to tame our curls and get us out the door on time.</li>
            <li>This gel alone isn&#x27;t going to make your unruly curly hair magically become tame...</li>
            <li>We live in the Chicago, Il area and drove 27 miles to the Cheveux Salon in Glen Ellyn, Il.</li>
            <li>I live in a forest in the mountains, and our humidity is always 85-100%.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston humidity</li>
            <li>in all: This is one of my new holy grail products.</li>
            <li>Brand new product for me, never heard of it before....</li>
            <li>and I live on the east coast, which has both weather extremes.</li>
            <li>I am adjusting to a new climate so that could be part of the problem.</li>
            <li>Before applying Ouidad gel, your hair must be clean and SOAKING, DRIPPING, wet.</li>
            <li>last three days just add a lil water and is back to looking fabulous</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be advised that this is a definitely a gel, and gels don&#x27;t work that well for me in any right, so I&#x27;m not too surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow my hair is shiny!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a mistake, I usually buy another of the Ouidad products but found I like this one more.  </li>
            <li>If you have been looking for a product for your naturally curly  hair, this is it!</li>
            <li>Combine that with the hot, humid southern summer</li>
            <li>I am not sure why the sample size worked better, perhaps they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it crunchy at all.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to turn your head upside down and apply to the back.</li>
            <li>Use a bit more on dry hair; just a pea size drop, combed through for wet hair.</li>
            <li>product probably works pretty well for other people, but for me it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I put off purchasing it due to its high price for five months, but now after using it for a week again, I know it is the right investment for myself.</li>
            <li>My issue was that though many products &#x27;work&#x27; on my hair, they mostly just leave it dry and unmanageable after a few hours which means I was washing my hair everyday if I wanted it to stay curly.  </li>
            <li>I finish the process with the clear pomade</li>
            <li>I started using Ouidad products when I wore my hair in its natural curl.  </li>
            <li>For those who are protein sensitive, this gel isn&#x27;t for you either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was young, it was auburn and curly.</li>
            <li>It  doesn’t guk up, hair stays soft.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to go to a OUIDAD Certified Salon and have the haircut designed for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>the people there are professional and are committed to educating and empowering the curly hair community (one curl at a time ...</li>
            <li>Its so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft but defines my curl while controlling frizz.</li>
            <li>Hair stays soft, unlike gels that can give the hair a crunchy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Found a video on YouTube by VeronicaMeza titled \\&quot;How to Style Naturally Curly Hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There is finally a product for curly hair that really works.</li>
            <li>So far this product has done well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it didn&#x27;t take away as much frizz as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference to my big hair.</li>
            <li>(my texture is 3C with some 4A on the sides, for those of you in the natural hair community)</li>
            <li>in awe of how my curls finally look very close to how I&#x27;ve always wanted them to.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>We all have natural curly hair and it keeps the frizz under control .</li>
            <li>and you have soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>(you only need a nickel sized amount for each section of hair) and the no frizz action lasts for days!!!</li>
            <li>My 15 yr old daughter has long and very curly hair with a considerable amount of frizz.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same as it always did even after using it several times.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for a person who lives in a humid climate and has curls they want to actually curl without the frizz.</li>
            <li>At the time I&#x27;d started using several new products</li>
            <li>I discovered I had a Ouidad salon in my new hometown, so after the birth of my 2nd child...</li>
            <li>Leave on for 5-10 minute, gently scrunch with fingers and don&#x27;t touch your hair till it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>It always gets crinkly on my hair and my hair takes much longer to dry with this in it.</li>
            <li>This is ok for short term but it quickly loses efficiency after about an hour.</li>
            <li>I used to use a palm full of product in an attempt to tame those curls.</li>
            <li>I originally followed their directions for styling, but found that my hair type needs a be worked with a little differently.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, fine, and tends to curl.</li>
            <li>I have a major collection of sprays, argon and jojoba oil and general goo for my hair.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer but thee results are worth it.</li>
            <li>If I told you how much money I spent on hair products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I have completely confused you now.  </li>
            <li>I live in the caribbean and this gel goes a long way</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample and was skeptical prior to my first attempt at using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice-smelling, gentle, lightweight product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or cause \\&quot;crunchy hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You can get rid of the crinkly, after the hair is dry, by using the Clear Control Pomade.  </li>
            <li>I used my normal shampoo and while it was wet, I applied the Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel, only I did it my way.  </li>
            <li>I live where it is extremely humid.</li>
            <li>My hair color is between blonde and light brown, and very thick.</li>

            <li> However, it is the best hair gel I have used for this purpose (one good hair day).</li>
            <li> rk really good diffine curl must have it hold the curl for about 3 days great great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product.</li>
            <li> Like I said If I hadn&#x27;t seen the stylist do this with my own eyes and see the wonderful results I would have NEVER applied the gel like this.    </li>
            <li> Climate Control is a great gel for me.  </li>
            <li> Climate Control is a great gel for me.  </li>
            <li> , she told me to use this product for summer and that in the winter, when the humidity goes away, I can switch to the Curl Quencher line which is great for dryer climates.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel even though it is way overpriced because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> this product is great for controlling my frizz compared to this company moisturizing curl quencher gel.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> I like to use it in tandem with the Ouidad Shine serum -- great combination.</li>
            <li> Great hair days every time I use it...</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> This product is great in the Wisconsin summer months.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for curly haired people livening in Florida..keeps the frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crispy.&amp;#34; When I&#x27;m staying indoors, I&#x27;m happy with the result.</li>
            <li> On outdoors, when I went tourist exploring on vacation in Vegas heat, I was still happy with results.</li>
            <li> I just keep looking in the mirror throughout the day, (even in the bathroom at work, lol)</li>
            <li> Works great on me and my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> If you want great looking curls</li>
            <li> Great but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I would recommend it for anyone who has problems with frizz</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> , I thought I&#x27;d just pass on buying any; boy, am I glad I decided to revisit the idea!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> and I am still in love with this product and very happy with the way the work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to duplicate the awesome curls every time doing it the way my stylist showed me.</li>
            <li> Great detangled and smells good too</li>
            <li> I find that it isn&#x27;t a good stand alone gel, as it doesn&#x27;t give me the definition I like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good gel.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find another conditioner that gave me good results</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find another conditioner that gave me good results</li>
            <li> My curls never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> is a good product</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair, and have always struggled between the frizzy, wild-woman look with no product, vs. the crunchy, wet-look of gels and mousse.  </li>
            <li> LOVED ALL THE QUIDAD PRODUCTS, BUT COULD NOT AFFORD THEM.  </li>
            <li> Good value and didn&#x27;t have to drive to the store to get it.</li>
            <li> really loved the consistency of this gel</li>
            <li> However it is still good when I don&#x27;t have time to do curlers etc.</li>
            <li> so this product is good when I can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> re-do every day, as I cannot use a curling brush with good effect after using the stuff.</li>
            <li> to bouncy, shiny, and just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dries my waves stay smooth and my hair looks great all day! ...</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this from birchbox.com and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Really good for styling and humid conditions.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with curly hair appreciates it when someone recommends a product that actually is good, I&#x27;m spreading the love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have pretty curly hair and like to wear it curly, so i&#x27;m always on the prowl for the perfect curl product.</li>
            <li> and now Im in love!  </li>
            <li> love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> awesome for curly hair, arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Love the way it calms frizz and makes styling curly hair easier!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I know lots of people love this stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly type 3 a (S pattern) and this gel really helped define my curls !!!!!</li>
            <li> This gel is light but gives my curls a great hold that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> this is an amazing product u work in sections</li>
            <li> For someone that has very curly hair that frizzes in the rain or humidity, this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make it crunchy, which i liked, but it just made it WAY too curly.</li>
            <li> , i purchased it, but i much rather prefer products like Aquage curl cream, which is the best product i&#x27;ve found for my curly hair to date (they have this on Amazon as well if you&#x27;d like to check it out).</li>
            <li> When I use the Ouidad on its own, I tend to get stringlets</li>
            <li> Its absolute perfection: no frizz, perfectly defined curls, and my hair doesnt puff up after a day.</li>
            <li> I will be honest.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but not as good as its sister product, Botanical Boost.</li>
            <li> I was impressed on how fast I received it.</li>
            <li> Climate Control is awesome and buying it through Amazon is much faster than their the company&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best product ever made for curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> but it is not as great as I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for curly hair and high humidity areas.</li>
            <li> great for super frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on buying more!</li>
            <li> Great for hot humid summer weather!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far for controlling my usually-uncontrollable curly hair.</li>
            <li> Using this product protects my hair from the heat of my blow dryer and leaves it with a nice healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> This is far the best climate control product for my hear that I ever had.</li>
            <li> I have tried practically every product I can get my hands on and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years directly from Ouidad, it&#x27;s always been great, and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I recently experienced Ouidad for the first time at my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Works great on my frizzy, fine hair, even on hot and humid days!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love my hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t applied like gel at all more like conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It really eliminates frizz, isn&#x27;t too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  </li>
            <li> It really eliminates frizz, isn&#x27;t too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it one more chance and this has slip and held my curls.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> The stylist used a method called rake and shake which separated each curl and gave me a Shirley temple look (which I wasn&#x27;t in love with as a woman over 40)</li>
            <li> Oh and one more thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been out most of the morning</li>
            <li> Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz..</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> Does what it says, feels light and keeps the frizz at bay!  </li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> this is light weight and feels like you have nothing in your hair!</li>
            <li> You have to use so much and the results aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> My hair looked ok</li>
            <li> And trust me I have tried many, many products on the market.</li>
            <li> However, I still needed to use another product with it to ensure a stronger hold as I have some curls that become more like waves by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> more intact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product - its my favorite curly hair product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I love the ouidad line</li>
            <li> you may have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> more is more.</li>
            <li> you have a crunch problem with this product, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Just comment! :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair not frizz, but my hair was so beautifully defined!</li>
            <li> Ouidad is my favorite hair care line ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for many years and would never be caught without it.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Un-freakin&#x27;-believable.</li>
            <li> I will say, and I&#x27;m sure if you have curly hair</li>
            <li> more than four) continuing until all of your hair is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now manipulate your curls till you&#x27;re satisfied with the way they look...</li>
            <li> I love buying Ouidad products from Amazon as I know I am getting what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair is in the j-lo territory if j-lo didn&#x27;t have the funds to have her hair perfectly blownout on a daily basis!!  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I still use this stuff on days I want to shower and airdry and know that my hair will look OK.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li> as noted previously, i love the product and the experience, ordering, shipment and charging went without flaws.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , the more you handle them</li>
            <li> the more unruly they become.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair frizz free with my curls nicely formed.  </li>
            <li> And i am sure yours will too :)</li>
            <li> I am finally able to stop searching.</li>
            <li> but truthfully I am using it plus additional product.</li>
            <li> Love all Ouidad products</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Soft, beautiful hair, what more can you want.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of controlling my summer high humidity</li>
            <li> My curls were PERFECT ringlets and super soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This particular product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found for hot, humid summer days.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that if you need to reactivate this gel, you don&#x27;t have to add more, you just have to wet your hair just a bit</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I thought this gel would be fine for me.</li>
            <li> Very cool product for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair, so at the end of blow drying my hair, when it&#x27;s still a bit damp, I run some of the Ouidad through my hair and it makes it more smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair stays frizz free even on the most humid of days.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product to keep the curls soft.</li>
            <li> The product was processed and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> My fine hair frizzes so easily in the Georgia heat.</li>
            <li> I still had a headful of beautiful curls the next day after dancing, drinking and sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Hands down - this is the best hair gel I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li> I live in Savannah so the product gets put through the ringer fairly often.</li>
            <li> I have used many gels in the past but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but lots of it</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Best ever for unpredictable curls without crunch.</li>
            <li> Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li> Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing but there is a certain way you have to apply it ...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a recipe for disastrously huge hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition is no longer silicone free.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth shine.  </li>
            <li> For a naturally curly haired gal living in an area where humidity is a huge battle in the summer, this is by far the best product I have used!</li>
            <li> it still looks great the next day.</li>
            <li> and they feel so light.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> ARE A FEW TIPS I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TO GET THE BEST RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your hair frizz free</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> id pay way more for the bottle it last a good month</li>
            <li> Also, stop thinking that if you keep looking and looking for that JUST RIGHT product, it will MAKE your hair magically change and become like someone else&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li> When it was all over and dry, her hair was beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this product on t.v.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products having naturally curly hair and this stuff rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> This product did a better job of producing uniform curls with just a light scrunching than any product I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Ouidad&#x27; is a unique and specialized haircut for curly hair; the hairdresser has to be specially trained at a Ouidad special class.</li>
            <li> It was actually a better product for letting my naturally wavy hair do what it wants to do and look nice than anything I&#x27;d used, and if I used an iron it would keep it smooth, and either way, NO FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do this for special events.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is like straw the day I blow-dry it unless I use tons of oils and silicone-based products, but I used only this and a bit of mousse and its light, smooth, silky (but not fake shiny), and looks incredibly</li>
            <li> yes, but so true).  </li>
            <li> leave it nice and soft- style</li>
            <li> It helps so much with humidity and making the curls fall better.  </li>
            <li> The missus really likes this and keeps going back for more, so that&#x27;s about as good a recommendation as one can give.</li>
            <li> without intense humidity, it makes my hair significantly more manageable.</li>
            <li> Just got this full bottle, and I&#x27;m sitting here playing with my hair nonstop.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full size</li>
            <li> This product is good for frizzy coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing better for my curly hair - and that&#x27;s even in the damp humidity of Florida where I live now!</li>
            <li> The best hair product for seriously curly hair ever.</li>
            <li> but I am a huge fan thus far and recommend it to anyone with mostly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my super frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or stiff, just great light curls.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic and I highly reccommend to all my curly haired sisters!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls smooth and pretty, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> If you live in the Denver area go to \\&quot;More than Curly Salon\\&quot; in Aurora ...</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m sure you know, Hawaii is notorious for the humidity and my hair is not used to all that since I live in the scorching, unforgiving desert that is Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could get away with using less for a good hold on my fine curly hair, although I still need the finishing gel to release the crunchies.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After watching many, many, youtube, reviews on this product, I had a gut feeling for some strange reason I should just give it a try.</li>
            <li> After the sample ran out I realized it had been the difference, since I didn&#x27;t have a single good hair day without it.</li>
            <li> Thanks quidad!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s moisturizing (exactly what my thirsty curls want!)</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate (DC) and I need a gel that can really keep my hair looking nice.  </li>
            <li> It helps me to mix it a little with Ouidad Tress Effects but Climate Control works great by itself too.  </li>
            <li> Like most people with curly, frizzy, fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to find a solution for that frizz -- especially on humid days.</li>
            <li> As one who spends most of my time in high humidity, this product is an absolute must have!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural curly hair down here in Houston Texas!</li>
            <li> I recommend seeing a Ouidad stylist in your area if you have one available because I would have never applied that much product to anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It works great year round.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give hair that &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34; up look, still looks more natural.</li>
            <li> The only gel my hair has liked in the 5 years</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even mix the leave-in conditioner and the gel together in my hand before applying for a really soft and sexy head of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m favoring DevaCurl,  but more so jessicurl of natural hold.</li>
            <li> This product somehow makes it more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend, I have baby fine</li>
            <li> Just keep researching and you will eventually find the product that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> Living in hot, humid Houston takes a huge toll on any style, but my hair absolutely can&#x27;t function.</li>
            <li> I love this and am currently purchasing a full size bottle.    </li>
            <li> I have head full of thick curly hair, and this product is great...</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, and every time I try a &#x27;new&#x27; product, it is never as good, and I end up going back to Ouidad Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel.</li>
            <li> If you want a STRONGER, more apparent gel look, I&#x27;d suggest Biologe, which doesn&#x27;t flake-up</li>
            <li> I had several people at work say my hair looked “really good”  in a surprised voice.  </li>
            <li> Overall this gel is well worth it, keeps my hair healthy looking</li>
            <li> This causes me to be concerned whether I received the genuine product, or perhaps with her I received a very old bottle.</li>
            <li> Came very fast.</li>
            <li> But just rake it out with your fingers very gently.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally curly but also fine..  </li>
            <li> After reading so many of the great reviews, I bought this product and used it exactly as instructed with very poor results.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that controls my huge, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for August!</li>
            <li> I first started using this gel in 2000, when I grew out a relaxer.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you follow the Curly Girl method, be aware that there is a non-water soluble silicone towards the bottom of the ingredient list (dimethicone).  </li>
            <li> In fact, my regular VO5 moose and Redken hair lotion worked 10 times better than this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, the first day I used it</li>
            <li> I did use grapeseed oil first then this product.</li>
            <li> I first used it at the Ouidad Salon in Santa Monica and had to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and tried alot of different products and even worked for a multinational health &amp; beauty company but never come across such a great product as this.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my stylist at a Ouidad salon which used a specific method of taming the curls, creating a healthy frizz-free head of hair.</li>
            <li> I find this product works pretty well, but it didn&#x27;t provide me the &amp;#34;humidity-proof&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I could write sonnets about how deep my love is for this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have curly hair!!</li>
            <li> and finally I found a product that I love.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that I had no, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m including the URL for those interested.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not going to hold, I get a lot of top frizzies/if hair is pulled back</li>
            <li> First I have to say that if you are going to purchase this product to try it for the first time buy it from the company website.</li>
            <li> I love this product and you can only order it online.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the only one that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my thick wiry hair.</li>
            <li> so it was trial and error at first.</li>
            <li> Yes it takes a bit more effort than just pulling it back...</li>
            <li> when I went to see the ocean for the first time and between the salt water beach and hotel shampoo, my hair became a straw like bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> Love thus stuff especially during the summer !!</li>
            <li> It feels gentle and soft on my hair and helps define my curls easily.</li>
            <li> I bought Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil leave-in conditioner (which I also loved!), some raw coconut oil, and this climate control gel to make sure my hair stayed hydrated and contained.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard Ouidad fan, and this is one of their main staples and best sellers in their flagship salon that I frequent.</li>
            <li> I live in hawaii which is super humid</li>
            <li> I live in a tiny town in a very rural area of Iowa, so Amazon is a great option for hard-to-find products for hard-to-control hair.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the comments, both positive and negative, and I am sure this product won&#x27;t work for everyone (nothing ever does)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that consistently works very well.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair product out there for sleek frizz free hair and this is better than the most expensive frizz control and body producing products out there.</li>
            <li> I live in a pretty humid place so this works!</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair crunchy, and I do use more than a nickel size as stated on the bottle because I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> have read many people&#x27;s reviews complaining that this gel makes their hair dry.</li>
            <li> This is just pure madness.</li>
            <li> For me this gel does that little miracle in an amazingly effortless fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was very pricy</li>
            <li> and they get really crunchy.  </li>
            <li> This really seems to help.</li>
            <li> My hair is not curly, it&#x27;s straight, but in the humid south it frizzes and looses</li>
            <li> Really helps with the frizz and seems to encourage the curl, so it seems curly, not straggly.</li>
            <li> if you use too much product your hair does not curl&lt;</li>
            <li> and she really likes.</li>
            <li> She has very curl hair and Ouidad</li>
            <li> and lately it&#x27;s really affected by humidity.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps.  </li>
            <li> Would really recommend for efficiency and frizz control.</li>
            <li> i dont have very curly hair</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Botanical Boost, did absolutely nothing for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t look like a gel in your hair but goes in wet.  </li>
            <li> i have really curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it does, but using all three products together makes my hair so much nicer looking.  </li>
            <li> and I really like how it feels as I apply it.</li>
            <li> Really helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going outdoors, and you&#x27;re really going to work up a sweat</li>
            <li> It controls and manages my frizz whether I&#x27;m wearing my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> For as much money as I paid for this I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It also has a very synthetic chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had curly hair my whole life....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my head was capable of sprouting; every curl was like a Shirley Temple</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re ready to show yourself to the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use too much my curls get crispy</li>
            <li> so my hair may not need as much as specified.</li>
            <li> The only gel that give me shiny frizz free curls...</li>
            <li> and they really stay bouncy and put all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I gave up on it and wore my hair in a big ol&#x27; soft afro-poof most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I went back to my old styling method, it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, not sticky, and gives your hair shine and hold all day whether you air dry it or style with hot tools.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or yucky feeling and curls stay nice for up to three days between washing.</li>
            <li> But after using this product my hairs are becoming dry and losing shine.</li>
            <li> You can use a diffuser dryer on low if you want it to dry more quickly.</li>
            <li> We live in Utah where the dry climate can make for interesting challenges with curly hair</li>
            <li> Now Im “mature” and color my hair, it frizzes immediately and trying to straighten it just makes it worse, hot rollers look great for an hour</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and have looked in the mirror probably 50 times because I can&#x27;t believe how soft and sleek my hair is!</li>
            <li> Works better on curly hair than any other gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does anything more than other products out there.</li>
            <li> It gives my curls a medium hold, and I love it just because my hair is not crispy like other gels tend to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> The next thing I do is apply about 2-3 quarter size amounts of a good, moisturizing leave in conditioner; (you may need less)</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what this naturally frizzy head of hair needed.</li>
            <li> They have a 30 day full money back guarantee of you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Kinky Curly\\&quot; better than this product, as this product doesn&#x27;t do as much as the other 2 to clearly define and hold my curls.</li>
            <li> Typical for most curlies, right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have type 3b/3c hair with high porosity.  </li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> highly suggest anyone with frizzy, unruly hair try this and switching to a cleansing conditioner (like Wen, but there are cheaper versions).</li>
            <li> This gel worked well on my naturally curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it worked any better than other gels I have tried.  </li>
            <li> If there was a smell, it&#x27;s pretty mild and won&#x27;t interfere with any other scents you may be wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how much gel the stylist recommended to use.</li>
            <li> Oidad products were developed with real curly hair issues in mind.</li>
            <li> At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t work on its own as a curl definer.  </li>
            <li> Of course, if you love your curls, this will enhance them with a few scrunches.</li>
            <li> However, I discovered Ouidad a few months ago and am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I love my thick, wavy hair without having to burn it into submission with an iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally normal.</li>
            <li> It does take away a good bit of it, but I usually have to follow up with some coconut oil to calm my hair down the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> Most of us have tried literally dozens upon dozens of products to try to tame our curls and get us out the door on time.</li>
            <li> This gel alone isn&#x27;t going to make your unruly curly hair magically become tame...</li>
            <li> We live in the Chicago, Il area and drove 27 miles to the Cheveux Salon in Glen Ellyn, Il.</li>
            <li> I live in a forest in the mountains, and our humidity is always 85-100%.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston humidity</li>
            <li> in all: This is one of my new holy grail products.</li>
            <li> Brand new product for me, never heard of it before....</li>
            <li> and I live on the east coast, which has both weather extremes.</li>
            <li> I am adjusting to a new climate so that could be part of the problem.</li>
            <li> Before applying Ouidad gel, your hair must be clean and SOAKING, DRIPPING, wet.</li>
            <li> last three days just add a lil water and is back to looking fabulous</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be advised that this is a definitely a gel, and gels don&#x27;t work that well for me in any right, so I&#x27;m not too surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow my hair is shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mistake, I usually buy another of the Ouidad products but found I like this one more.  </li>
            <li> If you have been looking for a product for your naturally curly  hair, this is it!</li>
            <li> Combine that with the hot, humid southern summer</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the sample size worked better, perhaps they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it crunchy at all.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to turn your head upside down and apply to the back.</li>
            <li> Use a bit more on dry hair; just a pea size drop, combed through for wet hair.</li>
            <li> product probably works pretty well for other people, but for me it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I put off purchasing it due to its high price for five months, but now after using it for a week again, I know it is the right investment for myself.</li>
            <li> My issue was that though many products &#x27;work&#x27; on my hair, they mostly just leave it dry and unmanageable after a few hours which means I was washing my hair everyday if I wanted it to stay curly.  </li>
            <li> I finish the process with the clear pomade</li>
            <li> I started using Ouidad products when I wore my hair in its natural curl.  </li>
            <li> For those who are protein sensitive, this gel isn&#x27;t for you either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was young, it was auburn and curly.</li>
            <li> It  doesn’t guk up, hair stays soft.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to go to a OUIDAD Certified Salon and have the haircut designed for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> the people there are professional and are committed to educating and empowering the curly hair community (one curl at a time ...</li>
            <li> Its so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft but defines my curl while controlling frizz.</li>
            <li> Hair stays soft, unlike gels that can give the hair a crunchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Found a video on YouTube by VeronicaMeza titled \\&quot;How to Style Naturally Curly Hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There is finally a product for curly hair that really works.</li>
            <li> So far this product has done well.</li>
            <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it didn&#x27;t take away as much frizz as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference to my big hair.</li>
            <li> (my texture is 3C with some 4A on the sides, for those of you in the natural hair community)</li>
            <li> in awe of how my curls finally look very close to how I&#x27;ve always wanted them to.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> We all have natural curly hair and it keeps the frizz under control .</li>
            <li> and you have soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> (you only need a nickel sized amount for each section of hair) and the no frizz action lasts for days!!!</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old daughter has long and very curly hair with a considerable amount of frizz.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same as it always did even after using it several times.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for a person who lives in a humid climate and has curls they want to actually curl without the frizz.</li>
            <li> At the time I&#x27;d started using several new products</li>
            <li> I discovered I had a Ouidad salon in my new hometown, so after the birth of my 2nd child...</li>
            <li> Leave on for 5-10 minute, gently scrunch with fingers and don&#x27;t touch your hair till it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> It always gets crinkly on my hair and my hair takes much longer to dry with this in it.</li>
            <li> This is ok for short term but it quickly loses efficiency after about an hour.</li>
            <li> I used to use a palm full of product in an attempt to tame those curls.</li>
            <li> I originally followed their directions for styling, but found that my hair type needs a be worked with a little differently.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, fine, and tends to curl.</li>
            <li> I have a major collection of sprays, argon and jojoba oil and general goo for my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer but thee results are worth it.</li>
            <li> If I told you how much money I spent on hair products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I have completely confused you now.  </li>
            <li> I live in the caribbean and this gel goes a long way</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and was skeptical prior to my first attempt at using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice-smelling, gentle, lightweight product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or cause \\&quot;crunchy hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You can get rid of the crinkly, after the hair is dry, by using the Clear Control Pomade.  </li>
            <li> I used my normal shampoo and while it was wet, I applied the Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel, only I did it my way.  </li>
            <li> I live where it is extremely humid.</li>
            <li> My hair color is between blonde and light brown, and very thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of other gels and now I only buy this one, I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles so far because I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I only &#x27;do&#x27; my hair every other day and it takes me ~20 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way, so this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s their base product that helps create all the &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; This is better than any ordinary hair gel - light weight, not heavy nor sticky.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long &amp; thick, so this bottle is used up quickly.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m 25 yrs old; that&#x27;s not exactly the look i&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair which I kept pulled back in a slick bun for YEARS.</li>
            <li> Just pea sized amount is enough for my entire head of hair, therefore the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Use this product on wet hair and let dry naturally....</li>
            <li> this is a KEY step to avoid your hair feeling and looking dry when it&#x27;s finally done.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length, layered, thick, but fine.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review Amazon products because I buy SO much on Amazon - it would take forever.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t apply it to small sections at a time it doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a product.</li>
            <li> after applying the product, i ended up taking a flat iron to my curls to soften them out a bit.</li>
            <li> Only need a dime size,  lays a long time</li>
            <li> Tired of having a cabinet full of curly hair products that don&#x27;t work??</li>
            <li> This was recommended my a friend whose daughter has a similar hair type, but it made my daughter&#x27;s 3a/3b hair so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair was left dry and curls frizzy after using Ouidad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I just use the botanical boot, and my hair goes back to soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I actually hate doing the whole process, but I give it 4 stars because it does make my hair look better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the humidity control worked any better than any of the other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I never use a brush, only wide combs.</li>
            <li> Product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly, long.</li>
            <li> use minimal product on DAMP hair, maybe a dime size through the top/scalp part of my hair and same dose through the length-to tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> If applied after washing my hair, his gel defines my curl pattern and keeps it intact long after my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a gel that works with my thick, naturally curly hair, which, like me, does what it wants and usually doesn&#x27;t behave.</li>
            <li> I do not have really long hair</li>
            <li> Soft, manageable curls, even through humid TN and NC summers and can now handle the Pacific Northwest weather year round.</li>
            <li> My hair came out soft and crazy full of body.  </li>
            <li> hair is 2c/3a, thick and very frizz prone.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I received is in a different packaging than what is shown, and different then the dozen or so previous bottles I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse curly hair, so if you have less coarse hair</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a long time user of Ouidad Climate Control who went back to it due to a return to curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other products and came back to Quidad.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited this long!</li>
            <li> If you comb it through and want your hair to dry curly, just wrap your head in a terry hair turban after combing product through.</li>
            <li> I use a quarter size amount on damp hair then I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use the Ouidad Rake &amp; Shake technique and blow dry using a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> my curls and the mist helps my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> Just apply the Climate Control, rake &amp; shake until your curls are set the way you want them, mist with the hairspray, blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Then using your fingers when hair is completely dry, arrange your curls if they need it.  </li>
            <li> AIR DRY.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly, frizzy, slightly dry hair and bought this gel to use on my trip to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> My curls even remain defined and unfrizzed when I play in it after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Sit under a hood dryer for 20 minutes to get it about 50% dry, (this helps me decrease shrinkage, and I noticed that they do this quite a bit in the salon after apply finishing products) or just air dry.</li>
            <li> This truly transforms my curls from dry, unruly....</li>
            <li> She did the rake and shake, let the curls dry</li>
            <li> Try the just natural frizz control hairline, expensive but do you really want to put a price on beauty?</li>
            <li> The next day however I was convinced it was a waste of money because I simply couldn&#x27;t make it look like she did</li>
            <li> I am African-American, I am completely natural (no relaxer or hair color on my hair), and have thick, coarse 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> this product does not live up to its promise.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon run by a single lady, (not a chain store), and she put this product in my hair.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is add a small amount to hair before blow-drying or letting your hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Too weird (and too cool)</li>
            <li> It worked well for me, but always mixed with another gel to weigh my hair down a bit (I like to reduce curl, not enhance).  </li>
            <li> down side is that it only lasts one day.</li>
            <li> it either got crunchy dry or wet</li>
            <li> I have long thick naturally curly (caucasian) hair.</li>
            <li> My hair also stopped getting greasier and heavy since my old products weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry out and let&#x27;s me keep my curls for a few days.</li>
            <li> I used to spend forever with my flat iron trying to tame it, but i have put my flat iron away since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do the whole thing nearly as well as my hair cutting person.  </li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it,</li>
            <li> Just hold and lift carefully to keep you curls.</li>
            <li> a few days later, I decided to give it another try.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds trying to find hair products that will keep it from frizzing up when I walk out</li>
            <li> be careful...</li>
            <li> I also have to diffuse my hair because I can&#x27;t stand it wet</li>
            <li> it does have a sort of wet look to it though.</li>
            <li> not really....</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t had luck with this product, chances are you are missing one crucial point.</li>
            <li> YOUR HAIR HAS TO BE SOPPING WET</li>
            <li> SOPPING WET...</li>
            <li> Only a few brands have worked for me.</li>
            <li> The crunchy wet look will go away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has DEFINED my curls, softened my hair, and decreased shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Be generous when applying the product, because it is water based and very light,(kinda like a thin pancake syrup) but not TOO generous or it will flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive but truly worth it.</li>
            <li> I always had such trouble with my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> product is similar to gel but not as heavy; it penetrates the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> (diffuser not a lot of handling the hair), at that point I was initially freaked out because it was so stiff.</li>
            <li> Ouidad Climate Control is the only product that can tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Even when I use a diffuser with this product my curls don&#x27;t look tight but at least they are defined without frizz and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I also found that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and like liquid, so be careful when you first use it as I got way too</li>
            <li> We purchused the Climate control heat &amp; humidity gel and some of the other Ouidad products from the salon couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I just hope that Ouidad expands into other markets so I can get it beyond USA.</li>
            <li> Found this link extremely helpful:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> ; results I was expecting based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I will be a life time customer of this product and plan to try other products in this line.  </li>
            <li> so I recommend this if you are having hair issues due to weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved on to other hair brands but</li>
            <li> I like other products in their line</li>
            <li> I usually apply about 2-3 quarter sized amounts in my hair, then spread it evenly especially on my ends which always tend to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is the worst gel I have tried so far and since trying the curly girl method, I have tried many.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too loose for something this heavy.  </li>
            <li> But I use less than a quarter-size dollop of this, usually mixing with a similar amount a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> so it does not weigh my hair down like other gels.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s six of one, half dozen of the other.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, tight ringlet hair.  </li>
            <li> I took it with me when I went to Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, hoping this would control the frizz from the humidity, but it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot but weigh random parts of my hair down.</li>
            <li> When it arrived though, it seemed to be a different consistency than the normal product, very thin and not as viscous as usual.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how it weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I always wear my down in front</li>
            <li> I feel it tones down the frizzies, keeps my hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t way down my curls but my ringlets keep their shape without feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li> gel is lightweight and not sticky but still manages to shape my curls without holding them down.</li>
            <li> I have spent years (and lots of money) looking for something that would help tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried it again with less and it was still greasy.</li>
            <li> This product does not prevent the curling, but it allows my hair to become less frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Just wish it costed less.</li>
            <li> Curly hair typically doesn&#x27;t get shiny but this gel adds a bit of shine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually controls my thick curls.</li>
            <li> This product works without the crunch of typical gels.</li>
            <li> My hair has been a frizzy mess for 53 years.</li>
            <li> My hair curls tightly</li>
            <li> It somewhat control frizz but no better than other products intended for that use for less money.</li>
            <li> Well this product definitely doesn&#x27;t make your curls hard because it doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li> After your hair is at least 80% dry, rub a moisturizing serum, oil, or pomade into your hands and distribute throughout your hair, which simultaneously gets rid of that crunchy gel feel.</li>
            <li> When it is hot as hades outside it keeps my hair from looking like someone shook the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> so I tried in on my little sister in law that has wavy hair</li>
            <li> ...use it with a little bit of moraccean oil</li>
            <li> I put the gel in my hair, then i scrunch it a little bit and that is all.</li>
            <li> This gel helps tame the frizz, define my curls and retain moisture without making my curls &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I also use a lot less of this than inexpensive store brands.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a bit too heavy and sticky for my hair, no matter how little I used.  </li>
            <li> It helps my curls keep their shape without any heavy, greasey, crunchy feel.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m stuck with this messy mane</li>
            <li> Not toweled dried, WET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a curly haired girl it helps to retain curl shape and style all day, without being crunchy or stiff.</li>
            <li> However, when I use Climate Control Gel and let it airdry, things don&#x27;t look bouncy and tight but they still look defined and UN-frizzy!  </li>
            <li> If you read the other reviews I noticed that at least three of the reviews were poor due to the fact that this product made their hair \\&quot;too curly!\\&quot;  Isn&#x27;t that what this was designed for?</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money!</li>
            <li> my hair, which normally has a halo of fuzzy frizz in humidity, would, at worst, curl and wave (which it does naturally).</li>
            <li> Small sections at a time, apply the gel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good with this products</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, hard to tame, frizzy thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it frizzes terribly without product.  </li>
            <li> because I can&#x27;t find something that&#x27;ll not make my curls hard.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve learned the hard way!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curly girls, we know how hard it is to find a product that works.</li>
            <li> If you use the gel alone it will get hard feeling.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was shocked that my hair felt so dry after using this.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the natural oils that I have used for years and will sadly look at this expensive product in my vanity for years to come.</li>
            <li> I use my Zotos Acclaim Performance Mousse that I have used since the late 80&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that after years of straightening tends to get frizzy with just about anything I put in it to define the curls.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended my a friend whose daughter has a similar hair type, but it made my daughter&#x27;s 3a/3b hair so dry and frizzy. Try the just natural frizz control hairline, expensive but do you really want to put a price on beauty?</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product. I have frizzy hair, so at the end of blow drying my hair, when it&#x27;s still a bit damp, I run some of the Ouidad through my hair and it makes it more smooth. Great for hot humid summer weather! I&#x27;m ready for August!</li>
            <li> I started using Ouidad products when I wore my hair in its natural curl.  Now I have it straightened but I still use it.  It washes out and doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.  It provides style but when you brush your hair the next day, you can&#x27;t tell it is there.</li>
            <li> For someone that has very curly hair that frizzes in the rain or humidity, this product is wonderful.  All you need to do is add a small amount to hair before blow-drying or letting your hair dry naturally.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old daughter has long and very curly hair with a considerable amount of frizz. We live in the Chicago, Il area and drove 27 miles to the Cheveux Salon in Glen Ellyn, Il. The Cheveux salon has ceritified Ouidad stylists. My daughter received a deep treatment, a cut using the carve and slice Ouidad method, style and a lesson in styling her hair. This was very pricy but with that being said before this day I never heard my daughter say \\&quot;I love my hair\\&quot;. She has always longed for straight hair and hated her hair.    She was taught the proper way to use the Ouidad products. I was surprised to see how much gel the stylist recommended to use. Although I was skeptical about how my daughter&#x27;s hair would turn out after being saturated in the gel. When it was all over and dry, her hair was beautiful. I recommend seeing a Ouidad stylist in your area if you have one available because I would have never applied that much product to anyone&#x27;s hair. It wasn&#x27;t applied like gel at all more like conditioner. Like I said If I hadn&#x27;t seen the stylist do this with my own eyes and see the wonderful results I would have NEVER applied the gel like this.    We purchused the Climate control heat &amp; humidity gel and some of the other Ouidad products from the salon couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Our search for the perfect products is over.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked in Miami during 4th of July weekend. Impressive!</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and was skeptical prior to my first attempt at using it.  I have thick curly hair that after years of straightening tends to get frizzy with just about anything I put in it to define the curls.  This product did a better job of producing uniform curls with just a light scrunching than any product I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for at the salon.  It is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it crunchy at all.  I didn&#x27;t find that the humidity control worked any better than any of the other expensive brands. However I can also attribute that to the fact that I tried it in the middle of a rainy fall in Seattle!  I love this and am currently purchasing a full size bottle.    One final note- If you read the other reviews I noticed that at least three of the reviews were poor due to the fact that this product made their hair \\&quot;too curly!\\&quot;  Isn&#x27;t that what this was designed for?</li>
            <li> Curly girls rejoice! Use this product on wet hair and let dry naturally.... NO FRIZZ, it WORKS!!!  Highly reccomend, I have baby fine wavy hair(very prone to frizz)this just lets the hair curl and wave with shine and no crunch!!  expensive, but worth it, worth it.</li>
            <li> i have pretty curly hair and like to wear it curly, so i&#x27;m always on the prowl for the perfect curl product. i&#x27;d heard about ouidad for a while and ordered the gel and spray from the infomercial (and just canceled the automatic enrollment later). for those of us with curly hair, we know there are all different kinds of curls and well, this just didn&#x27;t suit my type. it didn&#x27;t make it crunchy, which i liked, but it just made it WAY too curly. like shirly temple curly. and i&#x27;m 25 yrs old; that&#x27;s not exactly the look i&#x27;m going for. after applying the product, i ended up taking a flat iron to my curls to soften them out a bit. it&#x27;s not all THAT bad and i&#x27;ll continue to use it since well, i purchased it, but i much rather prefer products like Aquage curl cream, which is the best product i&#x27;ve found for my curly hair to date (they have this on Amazon as well if you&#x27;d like to check it out).</li>
            <li> Love it.  Humidity is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> I have type 3b/3c hair with high porosity.  It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it frizzes terribly without product.  I live in a humid climate (DC) and I need a gel that can really keep my hair looking nice.  I first started using this gel in 2000, when I grew out a relaxer.  It worked well for me, but always mixed with another gel to weigh my hair down a bit (I like to reduce curl, not enhance).  I stopped using Climate Control in 2006, when I decided to do a Japanese treatment to straighten my hair.  Beginning in 2009, I grew out the TR and finally cut off all my relaxed hair last month.  So I&#x27;m a long time user of Ouidad Climate Control who went back to it due to a return to curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouidad Climate Control helps my hair handle humidity.  But I still get some frizz by the end of the day.  I find that it isn&#x27;t a good stand alone gel, as it doesn&#x27;t give me the definition I like.  I like to use it in conjunction with another gel so that I get well defined curls - these days, it&#x27;s LA Looks Sport Gel.  So I will use a leave-in conditioner in the shower, seal with coconut, apply the Ouidad Climate Control and THEN apply the LA Looks for definition.  When I use the Ouidad on its own, I tend to get stringlets and they get really crunchy.  This way, I can use just enough gel for the humidity benefit but get my definition elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good gel.  At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t work on its own as a curl definer.  Also, if you follow the Curly Girl method, be aware that there is a non-water soluble silicone towards the bottom of the ingredient list (dimethicone).  I do follow Curly Girl, but I modify it by shampooing with a non-sulfate shampoo on occasion to avoide cone buildup.  For those who are protein sensitive, this gel isn&#x27;t for you either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013 UPDATE:  After some time using the Curly Girl method (no sulfates, no silicones) I am back to using this product.  Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition is no longer silicone free.  Ever since then, the Curly Girl method has been a flop.  I couldn&#x27;t find another conditioner that gave me good results and I was struggling with frizz.  After a lot of experimenting, I decided to give Ouidad Gels another look.  I tried both the Climate Control and the Curl Quencher.  Climate Control is a great gel for me.  I find that 2 parts Climate Control and 1 part LA Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  It really eliminates frizz, isn&#x27;t too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.Ever since then, the Curly Girl method has been a flop.

            <li> I have extremely thick &amp; curly hair. After reading so many of the great reviews, I bought this product and used it exactly as instructed with very poor results. In fact, my regular VO5 moose and Redken hair lotion worked 10 times better than this product. My hair was left dry and curls frizzy after using Ouidad. Maybe it works for thinner curly hair, but very thick hispanic hair this product does not live up to its promise.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far for controlling my usually-uncontrollable curly hair. In humidity, my hair goes haywire. Climate Control tames it, and although it&#x27;s still curly, it&#x27;s not frizzy. I recommend it highly. Of course, if you love your curls, this will enhance them with a few scrunches.</li>
            <li> I have used many gels in the past but this is the best. It is light weight and thin so it does not weigh my hair down like other gels.</li>
            <li> THIS IS IT&amp;#62; my daughter found this for me.  I have a major collection of sprays, argon and jojoba oil and general goo for my hair. I would cruise the “Ethnic “ hair isle regularly (Im Irish). I never use a brush, only wide combs. When I was young, it was auburn and curly. Now Im “mature” and color my hair, it frizzes immediately and trying to straighten it just makes it worse, hot rollers look great for an hour and then worse again.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the first day I used it I had several people at work say my hair looked “really good”  in a surprised voice.  It  doesn’t guk up, hair stays soft.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I like using this.  I need all the help I can get with the frizzies.  I live in Louisiana and the humidity is terrible.  This really seems to help.</li>
            <li> My daughters have thick, curly hair and they swear by the Ouidad products.  We live in Utah where the dry climate can make for interesting challenges with curly hair</li>
            <li> Both my son and I use this for our massively thick, wavy hair. It&#x27;s light weight, not sticky, and gives your hair shine and hold all day whether you air dry it or style with hot tools. Pricey but an 8.5 oz. bottles lasts for months. Use a bit more on dry hair; just a pea size drop, combed through for wet hair. If you comb it through and want your hair to dry curly, just wrap your head in a terry hair turban after combing product through. Leave on for 5-10 minute, gently scrunch with fingers and don&#x27;t touch your hair till it&#x27;s dry. You can use a diffuser dryer on low if you want it to dry more quickly. Just hold and lift carefully to keep you curls.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this product on t.v. because I can&#x27;t find something that&#x27;ll not make my curls hard. Well this product definitely doesn&#x27;t make your curls hard because it doesn&#x27;t even work! After I applied the gel and the spray it was as if I hadn&#x27;t even put anything in my hair and it was so frizzy. I thought my hair might be too curly so I tried in on my little sister in law that has wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything for her either. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone likes this product because it does nothing to your hair! Biggest waste of money! Stick with store gel!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that controls my huge, frizzy hair! I&#x27;ve tried tons of other gels and now I only buy this one, I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles so far because I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. Its absolute perfection: no frizz, perfectly defined curls, and my hair doesnt puff up after a day. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I dont have curly hair (wavy) but I tried it anyways and now Im in love!  I have shoulder length hair. I use a quarter size amount on damp hair then I blow dry. Wow my hair is shiny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Ulta. This is the only Ouidad product that works for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried their shampoo and it tangled my hair sometime aweful and conditioner was meh.,no slip. I decided to give it one more chance and this has slip and held my curls. I will be honest. I did use grapeseed oil first then this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is not curly, it&#x27;s straight, but in the humid south it frizzes and looses it&#x27;s smooth shine.  Not with Ouidad Climate Control.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length, layered, thick, but fine.  Using this product protects my hair from the heat of my blow dryer and leaves it with a nice healthy shine.  My hair stays frizz free even on the most humid of days.  This is one product I won&#x27;t be without!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to go to a OUIDAD Certified Salon and have the haircut designed for naturally curly hair.  My hair curls tightly so that wasn&#x27;t the issue for me.  My issue was that though many products &#x27;work&#x27; on my hair, they mostly just leave it dry and unmanageable after a few hours which means I was washing my hair everyday if I wanted it to stay curly.  I also had a few bad haircuts so I was all burned out on thos too.  I went to the salon and she walked me through every step of the process from how sh cut my hair (and why) to applying products and I was pleased with the results.  The next day however I was convinced it was a waste of money because I simply couldn&#x27;t make it look like she did so I despaired a wee bit.  I went back home and a few days later, I decided to give it another try.  I used my normal shampoo and while it was wet, I applied the Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel, only I did it my way.  The stylist used a method called rake and shake which separated each curl and gave me a Shirley temple look (which I wasn&#x27;t in love with as a woman over 40) so I decided to apply the product as she told me to (which is amply and in manageable sections) but I didn&#x27;t use the rake and shake method and it worked BEAUTIFULLY!!  It has been a month and I am still in love with this product and very happy with the way the work on my hair.  I have read many of the comments, both positive and negative, and I am sure this product won&#x27;t work for everyone (nothing ever does) but I am a huge fan thus far and recommend it to anyone with mostly curly hair.  If you live in the Denver area go to \\&quot;More than Curly Salon\\&quot; in Aurora ... the people there are professional and are committed to educating and empowering the curly hair community (one curl at a time ... cheesy yes, but so true).  Oh and one more thing, she told me to use this product for summer and that in the winter, when the humidity goes away, I can switch to the Curl Quencher line which is great for dryer climates.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review Amazon products because I buy SO much on Amazon - it would take forever.  I had to say something about this Ouidad product, however. My hair has been a frizzy mess for 53 years. Living in hot, humid Houston takes a huge toll on any style, but my hair absolutely can&#x27;t function. I have spent hundreds trying to find hair products that will keep it from frizzing up when I walk out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS on humidity. I used it for the first time this morning and have looked in the mirror probably 50 times because I can&#x27;t believe how soft and sleek my hair is! It&#x27;s almost 100% humidity outside with a 60% chance of rain and 90 degrees.  I&#x27;ve been out most of the morning and my hair still looks like it did when I styled it this morning. Too weird (and too cool) given what I&#x27;ve been used to for all these years. I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it!!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  It is essential for anyone with curly hair.  Really helps with the frizz and seems to encourage the curl, so it seems curly, not straggly.</li>
            <li> Too greasy even with a couple of drops. Didn&#x27;t like how it weighed down my hair. Had to wash my hair again. Tried it again with less and it was still greasy.</li>
            <li> Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz.. it didnt hold a curl.. HMMMM not for me</li>
            <li> For a naturally curly haired gal living in an area where humidity is a huge battle in the summer, this is by far the best product I have used! It helps my curls keep their shape without any heavy, greasey, crunchy feel. It is fantastic and I highly reccommend to all my curly haired sisters!!</li>
            <li> My curls never looked so good.  It&#x27;s not sticky or stiff, just great light curls.  A little really goes a long way, so this bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  I first used it at the Ouidad Salon in Santa Monica and had to buy it.  Works better on curly hair than any other gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> be careful...if you use too much product your hair does not curl&lt;br /&gt;just clumps together...use it with a little bit of moraccean oil</li>
            <li> I bought this gel even though it is way overpriced because of the great reviews. This gel made my hair frizzier than if I didnt use any. It also made my hair look and feel like straw in one use. This is the worst gel I have tried so far and since trying the curly girl method, I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom. She is a hair product freak and she really likes. She has very curl hair and Ouidad it is the brand for this type of hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural curly hair down here in Houston Texas! Only need a dime size,  lays a long time</li>
            <li> This product is OK but not as good as its sister product, Botanical Boost. It somewhat control frizz but no better than other products intended for that use for less money. I will buy the Botanical Boost again, but likely will not buy this.</li>
            <li> horrible product and horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and tried alot of different products and even worked for a multinational health &amp; beauty company but never come across such a great product as this.  Seriously, look no further Ouidad has now made it a pleasure to have curly hair.  It&#x27;s brilliant and I could not think of purchasing anything else.    I just hope that Ouidad expands into other markets so I can get it beyond USA.</li>
            <li> When it is hot as hades outside it keeps my hair from looking like someone shook the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, feels light and keeps the frizz at bay!  This worked well in Virginia and Arizona!  Buy it without delay!</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other products and came back to Quidad.  My fine hair frizzes so easily in the Georgia heat.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but lots of it and lately it&#x27;s really affected by humidity.  This product really helps.  There is nothing that works all the time, but I found this to be the best.</li>
            <li> this product is great for controlling my frizz compared to this company moisturizing curl quencher gel. It keeps curls in place. Just a drop on each parting after co washing my hair works to keep things under control. My hair also stopped getting greasier and heavy since my old products weighed my hair down. Would really recommend for efficiency and frizz control.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Someone recommended this to me to help with my curls. I don&#x27;t think it does anything more than other products out there. My hair still is frizzy when it dries. I don&#x27;t have defined curls like I thought I would with the recommendation.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mistake, I usually buy another of the Ouidad products but found I like this one more.  I also found that a little goes a long way and I could get away with using less for a good hold on my fine curly hair, although I still need the finishing gel to release the crunchies.  Works great and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love this product! i was sick and tired of curl cremes that were thick and sticky this is light weight and feels like you have nothing in your hair! Its so soft and manageable plus it takes all the frizz away!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing but there is a certain way you have to apply it ... If I don&#x27;t apply it to small sections at a time it doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a product. I also have to diffuse my hair because I can&#x27;t stand it wet but I have to diffuse it at a low heat and low power setting. It takes a little longer but thee results are worth it. I do this for special events. Found this link extremely helpful:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I live in a pretty humid place so this works!</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my curly hair.  Ouidad is the best!</li>
            <li> Best product to curt your hair. leave it nice and soft- style last three days just add a lil water and is back to looking fabulous</li>
            <li> Even controls my frizz in the Miami humidity! A must-have for anyone with curls. It was recommended to me by my stylist at a Ouidad salon which used a specific method of taming the curls, creating a healthy frizz-free head of hair.</li>
            <li> slimy. possibly a lot of silicon in it.</li>
            <li> Oh where would I be without this terrific product? I am a die hard Ouidad fan, and this is one of their main staples and best sellers in their flagship salon that I frequent. It&#x27;s their base product that helps create all the &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; This is better than any ordinary hair gel - light weight, not heavy nor sticky. As a curly haired girl it helps to retain curl shape and style all day, without being crunchy or stiff. A must have for any curly girl who does not want to look like they have a &#x27;fro.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price. You have to use so much and the results aren&#x27;t great. I always wear my down in front and I got acne all over my chest. It was so ugly. My hair looked ok but I wanted to hide my chest. On days I wear my hair up I will use this just Bc it was 22 dollars. Would not purchase again. Lady&#x27;s with curls check out catwalk and trendstart amplifier, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> i dont have very curly hair so i need product to maintain my curls and thsi is a good product but i have to add mousse and spray in order to maintain my curls all day.</li>
            <li> It does help remove frizz and add shine.  It always gets crinkly on my hair and my hair takes much longer to dry with this in it. You can get rid of the crinkly, after the hair is dry, by using the Clear Control Pomade.  I&#x27;m not very good with this products so I don&#x27;t do the whole thing nearly as well as my hair cutting person.  I actually hate doing the whole process, but I give it 4 stars because it does make my hair look better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  You do have to use a lot of this Gel if you have a lot of hair, like I do.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works in my curly hair. It leaves my hair soft but defines my curl while controlling frizz. I hate paying the money but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I will use in my hair.  I have thick, naturally curly hair.  This gel is light but gives my curls a great hold that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Like most people with curly, frizzy, fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to find a solution for that frizz -- especially on humid days. Ouidad products are the solution for me, especially used in combination. This particular product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found for hot, humid summer days. I like to use it in tandem with the Ouidad Shine serum -- great combination.</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair and this product worked excellent!! My twist out was almost perfect. Thanks quidad!!</li>
            <li> Dionysia&#x27;s daughter-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly 3A hair. I find this product works pretty well, but it didn&#x27;t provide me the &amp;#34;humidity-proof&amp;#34; results I was expecting based on other reviews. I took it with me when I went to Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, hoping this would control the frizz from the humidity, but it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot but weigh random parts of my hair down. I gave up on it and wore my hair in a big ol&#x27; soft afro-poof most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that this is a definitely a gel, and gels don&#x27;t work that well for me in any right, so I&#x27;m not too surprised. This is a liquid-y gel and it does have some hold. It also is kinda sticky so wash your hands afterwards. If there was a smell, it&#x27;s pretty mild and won&#x27;t interfere with any other scents you may be wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product probably works pretty well for other people, but for me it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> As one who spends most of my time in high humidity, this product is an absolute must have! Buy it before summer humidity hits!</li>
            <li> Very cool product for curly hair.  Product goes a long way.  Hair stays soft, unlike gels that can give the hair a crunchy feeling.  We also use the conditioner for washing and as a leave in.</li>
            <li> If you need curl definition and humidity resistance this is the product for you. I live in hawaii which is super humid and I get NO frizz with this product</li>
            <li> This gel worked well on my naturally curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it worked any better than other gels I have tried.  It left my hair crunchy, which I don&#x27;t care for.  I wish the consistency was conducive to putting it into a spray bottle and applying it that way instead of just running it through my hair with my hands.</li>
            <li> I could write sonnets about how deep my love is for this product.  I have fairly curly hair, and have always struggled between the frizzy, wild-woman look with no product, vs. the crunchy, wet-look of gels and mousse.  This stuff is amazing.  Great hair days every time I use it...and bonus:  it still looks great the next day.</li>
            <li> LOVED ALL THE QUIDAD PRODUCTS, BUT COULD NOT AFFORD THEM.  WISH I HAD COUPONS FOR PURCHASING THEM.&lt;br /&gt;OR A LOWER PRICE POINT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is far the best climate control product for my hear that I ever had.I would give 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Best Gel ever...Don&#x27;t buy nothing but Ouidad. There products are the best for curly hair. And trust me I have tried many, many products on the market. Highly recommend if you have curly hair!!</li>
            <li> I have been using MyDevaCurl products for almost a year and thought that the gel was working for me.  However, I discovered Ouidad a few months ago and am in love with this product.  Seriously, it made my curls shiny and they feel so light. They don&#x27;t look crunchy, but they&#x27;re well defined.  Try the Ouidad rake &amp; shake method with this product and I think you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Botanical Boost, did absolutely nothing for my curly hair.  Looks exactly the same as it always did even after using it several times.  Just a gimmick!</li>
            <li> I use the Ouidad Rake &amp; Shake technique and blow dry using a diffuser.  It helps me to mix it a little with Ouidad Tress Effects but Climate Control works great by itself too.  I also use the Ouidad hairspray mist to &#x27;set&#x27; my curls and the mist helps my hair dry faster.  Just apply the Climate Control, rake &amp; shake until your curls are set the way you want them, mist with the hairspray, blow dry.  Then using your fingers when hair is completely dry, arrange your curls if they need it.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I am now swearing by it!!!!  I live in the caribbean and this gel goes a long way (you only need a nickel sized amount for each section of hair) and the no frizz action lasts for days!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have naturally curly hair and finally I found a product that I love.  It helps so much with humidity and making the curls fall better.  I love how it doesn&#x27;t look like a gel in your hair but goes in wet.  It is the best product for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Gread gel for us curly hair girls.  I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received is in a different packaging than what is shown, and different then the dozen or so previous bottles I have purchased. This causes me to be concerned whether I received the genuine product, or perhaps with her I received a very old bottle.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 years, and I don&#x27;t even have curly hair. My daughter has been using for 3 years and both of us would never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> The product was processed and shipped very quickly. This is my 1st time using Quidad products. I originally followed their directions for styling, but found that my hair type needs a be worked with a little differently. When I went back to my old styling method, it worked a lot better. It is a great product to keep the curls soft. However, I still needed to use another product with it to ensure a stronger hold as I have some curls that become more like waves by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This product is great in the Wisconsin summer months. My hair is thick, fine, and tends to curl. This product does not prevent the curling, but it allows my hair to become less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Came very fast. i have really curly frizzy hair and this definitely helps to keep it under control. it does have a sort of wet look to it though.</li>
            <li> Found a video on YouTube by VeronicaMeza titled \\&quot;How to Style Naturally Curly Hair\\&quot;. She used this product with incredible results.  I purchased this Gel, from Amazon, and followed her instructions to the letter. Even all the head flipping and hair twirling. This is the first time in my life that I had no, and I mean no frizz. My hair came out soft and crazy full of body.  I still had a headful of beautiful curls the next day after dancing, drinking and sleeping.  I will be a life time customer of this product and plan to try other products in this line.  Since the video I saw was so helpful to me I&#x27;m including the URL for those interested.  [...]</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  There is nothing better for my curly hair - and that&#x27;s even in the damp humidity of Florida where I live now!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I have spent years (and lots of money) looking for something that would help tame my hair. My hair has not gone frizzy since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I live in a forest in the mountains, and our humidity is always 85-100%. It does not flake at all.  I was just using this with my regular shampoos, but bit the bullet and bought the shampoo and conditioner to try to see if it made any difference.  I don&#x27;t know why it does, but using all three products together makes my hair so much nicer looking.  If you have been looking for a product for your naturally curly  hair, this is it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for curly haired people livening in Florida..keeps the frizz to a minimum. Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this in teh winter months and I really like how it feels as I apply it. It isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky at all. Helps with my super frizzy hair. I live in Houston humidity so I recommend this if you are having hair issues due to weather.</li>
            <li> The best product for my hair. Really helps with frizziness. My 2nd bottle.&lt;br /&gt; Just wish it costed less. My hair is very long &amp; thick, so this bottle is used up quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best frizz tamer I&#x27;ve found. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or yucky feeling and curls stay nice for up to three days between washing.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I have been using for years. I use daily. I&#x27;ve moved on to other hair brands but for GEL and deep treatment, I stayed with OUIDAD. My hair is curly, long. I have psoriasis. The product doesn&#x27;t flake-up or irritate my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use minimal product on DAMP hair, maybe a dime size through the top/scalp part of my hair and same dose through the length-to tips of my hair. I feel it tones down the frizzies, keeps my hair more intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crispy.&amp;#34; When I&#x27;m staying indoors, I&#x27;m happy with the result. On outdoors, when I went tourist exploring on vacation in Vegas heat, I was still happy with results. If you&#x27;re going outdoors, and you&#x27;re really going to work up a sweat, it&#x27;s not going to hold, I get a lot of top frizzies/if hair is pulled back and I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give hair that &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34; up look, still looks more natural. If you want a STRONGER, more apparent gel look, I&#x27;d suggest Biologe, which doesn&#x27;t flake-up either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this formula never changes.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what this naturally frizzy head of hair needed. It controls and manages my frizz whether I&#x27;m wearing my hair straight or curly. The best frizz management I&#x27;ve encountered to date.</li>
            <li> There is finally a product for curly hair that really works. It doesn&#x27;t way down my curls but my ringlets keep their shape without feeling crunchy. Soft, beautiful hair, what more can you want.</li>
            <li> I love this product - its my favorite curly hair product. Don&#x27;t even need to use hair spray for control. I was impressed on how fast I received it.</li>
            <li> The missus really likes this and keeps going back for more, so that&#x27;s about as good a recommendation as one can give.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years directly from Ouidad, it&#x27;s always been great, and I was delighted to find it on Amazon. When it arrived though, it seemed to be a different consistency than the normal product, very thin and not as viscous as usual. Not only that, it was if I hadn&#x27;t put any product in my hair at all. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I love the ouidad line</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 2c/3a, thick and very frizz prone. Combine that with the hot, humid southern summer and it&#x27;s a recipe for disastrously huge hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only frizz fighting procust I&#x27;ve found that consistently works very well. Tames my unruly hair without making it feel like I have lots of product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on buying more! Good value and didn&#x27;t have to drive to the store to get it.</li>
            <li> not really....it does not works</li>
            <li> Works great on my frizzy, fine hair, even on hot and humid days! Not an overpowering scent either</li>
            <li> awesome for curly hair, arrived fast!</li>
            <li> For my hair, this is nothing short of a miracle product.  If Ouidad ever stopped making it, I would be lost.</li>
            <li> For as much money as I paid for this I will not be buying again. It dried out my hair I had to use an immense amount of product in order to gain any control. I have extremely coarse curly hair, so if you have less coarse hair you may have better luck than I did. It also has a very synthetic chemical smell.</li>
            <li> First I have to say that if you are going to purchase this product to try it for the first time buy it from the company website. They have a 30 day full money back guarantee of you don&#x27;t like it. So far this product has done well. I have a wavy/curly hair mix. I don&#x27;t get a crunchy texture from it as others have stated. Maybe they just didn&#x27;t distribute it evenly. The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it didn&#x27;t take away as much frizz as I was hoping. It does take away a good bit of it, but I usually have to follow up with some coconut oil to calm my hair down the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> Yes! It does stop the frizz, even in humid climates and in the rain.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this stuff that I used on a trip to Disney World (in September). At the time I&#x27;d started using several new products so I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making the difference, but my hair, which normally has a halo of fuzzy frizz in humidity, would, at worst, curl and wave (which it does naturally). It was actually a better product for letting my naturally wavy hair do what it wants to do and look nice than anything I&#x27;d used, and if I used an iron it would keep it smooth, and either way, NO FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without intense humidity, it makes my hair significantly more manageable. After the sample ran out I realized it had been the difference, since I didn&#x27;t have a single good hair day without it. Keeps it smoother, holds style better, and much more tolerant of my terrible hair dryer. Just got this full bottle, and I&#x27;m sitting here playing with my hair nonstop. Normally my hair is like straw the day I blow-dry it unless I use tons of oils and silicone-based products, but I used only this and a bit of mousse and its light, smooth, silky (but not fake shiny), and looks incredibly healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest anyone with frizzy, unruly hair try this and switching to a cleansing conditioner (like Wen, but there are cheaper versions). For the first time in my life, I love my thick, wavy hair without having to burn it into submission with an iron. I live in Savannah so the product gets put through the ringer fairly often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had curly hair my whole life....I hate it.But since I&#x27;m stuck with this messy mane I call my hair, I have to do what I can to make my hair look like...HAIR!! And not a big ball of fur.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t had luck with this product, chances are you are missing one crucial point. YOUR HAIR HAS TO BE SOPPING WET WHEN YOU APPLY THIS PRODUCT. SOPPING WET...DRIPPING WITH WATER. Small sections at a time, apply the gel...more is more. AIR DRY. That&#x27;s right...absolutely no heat styling at all. Curly hair doesn&#x27;t like hairdryers. It&#x27;s like Jacob the werewolf and the vampire guy from Twilight. You know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried tons of stuff. If I told you how much money I spent on hair products you&#x27;d think I was insane. Only a few brands have worked for me. Rusk (specifically Rusk Thermal Serum) and John Frieda (Thermal Shine Serum) and Ouidad. These brands specialize in curly or frizzy hair. Deva products don&#x27;t impress me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a crunch problem with this product, it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s totally normal. But just rake it out with your fingers very gently. The crunchy wet look will go away. And the best part is that if you need to reactivate this gel, you don&#x27;t have to add more, you just have to wet your hair just a bit and you&#x27;ll notice a slippery feeling. That&#x27;s the gel reactivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product a lot. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but I&#x27;m actually saving myself from frustration and really, really REALLY bad hair days. Also, think about all the mediocre products you&#x27;ve bought and how that surpasses the price of this one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped. This is just my opinion. Need me to clarify anything? Just comment! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and you can only order it online.</li>
            <li> Best product for my curly hair !!!:) My hair is curly type 3 a (S pattern) and this gel really helped define my curls !!!!!</li>
            <li> great for super frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Love the way it calms frizz and makes styling curly hair easier!  Oidad products were developed with real curly hair issues in mind.</li>
            <li> Hands down - this is the best hair gel I have EVER used.  I am African-American, I am completely natural (no relaxer or hair color on my hair), and have thick, coarse 3c/4a hair.  If applied after washing my hair, his gel defines my curl pattern and keeps it intact long after my hair dries.  I have used it for years, and every time I try a &#x27;new&#x27; product, it is never as good, and I end up going back to Ouidad Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using ouidad climate control gel for about 3 years now and I love it. It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry out and let&#x27;s me keep my curls for a few days. It feels gentle and soft on my hair and helps define my curls easily. Just pea sized amount is enough for my entire head of hair, therefore the bottle lasts a long time. I am glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly, frizzy, slightly dry hair and bought this gel to use on my trip to Hawaii. As I&#x27;m sure you know, Hawaii is notorious for the humidity and my hair is not used to all that since I live in the scorching, unforgiving desert that is Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was preparing for my vacation, visions of me stepping off the plane with a puff ball on my head haunted me amidst my fantasies of white sand beaches and hunky Hawaiians. I prayed that this gel would be the saving grace needed to achieve the miracle of avoiding frizz. I bought Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil leave-in conditioner (which I also loved!), some raw coconut oil, and this climate control gel to make sure my hair stayed hydrated and contained. Not only did my hair not frizz, but my hair was so beautifully defined! This gel revealed curls I didn&#x27;t know my head was capable of sprouting; every curl was like a Shirley Temple ringlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved the consistency of this gel - it&#x27;s not sticky, thick, or goopy at all. It&#x27;s very thin and like liquid, so be careful when you first use it as I got way too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: This is one of my new holy grail products. My hair loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> only product that I have found that makes curls out of frizz. down side is that it only lasts one day. Have to wash, apply every day. However it is still good when I don&#x27;t have time to do curlers etc. A curler set lasts for a week. so this product is good when I can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I have curly hairs. After reading many reviews I thought this gel would be fine for me. But after using this product my hairs are becoming dry and losing shine.</li>
            <li> Ouidad is my favorite hair care line ever. Finally, a gel that works with my thick, naturally curly hair, which, like me, does what it wants and usually doesn&#x27;t behave. This gel helps tame the frizz, define my curls and retain moisture without making my curls &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I also use a lot less of this than inexpensive store brands. My hair doesn&#x27;t quite reach my shoulders, but it is very thick. I used to use a palm full of product in an attempt to tame those curls. But I use less than a quarter-size dollop of this, usually mixing with a similar amount a leave-in conditioner. Curly hair typically doesn&#x27;t get shiny but this gel adds a bit of shine. I live in a tiny town in a very rural area of Iowa, so Amazon is a great option for hard-to-find products for hard-to-control hair.</li>
            <li> Ouidad Climate Control is the only product that can tame my curly hair.  I have been using it for many years and would never be caught without it.  I have tried many products but this is the only one that works for me.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a bit too heavy and sticky for my hair, no matter how little I used.  I like other products in their line, so I think this gel just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> work really good ! rk really good diffine curl must have it hold the curl for about 3 days great great product! love it</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually controls my thick curls. Keep trying to find less expensive solutions but I always come back to this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It works well with keeping the curls in shape without getting too crunchy. It really has made a difference to my big hair.</li>
            <li> This totally works for my hair. I have been hearing about Ouidad products since I stopped chemically processing my hair in 2007, but the reviews always seemed so mixed, I thought I&#x27;d just pass on buying any; boy, am I glad I decided to revisit the idea!! I have curly, mixed race hair, (my texture is 3C with some 4A on the sides, for those of you in the natural hair community) and I have frizz issues, problems getting my curls to look defined, and dryness. Typical for most curlies, right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching many, many, youtube, reviews on this product, I had a gut feeling for some strange reason I should just give it a try. I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has DEFINED my curls, softened my hair, and decreased shrinkage. My curls even remain defined and unfrizzed when I play in it after it&#x27;s dry. Un-freakin&#x27;-believable. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited this long! I just keep looking in the mirror throughout the day, (even in the bathroom at work, lol) in awe of how my curls finally look very close to how I&#x27;ve always wanted them to. And the thing is, my hair HATES gel! Hates it, hates it! The only gel my hair has liked in the 5 years I&#x27;ve been curly is Kinky Curly Curling Custard, and that still doesn&#x27;t define as well as this Ouidad gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read many people&#x27;s reviews complaining that this gel makes their hair dry. I will say, and I&#x27;m sure if you have curly hair, you know this, all products don&#x27;t work for all people; so it&#x27;s very possible that it just may not work with your hair texture. If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s fine. Just keep researching and you will eventually find the product that&#x27;s right for you. It took me over 5 years to find this gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE ARE A FEW TIPS I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TO GET THE BEST RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Except that your hair is your hair, and stop wishing you had the texture or curls of someone else. Also, stop thinking that if you keep looking and looking for that JUST RIGHT product, it will MAKE your hair magically change and become like someone else&#x27;s curls. This is just pure madness. (I&#x27;ve learned the hard way!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Before applying Ouidad gel, your hair must be clean and SOAKING, DRIPPING, wet. Not toweled dried, WET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The next thing I do is apply about 2-3 quarter size amounts of a good, moisturizing leave in conditioner; (you may need less) this is a KEY step to avoid your hair feeling and looking dry when it&#x27;s finally done. I also use this time to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Be generous when applying the product, because it is water based and very light,(kinda like a thin pancake syrup) but not TOO generous or it will flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Finger comb the product through very small sections of hair, (more than four) continuing until all of your hair is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Sit under a hood dryer for 20 minutes to get it about 50% dry, (this helps me decrease shrinkage, and I noticed that they do this quite a bit in the salon after apply finishing products) or just air dry. DO NOT TOUCH OR PLAY WITH YOUR HAIR WHILE IT&#x27;S DRYING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. This gel dries crunchy. After your hair is at least 80% dry, rub a moisturizing serum, oil, or pomade into your hands and distribute throughout your hair, which simultaneously gets rid of that crunchy gel feel. Make sure to turn your head upside down and apply to the back. Now manipulate your curls till you&#x27;re satisfied with the way they look...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Voila! You&#x27;re ready to show yourself to the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone that gives this a try; I hope it&#x27;s works as well for you as it did for me! xoxo</li>
            <li> I recently experienced Ouidad for the first time at my hairdresser. Brand new product for me, never heard of it before....I have thick, curly, hard to tame, frizzy thick hair. This product works without the crunch of typical gels. I could not find it in a store anywhere so  I went to Amazon. Expensive but truly worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick wiry hair. Only downside is that when using this stuff, I have to wash and re-do every day, as I cannot use a curling brush with good effect after using the stuff. So it&#x27;s six of one, half dozen of the other. However, it is the best hair gel I have used for this purpose (one good hair day).</li>
            <li> Curly girls, we know how hard it is to find a product that works. Most of us have tried literally dozens upon dozens of products to try to tame our curls and get us out the door on time. For me this gel does that little miracle in an amazingly effortless fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is lightweight and not sticky but still manages to shape my curls without holding them down. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get crunchy and it does a great job of controlling my summer high humidity induced frizz. All of that and it&#x27;s moisturizing (exactly what my thirsty curls want!) too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this gel after shampooing and applying Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner. Sometimes I even mix the leave-in conditioner and the gel together in my hand before applying for a really soft and sexy head of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for a person who lives in a humid climate and has curls they want to actually curl without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about one year. It works well for me in the summer time. It allows my hair to curl with minimum frizz.&lt;br /&gt;If I use too much my curls get crispy so it was trial and error at first. I do not have really long hair so my hair may not need as much as specified.</li>
            <li> I love buying Ouidad products from Amazon as I know I am getting what I wanted.  Climate Control is awesome and buying it through Amazon is much faster than their the company&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for my naturally curly hair.  It works well and I will use it again.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is in the j-lo territory if j-lo didn&#x27;t have the funds to have her hair perfectly blownout on a daily basis!!  Yeah, we see the sleek Pantene version of j-lo so we&#x27;ve all forgotten the &amp;#34;in living color&amp;#34; version that is actually who she is.  Well, that&#x27;s my hair.  I consider it medium curly with the help of a diffuser and product but left to itself, God help me!  When I try to do the natural thing and let it airdry without product...uh, just bad!!  However, when I use Climate Control Gel and let it airdry, things don&#x27;t look bouncy and tight but they still look defined and UN-frizzy!  It&#x27;s a boho look that works like when you leave the beach.  Even when I use a diffuser with this product my curls don&#x27;t look tight but at least they are defined without frizz and very soft.  I appreciate this and I don&#x27;t.  I have a feeling gel isn&#x27;t what my curls want.  They&#x27;re too loose for something this heavy.  When I use mousse my curls seem happier and bouncier.  Having said that, I still use this stuff on days I want to shower and airdry and know that my hair will look OK.  I&#x27;m sure I have completely confused you now.  I&#x27;m just sayin...it&#x27;s OK, not great!</li>
            <li> Works great on me and my daughters&#x27; hair. We all have natural curly hair and it keeps the frizz under control . Love this product!</li>
            <li> This truly transforms my curls from dry, unruly....to bouncy, shiny, and just gorgeous.  I now have the curls I&#x27;ve always dreamed of and now people envy my hair &#x3D;).  If you have curly hair and you want to rock those curls this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Love it! Adds definition &amp; hold to my curls</li>
            <li> The only gel that give me shiny frizz free curls...I like to soften the ringlets by using the Ouidad pomade after the curls have set by smoothing it onto my hair and squeezing the curls a bit...</li>
            <li> as noted previously, i love the product and the experience, ordering, shipment and charging went without flaws. i will reorder.</li>
            <li> This gel alone isn&#x27;t going to make your unruly curly hair magically become tame... you need the official Ouidad cut. I have VERY curly hair which I kept pulled back in a slick bun for YEARS. I discovered I had a Ouidad salon in my new hometown, so after the birth of my 2nd child... I decided it was time for a change. I cut 13 1/2 inches off my hair so my hair was now just above my shoulders. For anyone with very curly hair, you can imagine how terrifying that sounds. Well, not with the Ouidad cut... I have maintained this cut for almost 2 years now. I only &#x27;do&#x27; my hair every other day and it takes me ~20 minutes to complete. Yes it takes a bit more effort than just pulling it back... but I will NEVER go back again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, tight ringlet hair.  After reading other reviews, I was shocked that my hair felt so dry after using this.  My scalp itched!  It is not the wonder product that I thought it would be.  I will continue to use the natural oils that I have used for years and will sadly look at this expensive product in my vanity for years to come.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. So worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a Latina with frizzy wavy hair and I live on the east coast, which has both weather extremes. It works great year round. I followed instructions on the various you tube videos i watched and they were helpful. I finish the process with the clear pomade and I&#x27;m all set.</li>
            <li> awesome keep my curls and controls the frizzy hair</li>
            <li> This is ok for short term but it quickly loses efficiency after about an hour. I have also noticed some residue from it.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best product ever made for curly hair. It makes your hair frizz free and you have soft bouncy curls. I have tried many products having naturally curly hair and this stuff rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while now and my hairdresser showed me how to use it properly. She did the rake and shake, let the curls dry (diffuser not a lot of handling the hair), at that point I was initially freaked out because it was so stiff. BUT the trick is she put a dollop of the shine glaze serum in her hands and pulled my hair back like she was going to put it in a ponytail, then released it. My curls were PERFECT ringlets and super soft, shiny and bouncy. If you use the gel alone it will get hard feeling. You are basically setting your curls. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I just use the botanical boot, and my hair goes back to soft and curly. It&#x27;s like a freaking miracle! I learned to leave my curls alone otherwise, the more you handle them the more unruly they become. I have been able to duplicate the awesome curls every time doing it the way my stylist showed me. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair product out there for sleek frizz free hair and this is better than the most expensive frizz control and body producing products out there. A gel has never worked for me bc it either got crunchy dry or wet n frizzy- this is an amazing product u work in sections and they really stay bouncy and put all day. Shhh id pay way more for the bottle it last a good month</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is fine and is naturally wavy. This gel gives me curls that hold. Love it!</li>
            <li> If you want great looking curls this is the product to buy. I have head full of thick curly hair, and this product is great...Not only does this fight off the humidity but it helps keep my curls intact. It gives my curls a medium hold, and I love it just because my hair is not crispy like other gels tend to do to my hair. I usually apply about 2-3 quarter sized amounts in my hair, then spread it evenly especially on my ends which always tend to get frizzy. Overall this gel is well worth it, keeps my hair healthy looking and that&#x27;s always a plus in my book!</li>
            <li> Great but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it since 2002 and am such a fan! Soft, manageable curls, even through humid TN and NC summers and can now handle the Pacific Northwest weather year round. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase! I promise! If I run out and have to get something else in a pinch, it is always such a disappointment! Tired of having a cabinet full of curly hair products that don&#x27;t work?? Ouidad Climate Control is your solution!</li>
            <li> This is a nice-smelling, gentle, lightweight product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or cause \\&quot;crunchy hair\\&quot;. It keeps the frizz at bay. I like OGX argan oil defining cream and \\&quot;Kinky Curly\\&quot; better than this product, as this product doesn&#x27;t do as much as the other 2 to clearly define and hold my curls. I won&#x27;t be buying again. I know lots of people love this stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me!</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever for curly hair!  I&#x27;ve tried them all!  This is the one.  leaves my hair frizz free with my curls nicely formed.  No gel feel.!</li>
            <li> I always had such trouble with my wavy hair. It has a mind of its own. I used to spend forever with my flat iron trying to tame it, but i have put my flat iron away since i started using this product. After washing, I run my fingers through my hair and spray on some Ouidad Botanical Boost. I put the gel in my hair, then i scrunch it a little bit and that is all. When my hair dries my waves stay smooth and my hair looks great all day! ...And i am sure yours will too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally curly but also fine..  I found this product unfortunately didn’t do a thing.  I&#x27;m favoring DevaCurl,  but more so jessicurl of natural hold.</li>
            <li> The best hair product for seriously curly hair ever. I have tried practically every product I can get my hands on and this is by far the best! I am finally able to stop searching. It keeps my curls smooth and pretty, even in humid weather. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for curly hair and high humidity areas.</li>
            <li> I only bother to use one product after leaving the shower; this is the only product I have used in decades that make my curls work for me! My hair color is between blonde and light brown, and very thick. This product somehow makes it more manageable and soft. I had never seen this product advertised. I happened to be having a very difficult hair week when I went to see the ocean for the first time and between the salt water beach and hotel shampoo, my hair became a straw like bird&#x27;s nest. I went to a salon run by a single lady, (not a chain store), and she put this product in my hair. It transformed my hair just in time for a family photo. I put off purchasing it due to its high price for five months, but now after using it for a week again, I know it is the right investment for myself. It does not leave my hair crunchy, and I do use more than a nickel size as stated on the bottle because I have very long hair. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this from birchbox.com and LOVED it. I ordered the full size but truthfully I am using it plus additional product. I thought it would be life changing but it is not as great as I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair and after conditioning and using this ouidad I still have some frizz. I am adjusting to a new climate so that could be part of the problem. I am not sure why the sample size worked better, perhaps they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> This product is good for frizzy coarse hair.  Really good for styling and humid conditions.  Great detangled and smells good too</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, very curly hair.  This gel preserves her curls but tames the frizz so she doesn&#x27;t look like Rosann Rosanna Danna!</li>
            <li> Love all Ouidad products</li>
            <li> I have long thick naturally curly (caucasian) hair. I live where it is extremely humid. I discovered this at a upscale salon my sister treated me for my B&#x27;day. &#x27;Ouidad&#x27; is a unique and specialized haircut for curly hair; the hairdresser has to be specially trained at a Ouidad special class. Which the cut is awesome. They also have hair care products. (I don&#x27;t work for Ouidad, promise) Anyone with curly hair appreciates it when someone recommends a product that actually is good, I&#x27;m spreading the love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The product is similar to gel but not as heavy; it penetrates the hair. It is not for a style hold; it controls the &#x27;Frizzes&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;***After washing hair, before the styling product, I apply to my hair after towel drying a bit. I also will apply in-between washes after I dampen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Then I use my Zotos Acclaim Performance Mousse that I have used since the late 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It is on eBay sometimes and here on Amazon. (I almost hate giving up my secret mousse since it is hard to find.) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069CJY1Y/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. No crunchy feeling and it&#x27;s light. Love it</li>
            <li> Love thus stuff especially during the summer !!</li>
            <li> Best ever for unpredictable curls without crunch. I have tried EVERYTHING else and keep coming back to Climate Control.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I would recommend it for anyone who has problems with frizz</li>
    </ol>
