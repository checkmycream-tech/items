    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I NEVER saw her hair look so beautiful!</li>
            <li>This was great!</li>
            <li>But again, it wasn&#x27;t miraculously perfect hair.</li>
            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, my hair feels revitalize</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it&#x27;s best to try it out and find what amount and technique works best for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, but does require a lot of washing!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and this product is a great price!</li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It was awesome.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I will NEVER use another hair product again (except WEN)!!</li>
            <li>but in my opinion there is a reason Wen is twice as much, a very good one at that.</li>
            <li>Great price - great product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so much impressed with this Sally&#x27;s product, I got a discount card (lol, I never buy membership cards).  </li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is awesome because it cools and tingles your scalp, feels so good.</li>
            <li>so I used the Tea Tree formulation - great tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>But I think this would be great for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>She is also happy with her results.</li>
            <li>This does a great job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>, it works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be broke, but my hair will look great.</li>
            <li>but this helps a great deal.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great for not just a weightless conditioner but for your scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report, after 2 washings, that it has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; cleared up my eczema (cradle cap lol) and keeps my hair moisturized here in the desert climate.  </li>
            <li>and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li>It would have been great if this product had worked.</li>
            <li>Product is great.</li>
            <li>I no longer have frizzy fly aways, my hair is manageable, my hair is silky and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am here to buy more Hair One, and I hope this product is never discontinued!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>BUT this review would&#x27;ve been 3 stars if I hadn&#x27;t discovered it&#x27;s magical leave-in properties!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Make sure you comb it through as suggested after working into the scalp for the best results.  </li>
            <li>look forward to seeing what kind of results continued use brings!</li>
            <li>It was just OK, I am still looking for my perfect substitute for WEN products.</li>
            <li>which is remarkable since I have scalp psoriasis</li>
            <li>One my hair felt silky smooth and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>which may be sooner than I would think since I seem to need a good amount of it.</li>
            <li>and I put some spray in to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in a pinch, but that&#x27;s it for me.</li>
            <li>Good substitute for Wen.</li>
            <li>Also tried the jojoba oil &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for color treated hair and it is good too</li>
            <li>Some people think it is a good replacement</li>
            <li>My scalp did feel good and  refreshed</li>
            <li>Maybe this would be good for bouncy curls, but not for kinky curls.</li>
            <li>Good price and value too.</li>
            <li>even after it was rinsed out it burned for a good 10-15 minutes after that.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product but did not meet my needs&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>Also this doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>This type of  product doesn&#x27;t cause scalp irritation on me and works as good as Wen for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I  wish I could have said I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I think it wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It has more body and great managability.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for well over a year now and have been very very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels!   </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it more and with each use my hair became more and more flawless.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>and my hands are feeling better too!</li>
            <li>Love it !  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>It made my scalp feel amazing and got rid of dandruff</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I combine it with</li>
            <li>Great product overall and exceptionally great price!</li>
            <li>WEN is a lot creamier, silkier, and you can FEEL it conditioning your hair and your fingers can glide through your hair so nicely.  </li>
            <li>liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Product smells nice and</li>
            <li>The bottle was not packed in it&#x27;s own box, but just a plastic bag</li>
            <li>This product makes your scalp feel nice and tingly, but I do not like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an itchy/red scalp for close to over a year, it would come and go and to be honest</li>
            <li>Nice conditioning and helps get the stiffness out of my hair.</li>
            <li>smells nice and cleans my hair, but it leaves my hair rather tangled, so i need to use another conditioning product after this, which kind of defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, not too medicinal.  </li>
            <li>I had tried Wen before, and liked the results but did not want to spend $40 on one bottle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was thrilled when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>(side note, I use Living Proof Full and have had really great results).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty incredible</li>
            <li>The smell is VERY strong, it leaves my hair feeling like straw</li>
            <li>It also smells very strongly of Tea Tree oil, and is medicine-y.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed after using Hair One Tea Tree Cleanser and Conditioner how soft and manageable</li>
            <li>And I follow the directions on the bottle, with my own discretion to my hair length and texture.  : )</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean on hair (kind of like Head N Shoulders used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was great.</li>
            <li>And it turned out with some pretty great results for me.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product, so if your budget needs tightening, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Used it on my below shoulder length very fine fair hair and got amazing results on the first wash.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the pump as I think a squeeze bottle would be better suited.  </li>
            <li>I love using this Cleanser conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a must have item for me. :)</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt softer, better conditioned, shinier.  </li>
            <li>Still can&#x27;t get over how healthy</li>
            <li>I have soooo many shampoos and conditioners in my closet.</li>
            <li>It was just better than before.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Hair One for about two weeks now and am quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is growing longer, and it&#x27;s healthy, thicker, shiny, and almost frizz free!   </li>
            <li>my hair is softer and feels better after washing.  </li>
            <li>To help remedy most of it</li>
            <li>4 different races dose  not make for great hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell of the tea tree isn&#x27;t great, but the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay with my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this</li>
            <li>After one use my hair is shiny, smooth and the fly-aways are gone!  </li>
            <li>I thought it smells better then the Wen tea tree, but then again, anything with tea tree oil is going to have that funky smell.</li>
            <li>Compared to Wen Hair One is just OK.</li>
            <li>To achieve closer effects to those achieved with Wen, I had to use a lot more &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34; and leave it in my hair for longer--</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>My scalp still had some itching, but it&#x27;s getting better every week.  </li>
            <li>I love Hair One.</li>
            <li>I love it.it</li>
            <li>My hair seems fuller, shinier, and has more body.  </li>
            <li>and I am really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The color looks better too.  </li>
            <li>The recommendations feel more like a scam for sales to me...</li>
            <li>and we love this line (they use the olive oil variety).  </li>
            <li>It truly is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Ok product.  </li>
            <li>My hair was never terrible</li>
            <li>I love no suds  shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I love the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it, but thought I would try hair.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>After one weeks use I have noticed my hair is softer and has a lot more shine compared to using Wen.</li>
            <li>most ingredients were 1&#x27;s or 0&#x27;s in their safety listing system.</li>
            <li>The results are much better than before.</li>
            <li>this helps :)</li>
            <li>I do like the volume and ease of being able to comb through</li>
            <li>It has never been softer or more healthier.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>She has been using this for about two weeks and asked me to order more, because it works so well.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so safe to use.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many ways to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>I tried it again, a couple more times, assuming, perhaps</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars because, though it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s not necessarily terrible.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I suggest this as more of a conditioner than an all over cleanser.</li>
            <li>Hair one is an okay substitute.  </li>
            <li>my curls, lovely.  </li>
            <li>One curly formula with argan oil will perform better in my hair.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m okay with that, as it did perform as well for me.  </li>
            <li>cause I love tea tree stuff</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Try it! :))</li>
            <li>also want to mention since I see so many people pointing out that this is like Wen but 1/3</li>
            <li>so when you account for the 33% more you get with Wen</li>
            <li>love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to transition yourself from shampoo to this no-poo.  </li>
            <li>It some how feels more healthy.</li>
            <li>and im just now getting better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to add water to emulsify it when using.</li>
            <li>No changes in my hair....except more oily...</li>
            <li>I sure wish WEN could be a bit more competitive with the price.</li>
            <li>After I read through many reviews I decided to give it a try and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen since the beginning of the year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a very nice addition to my regimen to getting my gorgeous hair back.</li>
            <li>some reason, I though it would be a good idea to mix the two together right into the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine, hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good, plus safe to use.  </li>
            <li>It made my scalp tingly and my hair feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Hair always feels very clean.    </li>
            <li>I spend a good 3 minutes rinsing the product out of my hair and make sure I lift the upper layers out of the way so that the under layers get a good rinsing too.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy my hair is to comb after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I knew that tea tree oil had been the most successful out of all of the other attempts, and I saw its good reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something to make it look healthy and smooth.    </li>
            <li>Like Wen, this is a great shampoo for sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way my hair would easily comb through and how much healthier it looked</li>
            <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair - after washing with this cleansing conditioner, my hair was soft and had great volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t end up going with the forty-dollar bottle of Wen, which was originally recommended to</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and does not build up.</li>
            <li>not too strong-</li>
            <li>I like the benefits of tea tree oil, but a lot of the products that have it, tend to smell too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably not bad and may be better than what your using now</li>
            <li>, I noticed a difference in my hair..which is baby fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and will use it once a week.</li>
            <li>this is the best hair stuff i have ever tried it doesnt damage my hair at all like most hair products have in the past</li>
            <li>HairOne smells very good and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; makes your hair feel like pure silk, i barely need to run the comb through my hair because it detangles it so well after cleansing with HairOne and can also be used as a leave in conditioner, which in my case is perfect considering my hair is  very dry!</li>
            <li>This gives me the best combination of healthy-looking, less damaged hair that is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>the price, that isn&#x27;t actually accurate.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something to smooth frizz and help repair damage, I think this is a product you should try.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I did the keratin treatment on my hair and needed a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li>Now that I see how nice this has made my hair and after reading reviews I really want to try Wen now.  </li>
            <li>and I have to use additional products to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d possibly help someone else find a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen for 7 months, and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 days and my scalp/forehead/face was completely free of redness.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has really been effective.</li>
            <li>tea tree oil scent is too light...</li>
            <li>I came across a sulfate free and paraben free tea tree oil shampoo by Nature&#x27;s Gate that I thought was my savoir.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a pleasant odor, you can feel it working on the scalp (not meaning to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s true), and the overall feeling of my hair and scalp was incredible afterwards.</li>
            <li>I bought this in a Sally&#x27;s beauty store for around $11.00 because I ran out of Wen and couldn&#x27;t afford to get more right away.</li>
            <li>Wen, even though it was lather free, it actually left my hair feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that works!!</li>
            <li>It was very much like Wen in my opinion, though it didn&#x27;t smell quite as good and my scalp didn&#x27;t tingle quite as much</li>
            <li>That first day I went onto Amazon to order more and it was no longer available</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>At first, when I was trying this cleanser out, I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will every get Wen (my original intent), but for now, Hair One works for me.</li>
            <li>My hair shows a difference with it, and I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Much better than the higher priced competitor</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>Also, it is too soon to tell for sure, but my first impression is that it is making my hair oilier.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my hair is healthy and you can&#x27;t even tell the years of damage I put it through.  </li>
            <li>Great for my hair which is completely grey.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to discover a non-shampoo cleansing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as thick and creamy as Wen, and doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice.  </li>
            <li>I loved it the first time I used it, although the smell is way too strong (like old woman perfume).  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean and tingly.  </li>
            <li>Several reviews mentioned Hair One, a cheaper but comparable product, so I went with the most cost effective.</li>
            <li>The tea tree is great for my dry scalp</li>
            <li>one week after I made the switch, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>, it seemed to give me a lot of build up on my scalp and my head just did not feel clean.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a clean freak).  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to my three dollar bottle of sulfate-free Trader Joe&#x27;s shampoo and it has been more effective for me.</li>
            <li>It even holds up to 10-mile-run hair and gets me squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Yet my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nine months, and my hair has completely changed for the better!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking too!</li>
            <li>it works really well, and if used right makes the hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair detangled, incredibly smooth, and smelling great (no sulfur smell like some of the other products have).</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t see what so special about it.  </li>
            <li>makes your scalp feel cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>It sooths my scalp and actually dose a good job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>Wen is much richer and thicker and it smells a lot better than Hair One.</li>
            <li>I switched back to using it every day, and it&#x27;s looking good again.  </li>
            <li>In many ways it has been very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try WEN, but saw this product as a more reasonably priced alternative.</li>
            <li>His hair has been very sleek, shiny, and healthy and he has had no dandruff.</li>
            <li>I liked it better than my regular shampoo and conditioner combinations at first, but I also felt the need to use some leave-in product and spray-on oil afterwards because my hair was just never as smooth as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>I did like they said and made sure to rinse really well afterwards, but it still built up in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting blonde highlights in my hair for a good 7 years now.  </li>
            <li>Hair stylist said my hair was healthy and it&#x27;s much cheaper than Wen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nowhere near the level of wen, but it&#x27;s an ok replacement if you run out of wen and can&#x27;t get more right away.</li>
            <li>The 1st use I thought it was ok but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the price, but the 2nd use made a huge impact on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a super sensative scalp.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried Wen you could fall in love with Hair One because it is still a million times better than traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>Luckily it was still easier to comb through</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely buy more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>so I quickly rinsed it out,</li>
            <li>Please post if you find something comparable to WEN at a more realistic price.</li>
            <li>This particular smell is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>my natural red highlights really stand out now and my hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>Using Hair One, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair still looked pretty good by the end of the 2nd day, so I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every 3 days instead.  </li>
            <li>As always, Hair One products make my hair shiny, soft, &amp; twice as beautiful as any regular store bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Literally after the first wash he expressed his scalp felt ten times better with a minty refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>I recently picked up two more bottles of Hair One at Bealls Outlet for $7.99!</li>
            <li>However, that being said, Hair One is a lot better than most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or any of that other junk.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot compare to that, but my hair felt clean and soft and smelled clean!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve started using my Organix sulfate-free shampoo first to clean my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>and I hope you try HairOne and enjoy it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Juanita</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give my hair quite as much volume and doesn&#x27;t leave it as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have since changed to another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and am much happier.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I didn&#x27;t pay as much, should have been a give away.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone and then decided if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>At a fraction of the cost of Wen, its well worth the price and time.</li>
            <li>Maybe ok to use once a week just to clear up your scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a beauty supply store along with a scalp massager and natural bristle hair brush (both are recommended for healthy scalp).</li>
            <li>I even tried using different, more pricey sulfate free shampoos (pureology and redkin).</li>
            <li>It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have been using sulfate free for years, now after rinsing I follow up with Jonathan Antin moisturizing shampoo (sulfate free) and it completely removed the Hair One build up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smooth and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for more natural products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll try my own homemade recipes next time.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but I have very long hair</li>
            <li>of the other reviews also experienced this problem and I can assure you that it has nothing to do with how much you rinse.</li>
            <li>The 2 of us go through one bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>first, the super strength dandruff shampoo helped at bit, but I would still flare up.</li>
            <li>I will re-order WEN instead of buying ONE right now</li>
            <li>I could see a noticeable difference right away.</li>
            <li>Cleans hair and scalp gently, but you need to use it every day to maintain a clean hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair very well and rinses out clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and full of body, and my scalp itch free</li>
            <li>easy to use, leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft, clean, and fragrant!  </li>
            <li>I got positive comments on my hair from people I see every day the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>I guess it really is true that it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair of its much needed oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this product will work great for every type of hair.</li>
            <li>I am so happy it tried it, no more embarrassing flakes</li>
            <li>I thought it was just something I&#x27;d have to live with until I heard someone talk about using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Subsequent washings and using my set routine resulted in all of the above along with great body.</li>
            <li>I need to use so much of it to untangle my hair that it defeats the purpose of its cheaper price because it gets used up so quickly.</li>
            <li>I have since gone on to try Wen, and I very much prefer it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This formula works as well as all the other formulas and has a really great cooling action on my scalp.</li>
            <li>thick, black coarse hair and Wen gives my hair an incredible amount of moisture, volume and best of all makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I had been interested in Wen until reading reviews here and saw that this exists.</li>
            <li>I think I will try the WEN to see if it is literally possible for my hair to look even better than it alreay does.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product if you can&#x27;t afford the WEN!!</li>
            <li>I was interested in purchasing Wen but decided to read some of the reviews before doing so.</li>
            <li>After the first wash with Hair</li>
            <li>At first use, I followed directions on bottle to a T.</li>
            <li>While rinsing product out in the shower I noticed that my hair felt really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I also get a relaxer on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>This worked well on all counts ;)</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of Wen after I ran out of the first one my friend gave me.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The tea tree scent is light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I followed the bottle directions and from the first time using it</li>
            <li>I used to use a spray in leave in detagler/conditioner, which I did not need from the first time using Hair One.</li>
            <li>I use Wen regularly and was looking to purchase more, when I came upon the Hair One products.  </li>
            <li>this is my first product review ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product and ordering on-line saves an extra stop at beauty supply store to purchase it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like my 5 year olds hair again and it feels so natural and light.</li>
            <li>you will fall in love with what it does for you hair and won&#x27;t ever want to go back!</li>
            <li>There are better options for cleansing conditioner in the same price range.</li>
            <li>He used to always use Head and Shoulders and since we&#x27;ve been married (2 years)</li>
            <li>However, I think from now on I&#x27;ll return to the ol&#x27; first shampoo and then condition with two seperate products.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Campho-Phenique, like a medicine smell.  </li>
            <li>When I looked up the product online, however, I decided to instead order Hair One, which I was led to believe would be pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than WEN!</li>
            <li>Yes wen is more pricey but you can buy 16oz or32oz which last about 2 months...</li>
            <li>Overall I do like the product although I would love to try WEN someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to wear it very, very short in order to be able to wash and go.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair felt oily, which is practically the first time in my life my hair has EVER felt oily.</li>
            <li>but when I used this the first time it burned my scalp for a while.  </li>
            <li>I have worn my hair short for most of my 40+ years because I can&#x27;t stand combing it out.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>After the second use, it was even better.</li>
            <li>If I have any symptoms return, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is probably better than your standard shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know which came first.</li>
            <li>First discovered this at Sallys then found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a different, lighter consistency and is more transparent than WEN.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a cleansing wash</li>
            <li>Ingredients listed first are more abundant, and the Hair One ingredient list includes the natural extracts much farther down the list than Wen does.</li>
            <li>I just put on as much as I thought felt right.</li>
            <li>But adding a couple pumps of this on the bottom half of my hair makes my hair look and feel soft, smooth, and healthy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often because I know that it&#x27;s natural oils are good for it, but that also might have been why I didn&#x27;t use this product very long.</li>
            <li>Also, because I style my hair curly (as much curl as you get with a pixie cut), it&#x27;s important for my hair not to be stripped of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Wen left my hair light, soft, and so tangle-free that I can easily run a comb through after the shower (unlike Hair One).</li>
            <li>Hair One is a good alternative and the price is about the same as similar salon shampoos.</li>
            <li>I use much less of the tea tree oil WEN, and my hair and scalp feel sooo much better!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I was concerned that this product would make my hair and scalp greasy, but as long as I take the time to make sure it is all rinsed out, I do not have any problems.  </li>
            <li>After the second use and what really prompted me to write this review is that I had much smoother hair, it styled with ease and looked very hydrated and healthy for the first time in about two years.  </li>
            <li>It took awhile to get here because of a large amazon package I ordered but it was still pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and might try a different formula just to make sure.</li>
            <li>But if you have super curly, kinky, or thick hair with a tendency to frizziness, you&#x27;ll probably love it as I do!</li>
            <li>It definitely is not as conditioning as WEN, but it is a very good alternative if you can&#x27;t afford WEN since it has decent ingredients without the harsh sulfates.    </li>
            <li>The best method I&#x27;ve found for styling my hair is to let it air dry for a while, then blow dry on low heat.</li>
            <li>I love that the dry scalp formula (haven&#x27;t tried others yet)</li>
            <li>after last night&#x27;s usage of this product, I was amazed when looking in the mirror when I saw what appeared to be a normal, healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first, however after using for a couple of weeks my hair began to feel coated and heavy.  </li>
            <li>It has Tea Tree Oil and does not leave my hair oily, but as light and full of volume as the other formulas.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years (including straight olive oil, which is super messy and time consuming), and none have had an impact on the flaking like this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair type is medium to fine, wavy, and I stripped it about three years ago, and had major hair and scalp issues after that, and I had to cut my hair super short.</li>
            <li>I would compare the light feeling to having 3 inches cut off your hair, there is so much stuff built up on your hair from regular shampoos and this just gets rid of it all without stripping out the moisture.</li>
            <li>I was loosing too much hair, and when I switched to Hair One, my hair lose</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read directions until I was in the shower ready to use it, so</li>
            <li>I was really nervous that this product would make my hair feel and look greasy, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that at all.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much.</li>
            <li>But my hair was much more tangeled when wet and felt drier after using a blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions very specifically, it seemed like a lot of work for shampoo;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather but you can feel the formula as it&#x27;s absorbing into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, price and the quality..</li>
            <li>But when you massage it the hair for 2-3 minutes you really begin to feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I am really amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much healthier and it almost looks like I&#x27;ve just had a haircut.  </li>
            <li>Have used this twice, works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t help too much with the dryness.</li>
            <li>I prefer the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Hair One</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Plus you have to use so much</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t damage my scalp as fast, but eventually, I was itching again.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>but i really wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was experiencing a very itchy scalp (no dandruff, just dryness).</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very soothing on my scalp and has a hot/cold/minty feeling while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I tried over 6 products but nothing seems to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find a real difference between the two, except that Wen is thicker.</li>
            <li>I will tell you this: I bought Wen recently because it was $20 with all these extras and free shipping as a promo, and the Hair One performs just as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how my hair came out when used it on my whole head scalp</li>
            <li>I did not find an ingredient list before I made my purchase, simply that it was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>However, it did not moisturize as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>I tried fragrance free shampoos, cider vinegar treatments, coconut oil, simply not using any shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>My complaints with Hair One is that it doesn&#x27;t really help my flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>Hydrates the scalp without too much oily residue</li>
            <li>As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have alot of hair and its pretty curly so finding a good, shampoo &amp; conditioner to keep my hair moisturized has always been a struggle, when looking into Wen i was looking at reviews and someone mention HairOne, I bought a small sample packet at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply and have been using  it, ever since nearly 3 years.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft right after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Hair one makes my hair shiny and easy to style, but I can&#x27;t go as long between washings as I can with Wen.  </li>
            <li>I did not find that it was quite as good as my other brand, so I&#x27;ve gone back to it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the other reviews here, it seems that this product works for many people, just not for me:</li>
            <li>After the first use of Hair One, I was completely sold!  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is I feel that my hair is more wild then normal</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more of a Wen experience (based on other reviews)</li>
            <li>Next step will be to clean up the pump and disassemble to try and use.</li>
            <li>I purchased Hair One for myself and am pleased with it, yet what really pleases me is that I decided to use it on my baby, since it is less drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt CLEAN and my scalp a little cool even.</li>
            <li>At second use and after, I wasn&#x27;t as strict about following directions in that I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to how many pumps I was using.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky, voluminous and very manageable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better when you work from the ends up as opposed as roots down.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair cut into a cute a-line bob.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for my daughter with super long thick hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li>commented the last time I received a trim regarding how healthy my hair has become since my last visit.</li>
            <li>Decent price too.</li>
            <li>The only thing i didnt like about it was that my hair got oily quickly after.</li>
            <li>Also, I recently cut my hair really short again (pixie cut), and this shampoo seems to work better with my hair now.  </li>
            <li>I think that the Wen is better, but so much more expensive.</li>
            <li>My only recourse when it would get super itchy had been some Benadryl and Scalpicin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today, after my third use I am completely flake and buildup free.</li>
            <li>I have very corse hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair got kind of greasy and heavy right after blow drying, which was definitly something new for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched it up to using this twice a week and on my third wash using my Nature&#x27;s Gate tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>As a result of having no pump I am using more product than I need and making a mess in my shower every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biggest Pro:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy with the product so far, especially considering that it has left my hair amazingly smooth and its noticeably less frizzy following blow-drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>; database (which I highly recommend, btw) and</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>: high.</li>
            <li>I learned to read a little better about the products I purchase.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and idea of this shampoo/conditioner, it definitely helps calm an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>But I find that my hair stays silky looking and soft for much longer than after &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very greasy as opposed to soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I use a sulfate free shampoo from Costco which costs the same and you get 3 times as much and get the same results.</li>
            <li>then it would normally be.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who washes your hair everyday, you might like it more.</li>
            <li>and I also take Biotin, phyto hair and nail pills and biosil plus a good multivitamin because I also feel that my hair loss was due to not eating for a while due to stress and depression.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the almond one for when my scalp is normal, so I might switch to that and see.</li>
            <li>Love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out afterward.  </li>
            <li>I want to mention though that usually when it comes to these products much of the end result has to do with your hair type so for some it might be better than others.</li>
            <li>: I wet my hair let it satuate with just water for 2-3 minutes, then I started to apply the Hair One, at first it just didn&#x27;t feel right because I&#x27;m used to a lather.  </li>
            <li>In the past I was hesitant to even spend $15 on a hair product, but since I had such great results with the other cleansing conditioner I decided it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I FINALLY found a product that manages the dry and flakiness in my hair.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t make my hair particularly shiny, soft, manageable, or anything else fantastic, BUT it did clear up my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I only need to wash once a week now, which is a HUGE improvement as the whole hair washing thing is a long ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest to give it a try if you looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>It lathers slightly and doesn&#x27;t comb through as easily, though.</li>
            <li>Though my curls looked nice when air- dried, my hair did not look moisturized as the top hair was slightly frizzy and dry looking.  </li>
            <li>I had my wife look too, as I was skeptical after so many attempts and years of dealing with this affliction, and she saw the same as I did, a normal, healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>My ends are very soft.</li>
            <li>(I am a black woman, with full shoulder length, permed hair with a semipermanant rinse) who wants to make and keep my hair healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In just the past month of me using this product, my hair stop shedding, coming out in my comb, and, not to mention, is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Being able to apply a small amount as a leave-in conditioner was an added benefit.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased Hair One from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply based on there reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a try as my fingers were starting to cramp up and show signs of carpal tunnel from all the scalp massages.</li>
            <li>and I only need to use 3 pumps total, then I just run a pick through to disperse it better like I traditionally do with any conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to get about 5 washes from these small bottles.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair once, maybe twice a week [in hot weather], then use a regular conditioner and add the Hair One after rinsing.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact my hair is breaking much more than usual and I&#x27;m having to cut pieces out.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft!</li>
            <li>Not as good as wen,but less than half the price</li>
            <li>It does tend to make my hair flat on the top, so what I&#x27;ve been doing is using Hair one, but every few days I add some regular shampoo at the end of my shower and do a quick lather.</li>
            <li>After first washing hair was soft, shiny and manageable even though I didn&#x27;t do my usual roller set followed by light hot brush a/o flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I use a round brush or flat iron to style my hair most days, and it still styles really well with this product.</li>
            <li>I usually put Hairone into  my hair early in the morning, then I end up washing it out after about 3-5 hours (depends on the day) for me the longer it stays in my hair the better</li>
            <li>I would be fine with this two-step process if this shampoo wasn&#x27;t a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>Always love this stuff - works as well as Wen but much less expensive and smells better!</li>
            <li>Using the normal sulfate free shampoos, I have to wash my hair every other day and at the end of that 2nd day, my hair looks pretty gross.  </li>
            <li>After I had it all in there and finally combed it through, I felt the sensation of the tingles and the metomophsis of my hair going from dry and lifeless to hydrant and smooth to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked this review from the original 5 stars down to 3 stars.</li>
            <li>When I found about this product, I ordered it right away because I also have problems with dry and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>For the past month I&#x27;ve had extremely soft hair that blow dries and straightens nicely with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done all kinds of scalp treatments on him but nothing has ever helped clear up his condition.</li>
            <li>I thought it would clear up on</li>
            <li>but I must say I&#x27;m presently surprised.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower, I was surprised at how soft and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so soft and shiny and</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go through the complete routine on her.  </li>
            <li>Her cradle cap is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I really wish it came in bigger bottles.  </li>
            <li>and I like how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair and could not believe how soft and manageable it was after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural product that he likes.</li>
            <li>I had medium length hair, not real thick.</li>
            <li>My hair is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Until growing it out, I had no prior knowledge of how to straighten, relax, or even really take care of my hair.</li>
            <li>When I use regular shampoo with my current haircut I don&#x27;t get nearly the same texturized look as when I use sulfate free shampoos like Wen or Hair One.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, manageable, shinny.  </li>
            <li>but I was willing to put up with it so long as I didn&#x27;t have to suffer through the unbearable itching.</li>
            <li>Very drying and, again, not the same as WEN.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled.</li>
            <li>It also requried way too much product to make financial sense.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as Wen did.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might help, but it seemed that it stripped my hair of the natural oils.  </li>
            <li>By the time I wash my hair, there&#x27;s a good amount of oils on it, and where this product is about not stripping your hair, by the time I was out of the shower my hair was still really o​ily and dirty looking.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping to find a good substitute for the expensive WEN cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have to add water to the bottle once it gets down to 1/4 full</li>
            <li>I tried the dry scalp formula first, since my scalp gets flakey and itchy.  </li>
            <li>super runny formula that left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>10 pumps or more is just crazy after just that week of using it, it was pretty much all gone.</li>
            <li>I noticed a big change with the first use, and my scalp was completely cured in only 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Pretty much every product he tries gives him dandruff so he kept going back to head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>but like many of you I think 30 bucks for a bottle of the stuff is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I have found that if you use this first and rinse well, then shampoo with your normal shampoo, you still help the dry skin but wont leave your roots oily later in the day.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 28 year-old Indigenous Mexican male and this is my first time growing my hair to shoulder length, also, I&#x27;ve never dyed it or straighten it.)</li>
            <li>The next day, the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s a slight wave in the back), fine hair but lots of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a natural shampoo that would make my hair calm down.</li>
            <li>My hair still looked dry, again not a huge improvement, but better.    </li>
            <li>The Wen commercials are very convincing, but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li>Sort of like, rather than washing my hair, I just kept getting dirty hair wet and adding more and more conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to go back to normal shampoos since I started using Hairone</li>
            <li>So instead I tried it with my normal shampoo on the scalp and used this as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the Wen but a few extra pumps and you have enought to cover your hair, works just fine for the price.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair, SLS allergy, and a very sensitive/itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly , dry Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>This really helped with the dry skin.</li>
            <li>I paid about a third of the cost of Wen, but I used 3 times as much product and still didn&#x27;t achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li>It took about two months for me to notice major changes, but I AM AMAZED,</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a little longer than using traditional shampoo and conditioner, but it is SOOO worth it!</li>
            <li>However, no other product treated all my symptoms and this one has.</li>
            <li>It has been exactly one month since using Hair One tea tree formula and there is a noticeable improvement in my dry scalp and overall volume.</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to apply, and it also takes a lot of product, but it has been so worth it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely softer and much less frizzy than ever before, and this product worked better for frizz than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I stopped using all other products other than a light hair spray.</li>
            <li>I have long double-processed blonde hair, and this product is very nourishing.  </li>
            <li>There were only 2 that listed higher and both were still in the low to moderate concern range, and both were among the last ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can barely get it out of the bottle even when you take out the pump and try to squeeze it out.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde, medium long hair that, after Hair One, was bunched up in tangled nests all over my head - even after following the directions on the bottle exactly.</li>
            <li>sometimes I would wet my hair and apply the product, then brush my teeth, use the toilet, and THEN take a long shower, hoping the extra time would net me better results, and while it did improve them, planing for extra time soon became a major annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry scalp normally and have tried many brands over the years and usually had to resort to a dandruff shampoo just to help the itchiness, however that often left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry and get the \\&quot;poof\\&quot; like I normally do with lathering shampoos.</li>
            <li>Even after the first couple uses, I could feel some added volume and an ever so slight increase in vivacity to my hair.</li>
            <li>I actually used this product in combination with the Jojoba formula and mixed in a little of Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen but the pricetag kept me from trying it, I dont really know why though as I&#x27;ve plopped down obscene amounts of money on special conditioners in the past.  </li>
            <li>I can say that my hair was clean and it did not feel hard and crunchy.  </li>
            <li>My main problem is that my hair gets really dry, looks damaged with split ends, even if I recently got a haircut.</li>
            <li>I have to shampoo daily with medicated shampoos because of my scalp condition, and I have to say that the hair one tea tree formula controlled my scalp AND left my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I do have eczema, and this formula did not take away all of the dry scalp that I had, so I do add pure tea tree oil directly on to my scalp once to twice a week, and dry, itchy scalp is gone!!!</li>
            <li>Although this product does deliver on the conditioning as promised, it is pretty greasy and requires that I wash my hair daily - which I wasn&#x27;t doing previously.</li>
            <li>Do wish the tea tree oil was stronger as I long that invigerating feel, but so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li>so i decided to dye my hair back to my natural color (dark brown) and began using HairOne for curly hair and it has completely rejuvenated my hair!</li>
            <li>I got this product about a week ago, I have natural 4a-4b type hair, I chose to get the Tea Tree formula because its for dry scalp, anywhoo after rinsing the product out</li>
            <li>You have to get used to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like typical shampoos (just remember that chemicals are responsible for foam and bubbles).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had success with products in the past only for my symptoms to return.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, my husband&#x27;s hair is SUPER thick and dense.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking bouncy, not flat!</li>
            <li>Like the others have said, it&#x27;s a little on the costly side, but if you have dealt with dry scalp like I have, it&#x27;s worth every penny, plus some.</li>
            <li>For myself, I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on Wen right now because my hair needs it, but if I ever decide it&#x27;s too expensive, I&#x27;ll be going back to regular shampoo, not</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I NEVER saw her hair look so beautiful!</li>
            <li> This was great!</li>
            <li> But again, it wasn&#x27;t miraculously perfect hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, my hair feels revitalize</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it&#x27;s best to try it out and find what amount and technique works best for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, but does require a lot of washing!</li>

            <li> This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I will NEVER use another hair product again (except WEN)!!</li>
            <li> but in my opinion there is a reason Wen is twice as much, a very good one at that.</li>
            <li> Great price - great product!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so much impressed with this Sally&#x27;s product, I got a discount card (lol, I never buy membership cards).  </li>
            <li> The tea tree oil is awesome because it cools and tingles your scalp, feels so good.</li>
            <li> so I used the Tea Tree formulation - great tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> But I think this would be great for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> She is also happy with her results.</li>
            <li> This does a great job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> , it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be broke, but my hair will look great.</li>
            <li> but this helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for not just a weightless conditioner but for your scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report, after 2 washings, that it has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; cleared up my eczema (cradle cap lol) and keeps my hair moisturized here in the desert climate.  </li>
            <li> and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> It would have been great if this product had worked.</li>
            <li> Product is great.</li>
            <li> I no longer have frizzy fly aways, my hair is manageable, my hair is silky and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am here to buy more Hair One, and I hope this product is never discontinued!!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> BUT this review would&#x27;ve been 3 stars if I hadn&#x27;t discovered it&#x27;s magical leave-in properties!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Make sure you comb it through as suggested after working into the scalp for the best results.  </li>
            <li> look forward to seeing what kind of results continued use brings!</li>
            <li> It was just OK, I am still looking for my perfect substitute for WEN products.</li>
            <li> which is remarkable since I have scalp psoriasis</li>
            <li> One my hair felt silky smooth and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> which may be sooner than I would think since I seem to need a good amount of it.</li>
            <li> and I put some spray in to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in a pinch, but that&#x27;s it for me.</li>
            <li> Good substitute for Wen.</li>
            <li> Also tried the jojoba oil &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for color treated hair and it is good too</li>
            <li> Some people think it is a good replacement</li>
            <li> My scalp did feel good and  refreshed</li>
            <li> Maybe this would be good for bouncy curls, but not for kinky curls.</li>
            <li> Good price and value too.</li>
            <li> even after it was rinsed out it burned for a good 10-15 minutes after that.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product but did not meet my needs&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> Also this doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> This type of  product doesn&#x27;t cause scalp irritation on me and works as good as Wen for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I  wish I could have said I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I think it wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It has more body and great managability.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for well over a year now and have been very very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels!   </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it more and with each use my hair became more and more flawless.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> and my hands are feeling better too!</li>
            <li> Love it !  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> An amazing product.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp feel amazing and got rid of dandruff</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I combine it with</li>
            <li> Great product overall and exceptionally great price!</li>
            <li> WEN is a lot creamier, silkier, and you can FEEL it conditioning your hair and your fingers can glide through your hair so nicely.  </li>
            <li> liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Product smells nice and</li>
            <li> The bottle was not packed in it&#x27;s own box, but just a plastic bag</li>
            <li> This product makes your scalp feel nice and tingly, but I do not like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy/red scalp for close to over a year, it would come and go and to be honest</li>
            <li> Nice conditioning and helps get the stiffness out of my hair.</li>
            <li> smells nice and cleans my hair, but it leaves my hair rather tangled, so i need to use another conditioning product after this, which kind of defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, not too medicinal.  </li>
            <li> I had tried Wen before, and liked the results but did not want to spend $40 on one bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was thrilled when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> (side note, I use Living Proof Full and have had really great results).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty incredible</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong, it leaves my hair feeling like straw</li>
            <li> It also smells very strongly of Tea Tree oil, and is medicine-y.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed after using Hair One Tea Tree Cleanser and Conditioner how soft and manageable</li>
            <li> And I follow the directions on the bottle, with my own discretion to my hair length and texture.  : )</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean on hair (kind of like Head N Shoulders used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was great.</li>
            <li> And it turned out with some pretty great results for me.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, so if your budget needs tightening, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Used it on my below shoulder length very fine fair hair and got amazing results on the first wash.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the pump as I think a squeeze bottle would be better suited.  </li>
            <li> I love using this Cleanser conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a must have item for me. :)</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt softer, better conditioned, shinier.  </li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t get over how healthy</li>
            <li> I have soooo many shampoos and conditioners in my closet.</li>
            <li> It was just better than before.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair One for about two weeks now and am quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is growing longer, and it&#x27;s healthy, thicker, shiny, and almost frizz free!   </li>
            <li> my hair is softer and feels better after washing.  </li>
            <li> To help remedy most of it</li>
            <li> 4 different races dose  not make for great hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell of the tea tree isn&#x27;t great, but the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay with my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this</li>
            <li> After one use my hair is shiny, smooth and the fly-aways are gone!  </li>
            <li> I thought it smells better then the Wen tea tree, but then again, anything with tea tree oil is going to have that funky smell.</li>
            <li> Compared to Wen Hair One is just OK.</li>
            <li> To achieve closer effects to those achieved with Wen, I had to use a lot more &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34; and leave it in my hair for longer--</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> My scalp still had some itching, but it&#x27;s getting better every week.  </li>
            <li> I love Hair One.</li>
            <li> I love it.it</li>
            <li> My hair seems fuller, shinier, and has more body.  </li>
            <li> and I am really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The color looks better too.  </li>
            <li> The recommendations feel more like a scam for sales to me...</li>
            <li> and we love this line (they use the olive oil variety).  </li>
            <li> It truly is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Ok product.  </li>
            <li> My hair was never terrible</li>
            <li> I love no suds  shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I love the product.</li>
            <li> and I love it, but thought I would try hair.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> After one weeks use I have noticed my hair is softer and has a lot more shine compared to using Wen.</li>
            <li> most ingredients were 1&#x27;s or 0&#x27;s in their safety listing system.</li>
            <li> The results are much better than before.</li>
            <li> this helps :)</li>
            <li> I do like the volume and ease of being able to comb through</li>
            <li> It has never been softer or more healthier.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> She has been using this for about two weeks and asked me to order more, because it works so well.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so safe to use.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many ways to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li> I tried it again, a couple more times, assuming, perhaps</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars because, though it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s not necessarily terrible.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I suggest this as more of a conditioner than an all over cleanser.</li>
            <li> Hair one is an okay substitute.  </li>
            <li> my curls, lovely.  </li>
            <li> One curly formula with argan oil will perform better in my hair.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m okay with that, as it did perform as well for me.  </li>
            <li> cause I love tea tree stuff</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Try it! :))</li>
            <li> also want to mention since I see so many people pointing out that this is like Wen but 1/3</li>
            <li> so when you account for the 33% more you get with Wen</li>
            <li> love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to transition yourself from shampoo to this no-poo.  </li>
            <li> It some how feels more healthy.</li>
            <li> and im just now getting better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to add water to emulsify it when using.</li>
            <li> No changes in my hair....except more oily...</li>
            <li> I sure wish WEN could be a bit more competitive with the price.</li>
            <li> After I read through many reviews I decided to give it a try and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen since the beginning of the year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a very nice addition to my regimen to getting my gorgeous hair back.</li>
            <li> some reason, I though it would be a good idea to mix the two together right into the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine, hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good, plus safe to use.  </li>
            <li> It made my scalp tingly and my hair feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Hair always feels very clean.    </li>
            <li> I spend a good 3 minutes rinsing the product out of my hair and make sure I lift the upper layers out of the way so that the under layers get a good rinsing too.  </li>
            <li> I love how easy my hair is to comb after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I knew that tea tree oil had been the most successful out of all of the other attempts, and I saw its good reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted something to make it look healthy and smooth.    </li>
            <li> Like Wen, this is a great shampoo for sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li> Loved the way my hair would easily comb through and how much healthier it looked</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair - after washing with this cleansing conditioner, my hair was soft and had great volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t end up going with the forty-dollar bottle of Wen, which was originally recommended to</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and does not build up.</li>
            <li> not too strong-</li>
            <li> I like the benefits of tea tree oil, but a lot of the products that have it, tend to smell too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably not bad and may be better than what your using now</li>
            <li> , I noticed a difference in my hair..which is baby fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and will use it once a week.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair stuff i have ever tried it doesnt damage my hair at all like most hair products have in the past</li>
            <li> HairOne smells very good and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; makes your hair feel like pure silk, i barely need to run the comb through my hair because it detangles it so well after cleansing with HairOne and can also be used as a leave in conditioner, which in my case is perfect considering my hair is  very dry!</li>
            <li> This gives me the best combination of healthy-looking, less damaged hair that is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> the price, that isn&#x27;t actually accurate.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something to smooth frizz and help repair damage, I think this is a product you should try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I did the keratin treatment on my hair and needed a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li> Now that I see how nice this has made my hair and after reading reviews I really want to try Wen now.  </li>
            <li> and I have to use additional products to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d possibly help someone else find a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for 7 months, and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 days and my scalp/forehead/face was completely free of redness.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has really been effective.</li>
            <li> tea tree oil scent is too light...</li>
            <li> I came across a sulfate free and paraben free tea tree oil shampoo by Nature&#x27;s Gate that I thought was my savoir.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a pleasant odor, you can feel it working on the scalp (not meaning to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s true), and the overall feeling of my hair and scalp was incredible afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a Sally&#x27;s beauty store for around $11.00 because I ran out of Wen and couldn&#x27;t afford to get more right away.</li>
            <li> Wen, even though it was lather free, it actually left my hair feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that works!!</li>
            <li> It was very much like Wen in my opinion, though it didn&#x27;t smell quite as good and my scalp didn&#x27;t tingle quite as much</li>
            <li> That first day I went onto Amazon to order more and it was no longer available</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first, when I was trying this cleanser out, I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will every get Wen (my original intent), but for now, Hair One works for me.</li>
            <li> My hair shows a difference with it, and I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Much better than the higher priced competitor</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> Also, it is too soon to tell for sure, but my first impression is that it is making my hair oilier.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, my hair is healthy and you can&#x27;t even tell the years of damage I put it through.  </li>
            <li> Great for my hair which is completely grey.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to discover a non-shampoo cleansing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as thick and creamy as Wen, and doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice.  </li>
            <li> I loved it the first time I used it, although the smell is way too strong (like old woman perfume).  </li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean and tingly.  </li>
            <li> Several reviews mentioned Hair One, a cheaper but comparable product, so I went with the most cost effective.</li>
            <li> The tea tree is great for my dry scalp</li>
            <li> one week after I made the switch, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> , it seemed to give me a lot of build up on my scalp and my head just did not feel clean.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a clean freak).  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to my three dollar bottle of sulfate-free Trader Joe&#x27;s shampoo and it has been more effective for me.</li>
            <li> It even holds up to 10-mile-run hair and gets me squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Yet my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nine months, and my hair has completely changed for the better!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking too!</li>
            <li> it works really well, and if used right makes the hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair detangled, incredibly smooth, and smelling great (no sulfur smell like some of the other products have).</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t see what so special about it.  </li>
            <li> makes your scalp feel cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> It sooths my scalp and actually dose a good job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> Wen is much richer and thicker and it smells a lot better than Hair One.</li>
            <li> I switched back to using it every day, and it&#x27;s looking good again.  </li>
            <li> In many ways it has been very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try WEN, but saw this product as a more reasonably priced alternative.</li>
            <li> His hair has been very sleek, shiny, and healthy and he has had no dandruff.</li>
            <li> I liked it better than my regular shampoo and conditioner combinations at first, but I also felt the need to use some leave-in product and spray-on oil afterwards because my hair was just never as smooth as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I did like they said and made sure to rinse really well afterwards, but it still built up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting blonde highlights in my hair for a good 7 years now.  </li>
            <li> Hair stylist said my hair was healthy and it&#x27;s much cheaper than Wen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nowhere near the level of wen, but it&#x27;s an ok replacement if you run out of wen and can&#x27;t get more right away.</li>
            <li> The 1st use I thought it was ok but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the price, but the 2nd use made a huge impact on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensative scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried Wen you could fall in love with Hair One because it is still a million times better than traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> Luckily it was still easier to comb through</li>
            <li> I love this and will definitely buy more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> so I quickly rinsed it out,</li>
            <li> Please post if you find something comparable to WEN at a more realistic price.</li>
            <li> This particular smell is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li> my natural red highlights really stand out now and my hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Using Hair One, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair still looked pretty good by the end of the 2nd day, so I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every 3 days instead.  </li>
            <li> As always, Hair One products make my hair shiny, soft, &amp; twice as beautiful as any regular store bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Literally after the first wash he expressed his scalp felt ten times better with a minty refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> I recently picked up two more bottles of Hair One at Bealls Outlet for $7.99!</li>
            <li> However, that being said, Hair One is a lot better than most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or any of that other junk.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot compare to that, but my hair felt clean and soft and smelled clean!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve started using my Organix sulfate-free shampoo first to clean my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> and I hope you try HairOne and enjoy it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Juanita</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give my hair quite as much volume and doesn&#x27;t leave it as smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have since changed to another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and am much happier.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I didn&#x27;t pay as much, should have been a give away.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone and then decided if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the cost of Wen, its well worth the price and time.</li>
            <li> Maybe ok to use once a week just to clear up your scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a beauty supply store along with a scalp massager and natural bristle hair brush (both are recommended for healthy scalp).</li>
            <li> I even tried using different, more pricey sulfate free shampoos (pureology and redkin).</li>
            <li> It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have been using sulfate free for years, now after rinsing I follow up with Jonathan Antin moisturizing shampoo (sulfate free) and it completely removed the Hair One build up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smooth and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for more natural products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll try my own homemade recipes next time.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but I have very long hair</li>
            <li> of the other reviews also experienced this problem and I can assure you that it has nothing to do with how much you rinse.</li>
            <li> The 2 of us go through one bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> first, the super strength dandruff shampoo helped at bit, but I would still flare up.</li>
            <li> I will re-order WEN instead of buying ONE right now</li>
            <li> I could see a noticeable difference right away.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair and scalp gently, but you need to use it every day to maintain a clean hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair very well and rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and full of body, and my scalp itch free</li>
            <li> easy to use, leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft, clean, and fragrant!  </li>
            <li> I got positive comments on my hair from people I see every day the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> I guess it really is true that it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair of its much needed oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this product will work great for every type of hair.</li>
            <li> I am so happy it tried it, no more embarrassing flakes</li>
            <li> I thought it was just something I&#x27;d have to live with until I heard someone talk about using a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Subsequent washings and using my set routine resulted in all of the above along with great body.</li>
            <li> I need to use so much of it to untangle my hair that it defeats the purpose of its cheaper price because it gets used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have since gone on to try Wen, and I very much prefer it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This formula works as well as all the other formulas and has a really great cooling action on my scalp.</li>
            <li> thick, black coarse hair and Wen gives my hair an incredible amount of moisture, volume and best of all makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in Wen until reading reviews here and saw that this exists.</li>
            <li> I think I will try the WEN to see if it is literally possible for my hair to look even better than it alreay does.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product if you can&#x27;t afford the WEN!!</li>
            <li> I was interested in purchasing Wen but decided to read some of the reviews before doing so.</li>
            <li> After the first wash with Hair</li>
            <li> At first use, I followed directions on bottle to a T.</li>
            <li> While rinsing product out in the shower I noticed that my hair felt really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I also get a relaxer on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> This worked well on all counts ;)</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Wen after I ran out of the first one my friend gave me.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The tea tree scent is light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> I followed the bottle directions and from the first time using it</li>
            <li> I used to use a spray in leave in detagler/conditioner, which I did not need from the first time using Hair One.</li>
            <li> I use Wen regularly and was looking to purchase more, when I came upon the Hair One products.  </li>
            <li> this is my first product review ever.</li>
            <li> Love this product and ordering on-line saves an extra stop at beauty supply store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like my 5 year olds hair again and it feels so natural and light.</li>
            <li> you will fall in love with what it does for you hair and won&#x27;t ever want to go back!</li>
            <li> There are better options for cleansing conditioner in the same price range.</li>
            <li> He used to always use Head and Shoulders and since we&#x27;ve been married (2 years)</li>
            <li> However, I think from now on I&#x27;ll return to the ol&#x27; first shampoo and then condition with two seperate products.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Campho-Phenique, like a medicine smell.  </li>
            <li> When I looked up the product online, however, I decided to instead order Hair One, which I was led to believe would be pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than WEN!</li>
            <li> Yes wen is more pricey but you can buy 16oz or32oz which last about 2 months...</li>
            <li> Overall I do like the product although I would love to try WEN someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to wear it very, very short in order to be able to wash and go.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair felt oily, which is practically the first time in my life my hair has EVER felt oily.</li>
            <li> but when I used this the first time it burned my scalp for a while.  </li>
            <li> I have worn my hair short for most of my 40+ years because I can&#x27;t stand combing it out.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> After the second use, it was even better.</li>
            <li> If I have any symptoms return, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is probably better than your standard shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know which came first.</li>
            <li> First discovered this at Sallys then found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has a different, lighter consistency and is more transparent than WEN.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a cleansing wash</li>
            <li> Ingredients listed first are more abundant, and the Hair One ingredient list includes the natural extracts much farther down the list than Wen does.</li>
            <li> I just put on as much as I thought felt right.</li>
            <li> But adding a couple pumps of this on the bottom half of my hair makes my hair look and feel soft, smooth, and healthy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often because I know that it&#x27;s natural oils are good for it, but that also might have been why I didn&#x27;t use this product very long.</li>
            <li> Also, because I style my hair curly (as much curl as you get with a pixie cut), it&#x27;s important for my hair not to be stripped of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Wen left my hair light, soft, and so tangle-free that I can easily run a comb through after the shower (unlike Hair One).</li>
            <li> Hair One is a good alternative and the price is about the same as similar salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use much less of the tea tree oil WEN, and my hair and scalp feel sooo much better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this product would make my hair and scalp greasy, but as long as I take the time to make sure it is all rinsed out, I do not have any problems.  </li>
            <li> After the second use and what really prompted me to write this review is that I had much smoother hair, it styled with ease and looked very hydrated and healthy for the first time in about two years.  </li>
            <li> It took awhile to get here because of a large amazon package I ordered but it was still pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and might try a different formula just to make sure.</li>
            <li> But if you have super curly, kinky, or thick hair with a tendency to frizziness, you&#x27;ll probably love it as I do!</li>
            <li> It definitely is not as conditioning as WEN, but it is a very good alternative if you can&#x27;t afford WEN since it has decent ingredients without the harsh sulfates.    </li>
            <li> The best method I&#x27;ve found for styling my hair is to let it air dry for a while, then blow dry on low heat.</li>
            <li> I love that the dry scalp formula (haven&#x27;t tried others yet)</li>
            <li> after last night&#x27;s usage of this product, I was amazed when looking in the mirror when I saw what appeared to be a normal, healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, however after using for a couple of weeks my hair began to feel coated and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It has Tea Tree Oil and does not leave my hair oily, but as light and full of volume as the other formulas.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years (including straight olive oil, which is super messy and time consuming), and none have had an impact on the flaking like this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair type is medium to fine, wavy, and I stripped it about three years ago, and had major hair and scalp issues after that, and I had to cut my hair super short.</li>
            <li> I would compare the light feeling to having 3 inches cut off your hair, there is so much stuff built up on your hair from regular shampoos and this just gets rid of it all without stripping out the moisture.</li>
            <li> I was loosing too much hair, and when I switched to Hair One, my hair lose</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read directions until I was in the shower ready to use it, so</li>
            <li> I was really nervous that this product would make my hair feel and look greasy, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much.</li>
            <li> But my hair was much more tangeled when wet and felt drier after using a blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very specifically, it seemed like a lot of work for shampoo;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather but you can feel the formula as it&#x27;s absorbing into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, price and the quality..</li>
            <li> But when you massage it the hair for 2-3 minutes you really begin to feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I am really amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much healthier and it almost looks like I&#x27;ve just had a haircut.  </li>
            <li> Have used this twice, works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t help too much with the dryness.</li>
            <li> I prefer the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Hair One</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Plus you have to use so much</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t damage my scalp as fast, but eventually, I was itching again.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> but i really wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was experiencing a very itchy scalp (no dandruff, just dryness).</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very soothing on my scalp and has a hot/cold/minty feeling while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I tried over 6 products but nothing seems to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find a real difference between the two, except that Wen is thicker.</li>
            <li> I will tell you this: I bought Wen recently because it was $20 with all these extras and free shipping as a promo, and the Hair One performs just as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how my hair came out when used it on my whole head scalp</li>
            <li> I did not find an ingredient list before I made my purchase, simply that it was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> However, it did not moisturize as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> I tried fragrance free shampoos, cider vinegar treatments, coconut oil, simply not using any shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> My complaints with Hair One is that it doesn&#x27;t really help my flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> Hydrates the scalp without too much oily residue</li>
            <li> As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and its pretty curly so finding a good, shampoo &amp; conditioner to keep my hair moisturized has always been a struggle, when looking into Wen i was looking at reviews and someone mention HairOne, I bought a small sample packet at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply and have been using  it, ever since nearly 3 years.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft right after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Hair one makes my hair shiny and easy to style, but I can&#x27;t go as long between washings as I can with Wen.  </li>
            <li> I did not find that it was quite as good as my other brand, so I&#x27;ve gone back to it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the other reviews here, it seems that this product works for many people, just not for me:</li>
            <li> After the first use of Hair One, I was completely sold!  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is I feel that my hair is more wild then normal</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more of a Wen experience (based on other reviews)</li>
            <li> Next step will be to clean up the pump and disassemble to try and use.</li>
            <li> I purchased Hair One for myself and am pleased with it, yet what really pleases me is that I decided to use it on my baby, since it is less drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt CLEAN and my scalp a little cool even.</li>
            <li> At second use and after, I wasn&#x27;t as strict about following directions in that I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to how many pumps I was using.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky, voluminous and very manageable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better when you work from the ends up as opposed as roots down.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair cut into a cute a-line bob.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for my daughter with super long thick hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li> commented the last time I received a trim regarding how healthy my hair has become since my last visit.</li>
            <li> Decent price too.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didnt like about it was that my hair got oily quickly after.</li>
            <li> Also, I recently cut my hair really short again (pixie cut), and this shampoo seems to work better with my hair now.  </li>
            <li> I think that the Wen is better, but so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> My only recourse when it would get super itchy had been some Benadryl and Scalpicin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, after my third use I am completely flake and buildup free.</li>
            <li> I have very corse hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair got kind of greasy and heavy right after blow drying, which was definitly something new for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched it up to using this twice a week and on my third wash using my Nature&#x27;s Gate tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> As a result of having no pump I am using more product than I need and making a mess in my shower every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biggest Pro:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely happy with the product so far, especially considering that it has left my hair amazingly smooth and its noticeably less frizzy following blow-drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ; database (which I highly recommend, btw) and</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> : high.</li>
            <li> I learned to read a little better about the products I purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and idea of this shampoo/conditioner, it definitely helps calm an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> But I find that my hair stays silky looking and soft for much longer than after &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very greasy as opposed to soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use a sulfate free shampoo from Costco which costs the same and you get 3 times as much and get the same results.</li>
            <li> then it would normally be.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who washes your hair everyday, you might like it more.</li>
            <li> and I also take Biotin, phyto hair and nail pills and biosil plus a good multivitamin because I also feel that my hair loss was due to not eating for a while due to stress and depression.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the almond one for when my scalp is normal, so I might switch to that and see.</li>
            <li> Love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out afterward.  </li>
            <li> I want to mention though that usually when it comes to these products much of the end result has to do with your hair type so for some it might be better than others.</li>
            <li> : I wet my hair let it satuate with just water for 2-3 minutes, then I started to apply the Hair One, at first it just didn&#x27;t feel right because I&#x27;m used to a lather.  </li>
            <li> In the past I was hesitant to even spend $15 on a hair product, but since I had such great results with the other cleansing conditioner I decided it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I FINALLY found a product that manages the dry and flakiness in my hair.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make my hair particularly shiny, soft, manageable, or anything else fantastic, BUT it did clear up my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I only need to wash once a week now, which is a HUGE improvement as the whole hair washing thing is a long ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest to give it a try if you looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> It lathers slightly and doesn&#x27;t comb through as easily, though.</li>
            <li> Though my curls looked nice when air- dried, my hair did not look moisturized as the top hair was slightly frizzy and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> I had my wife look too, as I was skeptical after so many attempts and years of dealing with this affliction, and she saw the same as I did, a normal, healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> My ends are very soft.</li>
            <li> (I am a black woman, with full shoulder length, permed hair with a semipermanant rinse) who wants to make and keep my hair healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just the past month of me using this product, my hair stop shedding, coming out in my comb, and, not to mention, is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Being able to apply a small amount as a leave-in conditioner was an added benefit.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased Hair One from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply based on there reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a try as my fingers were starting to cramp up and show signs of carpal tunnel from all the scalp massages.</li>
            <li> and I only need to use 3 pumps total, then I just run a pick through to disperse it better like I traditionally do with any conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to get about 5 washes from these small bottles.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once, maybe twice a week [in hot weather], then use a regular conditioner and add the Hair One after rinsing.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact my hair is breaking much more than usual and I&#x27;m having to cut pieces out.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft!</li>
            <li> Not as good as wen,but less than half the price</li>
            <li> It does tend to make my hair flat on the top, so what I&#x27;ve been doing is using Hair one, but every few days I add some regular shampoo at the end of my shower and do a quick lather.</li>
            <li> After first washing hair was soft, shiny and manageable even though I didn&#x27;t do my usual roller set followed by light hot brush a/o flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use a round brush or flat iron to style my hair most days, and it still styles really well with this product.</li>
            <li> I usually put Hairone into  my hair early in the morning, then I end up washing it out after about 3-5 hours (depends on the day) for me the longer it stays in my hair the better</li>
            <li> I would be fine with this two-step process if this shampoo wasn&#x27;t a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Always love this stuff - works as well as Wen but much less expensive and smells better!</li>
            <li> Using the normal sulfate free shampoos, I have to wash my hair every other day and at the end of that 2nd day, my hair looks pretty gross.  </li>
            <li> After I had it all in there and finally combed it through, I felt the sensation of the tingles and the metomophsis of my hair going from dry and lifeless to hydrant and smooth to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked this review from the original 5 stars down to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> When I found about this product, I ordered it right away because I also have problems with dry and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> For the past month I&#x27;ve had extremely soft hair that blow dries and straightens nicely with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done all kinds of scalp treatments on him but nothing has ever helped clear up his condition.</li>
            <li> I thought it would clear up on</li>
            <li> but I must say I&#x27;m presently surprised.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower, I was surprised at how soft and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so soft and shiny and</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go through the complete routine on her.  </li>
            <li> Her cradle cap is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I really wish it came in bigger bottles.  </li>
            <li> and I like how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair and could not believe how soft and manageable it was after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural product that he likes.</li>
            <li> I had medium length hair, not real thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Until growing it out, I had no prior knowledge of how to straighten, relax, or even really take care of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I use regular shampoo with my current haircut I don&#x27;t get nearly the same texturized look as when I use sulfate free shampoos like Wen or Hair One.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, manageable, shinny.  </li>
            <li> but I was willing to put up with it so long as I didn&#x27;t have to suffer through the unbearable itching.</li>
            <li> Very drying and, again, not the same as WEN.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled.</li>
            <li> It also requried way too much product to make financial sense.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as Wen did.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might help, but it seemed that it stripped my hair of the natural oils.  </li>
            <li> By the time I wash my hair, there&#x27;s a good amount of oils on it, and where this product is about not stripping your hair, by the time I was out of the shower my hair was still really o​ily and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping to find a good substitute for the expensive WEN cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have to add water to the bottle once it gets down to 1/4 full</li>
            <li> I tried the dry scalp formula first, since my scalp gets flakey and itchy.  </li>
            <li> super runny formula that left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> 10 pumps or more is just crazy after just that week of using it, it was pretty much all gone.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big change with the first use, and my scalp was completely cured in only 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Pretty much every product he tries gives him dandruff so he kept going back to head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> but like many of you I think 30 bucks for a bottle of the stuff is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have found that if you use this first and rinse well, then shampoo with your normal shampoo, you still help the dry skin but wont leave your roots oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a 28 year-old Indigenous Mexican male and this is my first time growing my hair to shoulder length, also, I&#x27;ve never dyed it or straighten it.)</li>
            <li> The next day, the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a slight wave in the back), fine hair but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a natural shampoo that would make my hair calm down.</li>
            <li> My hair still looked dry, again not a huge improvement, but better.    </li>
            <li> The Wen commercials are very convincing, but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> Sort of like, rather than washing my hair, I just kept getting dirty hair wet and adding more and more conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to go back to normal shampoos since I started using Hairone</li>
            <li> So instead I tried it with my normal shampoo on the scalp and used this as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the Wen but a few extra pumps and you have enought to cover your hair, works just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, SLS allergy, and a very sensitive/itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly , dry Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> This really helped with the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I paid about a third of the cost of Wen, but I used 3 times as much product and still didn&#x27;t achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li> It took about two months for me to notice major changes, but I AM AMAZED,</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a little longer than using traditional shampoo and conditioner, but it is SOOO worth it!</li>
            <li> However, no other product treated all my symptoms and this one has.</li>
            <li> It has been exactly one month since using Hair One tea tree formula and there is a noticeable improvement in my dry scalp and overall volume.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to apply, and it also takes a lot of product, but it has been so worth it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely softer and much less frizzy than ever before, and this product worked better for frizz than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I stopped using all other products other than a light hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have long double-processed blonde hair, and this product is very nourishing.  </li>
            <li> There were only 2 that listed higher and both were still in the low to moderate concern range, and both were among the last ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can barely get it out of the bottle even when you take out the pump and try to squeeze it out.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde, medium long hair that, after Hair One, was bunched up in tangled nests all over my head - even after following the directions on the bottle exactly.</li>
            <li> sometimes I would wet my hair and apply the product, then brush my teeth, use the toilet, and THEN take a long shower, hoping the extra time would net me better results, and while it did improve them, planing for extra time soon became a major annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp normally and have tried many brands over the years and usually had to resort to a dandruff shampoo just to help the itchiness, however that often left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and get the \\&quot;poof\\&quot; like I normally do with lathering shampoos.</li>
            <li> Even after the first couple uses, I could feel some added volume and an ever so slight increase in vivacity to my hair.</li>
            <li> I actually used this product in combination with the Jojoba formula and mixed in a little of Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen but the pricetag kept me from trying it, I dont really know why though as I&#x27;ve plopped down obscene amounts of money on special conditioners in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can say that my hair was clean and it did not feel hard and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> My main problem is that my hair gets really dry, looks damaged with split ends, even if I recently got a haircut.</li>
            <li> I have to shampoo daily with medicated shampoos because of my scalp condition, and I have to say that the hair one tea tree formula controlled my scalp AND left my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I do have eczema, and this formula did not take away all of the dry scalp that I had, so I do add pure tea tree oil directly on to my scalp once to twice a week, and dry, itchy scalp is gone!!!</li>
            <li> Although this product does deliver on the conditioning as promised, it is pretty greasy and requires that I wash my hair daily - which I wasn&#x27;t doing previously.</li>
            <li> Do wish the tea tree oil was stronger as I long that invigerating feel, but so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> so i decided to dye my hair back to my natural color (dark brown) and began using HairOne for curly hair and it has completely rejuvenated my hair!</li>
            <li> I got this product about a week ago, I have natural 4a-4b type hair, I chose to get the Tea Tree formula because its for dry scalp, anywhoo after rinsing the product out</li>
            <li> You have to get used to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like typical shampoos (just remember that chemicals are responsible for foam and bubbles).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success with products in the past only for my symptoms to return.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, my husband&#x27;s hair is SUPER thick and dense.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking bouncy, not flat!</li>
            <li> Like the others have said, it&#x27;s a little on the costly side, but if you have dealt with dry scalp like I have, it&#x27;s worth every penny, plus some.</li>
            <li> For myself, I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on Wen right now because my hair needs it, but if I ever decide it&#x27;s too expensive, I&#x27;ll be going back to regular shampoo, not</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and after using this product my hair takes forever to dry, is waxy, and is the opposite of smooth.</li>
            <li> So with Hair One being Sulfate free, its a lot less harsh, and it has finally helped me manage my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I am African American, with a very thick full head of wavy hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; (a Sally&#x27;s product) but did not use that on it either to get a bare evaluation of Hair One alone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hair is brand new, now boggled down with products that are going to eventually dry out and also dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I expected my hair to be soft (but remember its for dry scalp)</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with a very scaly and flaky scalp for the past 3 years or so.</li>
            <li> But the hair spray was never completely washed out, which left a sticky residue in my bangs.</li>
            <li> Now I just wonder how long the product will last.  </li>
            <li> but my hair was so greasy after I dried it that I ended up having to wash again with a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, after two months of Wen, I really couldn&#x27;t afford another bottle (I&#x27;m really not going to miss being a student on a tight budget).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it for the last few washing s and have noticed a remarkable difference in my hair which is very important to me because I had been sick and it was looking very unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Usually I blow dry my hair and immediately flat iron it, but my hair was quite smooth after being dried even without a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I typically use it 5x a week--with the other two days being real shampoo days.  </li>
            <li> And its basically for nothing more than making the Shampoo bubbly and soapy, but its really bad for those of us with sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> My entire life I&#x27;ve had a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The price is about the same as my local beauty supply, not much of a saving but didnt have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> My face is dry, my feet are dry, my skin in general is just all dry.</li>
            <li> product does NOT cause break outs on my scalp, neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite similar but not exactly the same--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much less than the suggested number of pumps (I used 10 total) and only left the product in for 5-7 minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> She has long, thin hair down to her bottom that gets tangled really easy</li>
            <li> As for the results on my hair, Hair One doesn&#x27;t leave it as soft and shiny as Wen, and it feels just a little bit heavier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked hard to get chemicals out of my life as much as I can...</li>
            <li> I was really  hoping to at least get close to those results with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the tea tree formula or the lack of lather that has fixed the issues, but I will be buying this again as soon as my current bottle is finished!</li>
            <li> I tried using tea tree oil and it has been the only thing that remotely works to control the itch.</li>
            <li> GRANTED it&#x27;s replacing shampoo AND conditioner, AND I do have long hair.</li>
            <li> and as I dried it my hair was SOFT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a WEN user and like others, I was feeling stretched by the cost of WEN.  </li>
            <li> Im writing this review because I wouldn&#x27;t have known about HairOne if I didn&#x27;t stumble on the review someone else wrote</li>
            <li> No matter how long I rinse there is always residue in my hair once it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over a year now and wanted a replacement for shampoos with sodium lauryl and harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I even spent an extra 5 minutes rinsing at the end but to no avail.</li>
            <li> as long as they keep offering periodic pricing discounts.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to feel normal.</li>
            <li> But Tea Tree is rarely on sale, plus I wanted a smaller bottle that I could use for travel (if I buy Wen, I buy the gallon because all the smaller sizes are just too expensive per ounce).</li>
            <li> This does not stay in your hair for long however.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather use no conditioner on my long hair than this product.</li>
            <li> Good product, crap bottle.</li>
            <li> However, after following the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, my hair felt like straw or simply that the product was weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was looking for an less expensive alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending the money on WEN and continue to search for a product that will do the same or similar job as WEN for less money.</li>
            <li> My daughter only washes her long hair every other day</li>
            <li> I have only used this and the other cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t they design this with a regular cap like every other shampoo or conditioner on the market?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gotten very long.</li>
            <li> One day I did not put any product in and let my hair air dry (so no heat products were used).</li>
            <li> I have a tendency for dry scalp</li>
            <li> I am a person with dry skin all together.</li>
            <li> While using Wen for those two months, I never got flakes or itchy hair, nor did I get dry or opaque</li>
            <li> I got flakes and dry hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair One for dry scalp for 5 days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember a time when I did not have a dry, flaky, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> so I has dry hair, not anymore.</li>
            <li> I brought this because my daughter&#x27;s scalp is dry</li>
            <li> I have medium texture and thickness, but the ends are dry.</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry itchy scalp and some times even gets pimples.</li>
            <li> I used to highlight my hair often, making my hair twice as dry as it already was, using the Hair One for color treated hair helped alot</li>
            <li> For years I have been dealing with the misery of a dry, itchy, scaly, and flaking scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried about everything on the market for my DRY, ITCHY scalp.</li>
            <li> was extremely dry and tangled, and I had some hair fall out in my fingers.</li>
            <li> It helps with the dry and itching scalp.</li>
            <li> It truly helps with dry scalp just after one use.  </li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for over a week and there was no change is my dry flakey ichey scalp.  </li>
            <li> but that could be just because it is so dry here.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me that I didn&#x27;t have dandruff but dry, flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> He told me to get a shampoo formulated for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> They both work well to control dry scalp.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never had it officially analyzed or anything) and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> My new hair growing in is making my thin longer hair stand up and look funky, this really helped tame it</li>
            <li> Not only is it shiny but it calmed down my dry irritated scalp which was from another shampoo containing sulfate.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, if you&#x27;re going to spend the extra money on a cleanser rather than shampoo, it&#x27;s not really worth it to spend it on Hair One.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just for reference I have thick, curly, coarse red hair that&#x27;s cut quite short.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair and spend the recommended time massaging it in and then smoothing it out to the ends, this takes about 8-10 minutes with my long hair.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair weighed down and greasy.</li>
            <li> I also am only cleansing my hair every other day as opposed to everyday with regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a less expensive alternative to Wen, this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, it looked less damaged, but it wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure.    </li>
            <li> I am African American and have been going to the gym 5 days a week for the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Tried it last night in the shower and holy cow!</li>
            <li> I usually use a more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been so dry and damaged, as expected, but oiling on the scalp by the end of the day, with no volume.  </li>
            <li> It is about half the price, but I&#x27;ve found I have to use twice the amount to achieve the same results as Wen.  </li>
            <li> In Florida, frizzy hair is a tough issue but this tamed that right down as well.</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t the same as Wen and it makes my scalp a flaky mess in spots.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I can see with this product is the price and that it is not available in a larger container.</li>
            <li> I got out, my hair was a little tangled, but that&#x27;s nothing to alarm me given my curly mixed-race hair, I brushed out the tangles and moved along with my routine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this would be a very BAD product for me</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was just bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small bottles, and I ended up saving about 8.00 in comparison to what I generally pay online for the 36 ounce size of Wen products.  </li>
            <li> For the last few years I have had problems with my scalp, and it seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything there is to help it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed a wide tooth comb, FYI.</li>
            <li> hair seems to stay wet longer after use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> have not used regular shampoo in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used WEN, and this is not really even close.</li>
            <li> My hair wet from the shower</li>
            <li> My scalp was entirely healed after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 tries before writing review.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as wen and doesn&#x27;t feel as soft after blow drying as wen.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not good, not really sure how I feel!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain gross.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how thick it is usually other non Wen cleansing onditioners are too liquidity.</li>
            <li> Before this I had used a bunch of high end products, like Paul Mitchell tea tree, Pureology (pink bottle formula, Redkin(brown bottle), S Factor, just to name a few, and none compare to this product!!!   </li>
            <li> I have very dark, thick, long hair with a natural wave to it.</li>
            <li> I leave in a little during the winter and my hair stays soft and silky, no more frizz.</li>
            <li> Almost all shampoos, even \\&quot;sensitive scalp\\&quot; and dry scalp shampoos, use Sulfate, which is really hard and harsh on your scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coarse, curly, thick, long, and kinky.</li>
            <li> Chances are they aren&#x27;t rinsing it out well enough, I have long hair past my shoulders and it does take quite a while to get it all out because it&#x27;s such a thick formula.</li>
            <li> After the first use I was a little disappointed, my hair felt a little softer, a bit more manageable (I have overprocessed bleach blonde hair that has recently broke and thinning like crazy).  </li>
            <li> I have been using the formula for colored hair, but decided to try the other formulas.</li>
            <li> So I started looking into other options.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been falling out for years and had gotten extremely brittle</li>
            <li> but my hair seemed to be damaged due to the highlights and my curls were losing their umph</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used one that actually worked in the past.</li>
            <li> I found this product and, after reading other reviews, decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I had to use so many products just to get a brush through my hair after using it. :(</li>
            <li> I no longer use other oils, conditioners or moisturizers, it literally is all I need.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat coarse and unmanageable Asian hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only a little less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the new S&amp;G product which was worse than the Hair One and upon re-supplying my WEN also noticed the Lisa Rachel product, so I will try that also.  </li>
            <li> My hair itself didn&#x27;t feel soft, and by that, it did not feel silky or slick like it usually did post shampoo/condition, but I figured I&#x27;d see the process all the way through because if anything my hair felt</li>
            <li> It took a few months for all the dry flakes to leave, but leave they did.  </li>
            <li> currently flat iron it and can usually go almost a week without washing before I need to cleanse my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I think people who said their hair looks dull or greasy just didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough.  </li>
            <li> , though, like Wen it&#x27;s still expensive when you consider how much product you need per wash.  </li>
            <li> The WEN is sooo expensive I really wanted another alternative and just wish this was it.</li>
            <li> Once you get to the bottom, you have to smack the hell out of the bottle to get the 4/5 applications left in it that the pump couldn&#x27;t get because its so thick.  </li>
            <li> I have had a terrible time finding a shampoo that leaves my hair and scalp feeling good.</li>
            <li> so I thought this product might weight it down or build up, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it shot my confidence down quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> hair ended up feeling weighted down</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and was a little skeptical because the thought of a cleanser vs. a shampoo was a little abstract to me.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, I was looking atWen hair products and didn&#x27;t read the fine print or realize it  was an imitation, my fault.</li>
            <li> : made my hair look healthier and less damaged.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how this would work for black hair</li>
            <li> It had a slight relapse when I tried to use it every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> you DON&#x27;T even need HALF of the amount that is recommended for use on the package.</li>
            <li> (Note that it&#x27;s thicker than Wen and each pump gives you less than Wen</li>
            <li> If 5 minutes isn&#x27;t enough, that&#x27;s just ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> and I can see this working well with less course less curly hair.</li>
            <li> Slightly dissapointing.  </li>
            <li> Also, at that rate, I&#x27;ll be through this bottle in less than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly paste or glue like smell with a hint of tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use less than the recommended amounts, but I have a boy cut.  </li>
            <li> my lips swoll up turned black</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is also very long and thick and this works well on it since it is also a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have thick, relaxed, silver hair that tends to get clumpish and dry when I style at home even when I use air drying.  </li>
            <li> Why such a small bottle when you need AT LEAST 15 pumps of product for my shoulder length hair?  </li>
            <li> I have been using hairone for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I gave the Hair One a try, even though a little weary because the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather scares me a bit</li>
            <li> Some ads are a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> This product healed my dandruff immediately and helped .my hair thicken up a little bit, but it&#x27;s not at all convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t clean and condition my hair.e.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t clean and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I never really have a big problem but one day I woke up to an awful rash that spread quickly.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wash every day because without the extra shampoo at the end, my hair just felt greasy and dirty the next</li>
            <li> Blow dried and straightened hair.</li>
            <li> This time I used a pump or two of the Hair One product as a leave in conditioner, then blow dried and straightened.</li>
            <li> Untill a few years ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth on my hair.</li>
            <li> And at the end of the day, my hair was limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> The neighbors could hear her crying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now since he started using this product and his complaints have stopped along with the flakes and pimples.</li>
            <li> I just wasted 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The packaging and actual product are both poor quality.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how One Hair would perform on natural, African-American hair.</li>
            <li> After I dried my hair, I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin and scalp have been completely dried out from the measles.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had any itching problems in a few months.</li>
            <li> tried using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Just wet her hair, apply a very small amount of cleanser and let it sit until the end of the bath.  </li>
            <li> This product is a mess!</li>
            <li> product costs 60% less than Wen, and while I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, it&#x27;s hard not to compare</li>
            <li> My dandruff was so bad that I felt like it was not so much a scalp as it was a lot of layers of flakes.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that every time I washed my hair, I would get way too much hair in my comb.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about it</li>
            <li> &quot; She told me that she have been using the Hair One product for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> Although my scalp still has a small amount of flaking, it&#x27;s about 90% improved.  </li>
            <li> My roommate has been using Wen for about a year, but I can&#x27;t get past the pricetag.  </li>
            <li> I was about to buy Wen but couldn&#x27;t get past the price tag</li>
            <li> not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure product was culprit.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive enough for me to loathe or regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive enough for me to loathe or regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> Think ill stick to regular shampoo...</li>
            <li> Eventually I settled on about 10-15 pumps for my semi-long, thin hair, and I used it every other day.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;ve tried some other cleansing conditioners to find a less expensive alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a fluke, and although it was very different (no lather), I haven&#x27;t had any dry scalp issues since and my hair has not been nearly as dry or frizzy (which is saying a lot with the crazy winter wind and cold we&#x27;ve been having).  </li>
            <li> I have curly, thick, at times frizzy hair, that is quite hard to tame.</li>
            <li> I usually use organic shampoo and conditioner but it seemed to leave my hair looking dull.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the Hair One product to work like WEN, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical because my mom has a ton of ideas I find crazy, but by God if this didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It was like an unwanted shadow, unable to shake loose of this burden, until now.</li>
            <li> I just used this product after feeling my hair has been so dull.</li>
            <li> I use my wife mary kay products because she is a consultant, but for the longest time I always had a hard time managing my scalp.</li>
            <li> It smells like it and it&#x27;s hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended a product called Wen because my hair was in extremely bad shape after a bad round of at-home bleaching followed a year later by a damaging professional perm.</li>
            <li> However, if I only use this product my hair and scalp are still dirty.  </li>
            <li> I thought I could at least finish the bottle</li>
            <li> but the result were lack luster to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to say the least.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get the job done and leaves hair lifeless and icky feeling</li>
            <li> Plus, at least for me all I need is the Wen cleanser.</li>
            <li> Sucks.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> And the content is too thick to go through the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick and just doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> I am working very hard to grow my hair well past my sholders and my Hair Dresser</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work,  since I hate paying the high price for Wen.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is very small for the amount of product they want you to use in your hair.</li>
            <li> Wen might not be as expensive if I can use less of</li>
            <li> I was seriously thinking that I would either have to stop going to the gym or get a weave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now, and overall have not had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see it still contains alcohol &amp; other harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has VERY thick, dense, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has life again and my scalp is not itchy, I mean the itchiness is GONE!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> Last Saturday I forgot about this process and when I got out of the shower my hair was still filthy.  </li>
            <li> No matter what my prior attempts at trying to rid my scalp of this nuisance, it would always have the annoying scaliness...</li>
            <li> It felt worse each time.</li>
            <li> Hair type: thin and curly&lt;br /&gt;Length:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in order to get the results the commercials portray (falsely I might add).  </li>
            <li> but this one was by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> Hair One is by far the worst of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> It will do an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; job, but if you&#x27;re used to WEN, you will be a little disappointed with the results.    </li>
            <li> This, unfortunately, just itsn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Looked at WEN, but the product was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it burned my scalp yet again.</li>
            <li> Yes, my scalp was as scaly and flaky as ever (probably at its worst, actually)...</li>
            <li> Terrible product packaging obviously fulfilled by the lowest bidder.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with my oily scalp my hair looks nasty the very next day, so if I have somewhere to go</li>
            <li> I normally hate putting conditioners or whatnot as leave-in, and it can make my hair stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> I mean stupidly so.</li>
            <li> It flares up here and there, and at its worst it is extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dirty and grease.</li>
            <li> Just washed my hair and it feels dirty and greasy.</li>
            <li> The dirt and the hair one mix together into this dirty paste.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money here, and my hair feels awful.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen, but the price tag is way too painful for my budget.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Going to return it :(</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely crap packaging.</li>
            <li> Hate I ever brought the product its been 5 days</li>
            <li> My nose swoll up and became very painful to touch and</li>
            <li> I bought trying to find an alternative to WEN and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders doesn&#x27;t work, tar shampoo doesn&#x27;t work and smells terrible, and the steroid he prescribed me also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> (TERRIBLE combination)  </li>

            <li> For the last few years I have had problems with my scalp, and it seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything there is to help it. My dermatologist diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis, but I have had no luck in taming the flakes and itch. Head and Shoulders doesn&#x27;t work, tar shampoo doesn&#x27;t work and smells terrible, and the steroid he prescribed me also doesn&#x27;t work. I tried using tea tree oil and it has been the only thing that remotely works to control the itch. And this heavenly shampoo (which contains tea tree oil) has helped curb the itch and flakes! It takes a little while to apply, and it also takes a lot of product, but it has been so worth it. My scalp loves it.</li>
            <li> I used it all until the end - but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. And I followed the instructions- but hair just felt oily ... and I never have oily hair - even after 3 days of not washing it. I was a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> Another buyer noted that this helped with itchiness.  I agree.  I have had fewer scalp issues since I started using this.  I am not a fan of the pump as I think a squeeze bottle would be better suited.  Once you get to the bottom, you have to smack the hell out of the bottle to get the 4/5 applications left in it that the pump couldn&#x27;t get because its so thick.  Good product, crap bottle.</li>
            <li> I love using this Cleanser conditioner. I cant find it locally, therefore I have to order online. I was loosing too much hair, and when I switched to Hair One, my hair lose decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have item for me. :)</li>
            <li> I had been interested in Wen until reading reviews here and saw that this exists. I love how my hair feels!   My dandruff was so bad that I felt like it was not so much a scalp as it was a lot of layers of flakes. After one use I saw mass improvement. After just 2 uses the flakes are gone!  My hair has never been softer and the frizz is gone. In always humid Oregon frizz was a constant factor.  I will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as wen,but less than half the price</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  My hair has never felt softer, better conditioned, shinier.  My scalp feels clean and tingly.  It smells wonderful, and is very easy to use.  I only have to wash my hair every two or three days now.  With old-fashioned shampoo, I had to wash every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $11.99. Used it on my below shoulder length very fine fair hair and got amazing results on the first wash. Not only is it shiny but it calmed down my dry irritated scalp which was from another shampoo containing sulfate. In Florida, frizzy hair is a tough issue but this tamed that right down as well. Make sure you comb it through as suggested after working into the scalp for the best results.  My hair has never felt so soft right after shampooing. No conditioner was needed except the leave-in spray recommended before drying.  Still can&#x27;t get over how healthy my 55+ hair looks,  I&#x27;ll never go back to sulfate shampoos again.</li>
            <li> I have soooo many shampoos and conditioners in my closet. I&#x27;ve tried everything in order to get the results the commercials portray (falsely I might add).  When I saw my niece a last month, hair was so silky and shiney. I NEVER saw her hair look so beautiful! I asked her \\&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR!!\\&quot; She told me that she have been using the Hair One product for the past 3 months. I immediately went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store last month to purchase this product. I can honestly say that I will NEVER use another hair product again (except WEN)!! In just the past month of me using this product, my hair stop shedding, coming out in my comb, and, not to mention, is so much more manageable. I can&#x27;t even imagine what the WEN product will do for my hair since this product is the \\&quot;immitation\\&quot; of WEN!! I think I will try the WEN to see if it is literally possible for my hair to look even better than it alreay does. I HIGHLY recommend this product if you can&#x27;t afford the WEN!! Go Chaz!</li>
            <li> I was interested in purchasing Wen but decided to read some of the reviews before doing so. Several reviews mentioned Hair One, a cheaper but comparable product, so I went with the most cost effective. I was NOT disappointed. After the first wash with Hair One my hair felt silky smooth and looked wonderful. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it more and with each use my hair became more and more flawless. I recomend this to anyone. An amazing product.</li>
            <li> I just used this product after feeling my hair has been so dull. I usually use organic shampoo and conditioner but it seemed to leave my hair looking dull. This was great! I might still try the Wen product everyone keeps talking about when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.. which may be sooner than I would think since I seem to need a good amount of it. GRANTED it&#x27;s replacing shampoo AND conditioner, AND I do have long hair. Wen might not be as expensive if I can use less of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better when you work from the ends up as opposed as roots down.</li>
            <li> I have been sold on Hair One for a couple months now. I have been using the formula for colored hair, but decided to try the other formulas. This formula works as well as all the other formulas and has a really great cooling action on my scalp. It has Tea Tree Oil and does not leave my hair oily, but as light and full of volume as the other formulas. I am working very hard to grow my hair well past my sholders and my Hair Dresser commented the last time I received a trim regarding how healthy my hair has become since my last visit. Hair One is the only Shampoo Conditioner in my shower.</li>
            <li> I saw commercials for Wen and wanted to try it, but didn&#x27;t want to get sucked into the auto shipment program, so I decided to try this. I have very dark, thick, long hair with a natural wave to it. My main problem is that my hair gets really dry, looks damaged with split ends, even if I recently got a haircut. I wanted something to make it look healthy and smooth.    At first use, I followed directions on bottle to a T. I didn&#x27;t read directions until I was in the shower ready to use it, so I didn&#x27;t know I needed a wide tooth comb, FYI. While rinsing product out in the shower I noticed that my hair felt really soft and smooth. Used Aveeno nourish &amp; styling cream after. Blow dried and straightened hair. Overall, it looked less damaged, but it wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure.    At second use and after, I wasn&#x27;t as strict about following directions in that I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to how many pumps I was using. I just put on as much as I thought felt right. This time I used a pump or two of the Hair One product as a leave in conditioner, then blow dried and straightened. My hair still looked dry, again not a huge improvement, but better.    One day I did not put any product in and let my hair air dry (so no heat products were used). It was definitely softer and much less frizzy than ever before, and this product worked better for frizz than any other product I&#x27;ve used. But again, it wasn&#x27;t miraculously perfect hair. It was just better than before.    The best method I&#x27;ve found for styling my hair is to let it air dry for a while, then blow dry on low heat. This gives me the best combination of healthy-looking, less damaged hair that is smooth and shiny. I have not received any comments about my hair looking different from my husband or ladies at work.    I love that the dry scalp formula (haven&#x27;t tried others yet) makes your scalp feel cool and tingly. It&#x27;s very refreshing. I was really nervous that this product would make my hair feel and look greasy, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that at all. Hair always feels very clean.    Overall, this product has done what I wanted: made my hair look healthier and less damaged. It is not a miracle product that instantly adds volume and styles your hair for you. You will still need to style your hair however you want. But if you&#x27;re looking for something to smooth frizz and help repair damage, I think this is a product you should try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair One for about two weeks now and am quite pleased with the results.  I have thick, relaxed, silver hair that tends to get clumpish and dry when I style at home even when I use air drying.  I was looking for a way to get that sleek salon look in between visits and think Hair One will do the trick.  Spotted the product online while doing research on WEN conditioning cleanser.  While I still want to give WEN a try I&#x27;m not in such a hurry now... plus Hair One has a decided price advantage!    I have a tendency for dry scalp so I used the Tea Tree formulation - great tingly feeling. After first washing hair was soft, shiny and manageable even though I didn&#x27;t do my usual roller set followed by light hot brush a/o flat iron.  Being able to apply a small amount as a leave-in conditioner was an added benefit.  Subsequent washings and using my set routine resulted in all of the above along with great body. Lots of compliments on my hair have been coming my way since I&#x27;ve started using Hair One.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nine months, and my hair has completely changed for the better! Before this I had used a bunch of high end products, like Paul Mitchell tea tree, Pureology (pink bottle formula, Redkin(brown bottle), S Factor, just to name a few, and none compare to this product!!!   My hair type is medium to fine, wavy, and I stripped it about three years ago, and had major hair and scalp issues after that, and I had to cut my hair super short. Now my hair is growing longer, and it&#x27;s healthy, thicker, shiny, and almost frizz free!   It took about two months for me to notice major changes, but I AM AMAZED, even my stylist of six years asked me what was I doing with my hair because my hair is healthier then its ever been. I do have eczema, and this formula did not take away all of the dry scalp that I had, so I do add pure tea tree oil directly on to my scalp once to twice a week, and dry, itchy scalp is gone!!! You cannot go wrong with this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using hairone for a little over a year.I am African American, with a very thick full head of wavy hair. I even got my mother and sister into using this product. I LOVE IT! my hair is softer and feels better after washing.  I usually put Hairone into  my hair early in the morning, then I end up washing it out after about 3-5 hours (depends on the day) for me the longer it stays in my hair the better it feels. I have yet to use standard shampoo or conditioners, unless its all that&#x27;s left over in the house. I would suggest to give it a try if you looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, SLS allergy, and a very sensitive/itchy scalp.  I have had a terrible time finding a shampoo that leaves my hair and scalp feeling good. I also tend to over condition which has led to product buildup, and further itchiness. I tried Hair One hoping the tea tree oil and lack of SLS would be helpful to me. My hair has life again and my scalp is not itchy, I mean the itchiness is GONE!  I am here to buy more Hair One, and I hope this product is never discontinued!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Hair one makes my hair shiny and easy to style, but I can&#x27;t go as long between washings as I can with Wen.  I&#x27;m experimenting with using Wen on my scalp and Hair One on the ends.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant smell. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much. Great product overall and exceptionally great price!</li>
            <li> I am a person with dry skin all together. My face is dry, my feet are dry, my skin in general is just all dry. To help remedy most of it I use my wife mary kay products because she is a consultant, but for the longest time I always had a hard time managing my scalp. I have used tons of different shampoos, conditioners, and the likes.    It wasn&#x27;t until my brother, who is a hair dresser, saw what i was using and explained to me the problem, and why i needed to switch to this Hair One shampoo, and its a really simple reason.    Almost all shampoos, even \\&quot;sensitive scalp\\&quot; and dry scalp shampoos, use Sulfate, which is really hard and harsh on your scalp. And its basically for nothing more than making the Shampoo bubbly and soapy, but its really bad for those of us with sensitive scalps. So with Hair One being Sulfate free, its a lot less harsh, and it has finally helped me manage my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I have the driest hair and scalp and I also get a relaxer on a consistent basis. I didn&#x27;t know how this would work for black hair but I must say I&#x27;m presently surprised. I&#x27;ve dried every product for dandruff and none of them really worked as well as this did. I used it as directed. After getting out of the shower, I was surprised at how soft and manageable my hair was. I let my hair air dry and get the \\&quot;poof\\&quot; like I normally do with lathering shampoos. I guess it really is true that it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair of its much needed oils. Well I&#x27;m done with the lathering shampoos from here on out. I&#x27;m glad I FINALLY found a product that manages the dry and flakiness in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensative scalp. I mean stupidly so. Untill a few years ago I never really have a big problem but one day I woke up to an awful rash that spread quickly. I tried everything to get rid of it and finally thought maybe it was the shampoo. I was looking at Wenn when I saw this and thought.. I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m a mixed woman. 4 different races dose  not make for great hair! I love this stuff. It sooths my scalp and actually dose a good job cleaning my hair. Yes, I still have to put some product on after to keep the fro under controll but all and all it&#x27;s allot better(and cheaper) than shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a try. If you don&#x27;t like it you can always go back to the suds but, for me, I&#x27;m a life time user!</li>
            <li> I saw the WEN commercial one night, and wanted to try it but like many of you I think 30 bucks for a bottle of the stuff is ridiculous. So after reading some reviews I decided to try Hair One and I love it! The tea tree is great for my dry scalp and I never itch or have flakes and I have only been using it for a week! The smell of the tea tree isn&#x27;t great, but the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay with my hair and I put some spray in to make it smell good. It has made my hair so soft and shiny and my natural red highlights really stand out now and my hair looks beautiful! I can&#x27;t believe the transformation I&#x27;ve seen after such a short time. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this and I will never go back to shampoo again! I also tend to have oily hair and some had worried about it made their hair look greasey, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. Chances are they aren&#x27;t rinsing it out well enough, I have long hair past my shoulders and it does take quite a while to get it all out because it&#x27;s such a thick formula. But I think this would be great for any type of hair. I love it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> Great price - great product!  After one use my hair is shiny, smooth and the fly-aways are gone!  Very happy!</li>
            <li> This product worked just as well as Wen (although the Wen is thicker). I thought it smells better then the Wen tea tree, but then again, anything with tea tree oil is going to have that funky smell. I have to shampoo daily with medicated shampoos because of my scalp condition, and I have to say that the hair one tea tree formula controlled my scalp AND left my hair soft and hydrated. I bought this because I did the keratin treatment on my hair and needed a sulfate free product. This worked well on all counts ;)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, my hair feels revitalize and I no longer have a flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> It softens my hair and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been a Wen user since 2008. I bought this in a Sally&#x27;s beauty store for around $11.00 because I ran out of Wen and couldn&#x27;t afford to get more right away. I have extremley thick,course African-American hair and Wen does wonders for me. Compared to Wen Hair One is just OK. Wen is much richer and thicker and it smells a lot better than Hair One. But in a pinch Hair One will suffice. I will say that Hair One did give my hair body and cleanse just like Wen does. But my hair was much more tangeled when wet and felt drier after using a blowdryer. If you have never tried Wen you could fall in love with Hair One because it is still a million times better than traditional shampoo. I will use this again when I can&#x27;t afford Wen.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Wen after I ran out of the first one my friend gave me. So, after two months of Wen, I really couldn&#x27;t afford another bottle (I&#x27;m really not going to miss being a student on a tight budget).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of research led me to this affordable alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product costs 60% less than Wen, and while I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, it&#x27;s hard not to compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Wen, even though it was lather free, it actually left my hair feeling clean and smelling great. Even after the first couple uses, I could feel some added volume and an ever so slight increase in vivacity to my hair. (I&#x27;m a 28 year-old Indigenous Mexican male and this is my first time growing my hair to shoulder length, also, I&#x27;ve never dyed it or straighten it.) In addition, I play Rugby and practice MMA on my off-days--basically, I have to wash my hair daily or it gets too oily and smells funky. While using Wen for those two months, I never got flakes or itchy hair, nor did I get dry or opaque hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not the case with &amp;#34;Hair One Hair Cleanser and Conditioner&amp;#34;. I got flakes and dry hair one week after I made the switch, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean. To achieve closer effects to those achieved with Wen, I had to use a lot more &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34; and leave it in my hair for longer--sometimes I would wet my hair and apply the product, then brush my teeth, use the toilet, and THEN take a long shower, hoping the extra time would net me better results, and while it did improve them, planing for extra time soon became a major annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews here, it seems that this product works for many people, just not for me: Lucky me, I guess.  ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth on my hair. And the content is too thick to go through the tube.</li>
            <li> At first, when I was trying this cleanser out, I wasn&#x27;t sure. I followed the directions very specifically, it seemed like a lot of work for shampoo; but of course, when you dont need to condition after, I was soon over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, or coconut tanning oil; so if that&#x27;s what you want out of a shampoo, this shampoo isn&#x27;t for you. The tea tree scent is light, not heavy. This conditioning cleanser smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather but you can feel the formula as it&#x27;s absorbing into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got out, my hair was a little tangled, but that&#x27;s nothing to alarm me given my curly mixed-race hair, I brushed out the tangles and moved along with my routine. My hair felt CLEAN and my scalp a little cool even. My hair itself didn&#x27;t feel soft, and by that, it did not feel silky or slick like it usually did post shampoo/condition, but I figured I&#x27;d see the process all the way through because if anything my hair felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to blow dry my hair and as I dried it my hair was SOFT. Now; I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive brand everyone&#x27;s talking about so I cannot compare to that, but my hair felt clean and soft and smelled clean! Usually I blow dry my hair and immediately flat iron it, but my hair was quite smooth after being dried even without a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing what kind of results continued use brings!</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair - after washing with this cleansing conditioner, my hair was soft and had great volume. But the hair spray was never completely washed out, which left a sticky residue in my bangs. And at the end of the day, my hair was limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> I am African American and have been going to the gym 5 days a week for the past 6 months.  I noticed my hair thinning out over the last month or two, which I attributed to my workouts.  It got so bad that every time I washed my hair, I would get way too much hair in my comb.  I was seriously thinking that I would either have to stop going to the gym or get a weave.  After the first use of Hair One, I was completely sold!  I got next to no hair breakage in my comb.  The next day, the exact same thing.  I don&#x27;t know if I will every get Wen (my original intent), but for now, Hair One works for me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I leave in a little during the winter and my hair stays soft and silky, no more frizz.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair One for dry scalp for 5 days.  I can&#x27;t remember a time when I did not have a dry, flaky, itchy scalp.  I have tried many products over the years (including straight olive oil, which is super messy and time consuming), and none have had an impact on the flaking like this product.  Although my scalp still has a small amount of flaking, it&#x27;s about 90% improved.  I was concerned that this product would make my hair and scalp greasy, but as long as I take the time to make sure it is all rinsed out, I do not have any problems.  I use a round brush or flat iron to style my hair most days, and it still styles really well with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems my whole life.  After using this product only for a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement.  No flakes throughout my hair.  My scalp still had some itching, but it&#x27;s getting better every week.  It had a slight relapse when I tried to use it every 2-3 days.  I switched back to using it every day, and it&#x27;s looking good again.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was looking for an less expensive alternative to Wen. I have to say since I did not try Wen I can only compare to what Wen proposes verse what Hair One deliveres. I love Hair One. It seems to do all that Wen promises. I followed the bottle directions and from the first time using it, I noticed a difference in my hair..which is baby fine.It feels and looks thicker.It has more body and great managability. I used to use a spray in leave in detagler/conditioner, which I did not need from the first time using Hair One.I also am only cleansing my hair every other day as opposed to everyday with regular shampoo and conditioner.I stopped using all other products other than a light hair spray. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to de-tangle my daughter&#x27;s hair: didn&#x27;t work. The neighbors could hear her crying. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, price and the quality..I was going to buy Wen, but the price was to high.after reading the reviews for this product I decided to try it. I love it.it leaves my hair soft,no freeze and I like the price..I have highlights so I has dry hair, not anymore.</li>
            <li> I woke up to an informercial about Wren, researched and found Hair One.  I tried it for the first time and was a little skeptical because the thought of a cleanser vs. a shampoo was a little abstract to me. (I am a black woman, with full shoulder length, permed hair with a semipermanant rinse) who wants to make and keep my hair healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My use of Hair one: I wet my hair let it satuate with just water for 2-3 minutes, then I started to apply the Hair One, at first it just didn&#x27;t feel right because I&#x27;m used to a lather.  But when you massage it the hair for 2-3 minutes you really begin to feel the difference.  After I had it all in there and finally combed it through, I felt the sensation of the tingles and the metomophsis of my hair going from dry and lifeless to hydrant and smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so much impressed with this Sally&#x27;s product, I got a discount card (lol, I never buy membership cards).  I did not put any Hair One on after I rinsed it out because I wanted to see how it was just as a cleanser.  FYI: I also use the generic version of Chi \\&quot;GVP Silky Remedy\\&quot; (a Sally&#x27;s product) but did not use that on it either to get a bare evaluation of Hair One alone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hair is brand new, now boggled down with products that are going to eventually dry out and also dry my hair.  I would have never thought I would pay $11.99 for a bottle of hair cleanser, but I would definately recommend this product. My hair shows a difference with it, and I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased Hair One for myself and am pleased with it, yet what really pleases me is that I decided to use it on my baby, since it is less drying.  She was developing cradle cap.  I don&#x27;t have to go through the complete routine on her.  Just wet her hair, apply a very small amount of cleanser and let it sit until the end of the bath.  Her cradle cap is completely gone.  I then used it on my son who had something like cradle cap, but not quite dandruff.  It has also helped for him.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I use Wen regularly and was looking to purchase more, when I came upon the Hair One products.  I read about them and figured I would give them a try.  I actually used this product in combination with the Jojoba formula and mixed in a little of Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint.  I am very pleased.  My hair seems fuller, shinier, and has more body.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Give Hair One a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a WEN user and like others, I was feeling stretched by the cost of WEN.  I heard about ONE and decided to try it. It is basically a generic version of WEN in quality.  It will do an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; job, but if you&#x27;re used to WEN, you will be a little disappointed with the results.    WEN is a lot creamier, silkier, and you can FEEL it conditioning your hair and your fingers can glide through your hair so nicely.  With ONE, it doesn&#x27;t quite hit the same mark.  It definitely is not as conditioning as WEN, but it is a very good alternative if you can&#x27;t afford WEN since it has decent ingredients without the harsh sulfates.    My bottle has just finished but I will re-order WEN instead of buying ONE right now, maybe I will keep an extra ONE bottle if I&#x27;m waiting on my WEN shipment.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews...but I feel the need to warn everybody about this product. My hair feels dirty and grease. Just washed my hair and it feels dirty and greasy. I brought this because my daughter&#x27;s scalp is dry and I thought the tea tree oil would help with that. I always test hair products in my hair before I try it on her. I am so glad I did! This product is a mess! I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I love how easy my hair is to comb after using this product.  However, if I only use this product my hair and scalp are still dirty.  The dirt and the hair one mix together into this dirty paste.  So I&#x27;ve started using my Organix sulfate-free shampoo first to clean my hair and scalp. and then doing a rinse with the hair one. Last Saturday I forgot about this process and when I got out of the shower my hair was still filthy.  I had to wash it with the Organix.  Luckily it was still easier to comb through then it would normally be.  I would be fine with this two-step process if this shampoo wasn&#x27;t a little pricey.  I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone and then decided if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product one time and noticed such a difference in the feel of my hair. I have medium texture and thickness, but the ends are dry. This product made my entire head of hair feel silky, cleansed and conditioned. I am really amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. this is my first product review ever.</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels dirtier then before I washed it. Hair is like a helmet doesn&#x27;t move. It&#x27;s just plain gross.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money: go with the real thing (Wen). This stuff makes my hair gets knotted up in the shower. No comparison to Wen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often because I know that it&#x27;s natural oils are good for it, but that also might have been why I didn&#x27;t use this product very long. If you&#x27;re someone who washes your hair everyday, you might like it more. By the time I wash my hair, there&#x27;s a good amount of oils on it, and where this product is about not stripping your hair, by the time I was out of the shower my hair was still really o​ily and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen but the pricetag kept me from trying it, I dont really know why though as I&#x27;ve plopped down obscene amounts of money on special conditioners in the past.  After the first use I was a little disappointed, my hair felt a little softer, a bit more manageable (I have overprocessed bleach blonde hair that has recently broke and thinning like crazy).  After the second use and what really prompted me to write this review is that I had much smoother hair, it styled with ease and looked very hydrated and healthy for the first time in about two years.  My new hair growing in is making my thin longer hair stand up and look funky, this really helped tame it and I am really pleased with the results.  Now that I see how nice this has made my hair and after reading reviews I really want to try Wen now.  But for now I will continue with the Hair One and I also take Biotin, phyto hair and nail pills and biosil plus a good multivitamin because I also feel that my hair loss was due to not eating for a while due to stress and depression.  This seems like a very nice addition to my regimen to getting my gorgeous hair back.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT cause break outs on my scalp, neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite similar but not exactly the same--but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an alternative to Wen.  I have been using sulfate-free shampoos for awhile now, but my hair still just didn&#x27;t have that life or smoothness I wanted it to have.  The Wen commercials are very convincing, but it&#x27;s so expensive. I started doing some review searching and came across suggestons to try Hair One.  I started using it 2 weeks ago and I love it.  I have mostly straight (there&#x27;s a slight wave in the back), fine hair but lots of it.  Using the normal sulfate free shampoos, I have to wash my hair every other day and at the end of that 2nd day, my hair looks pretty gross.  Using Hair One, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair still looked pretty good by the end of the 2nd day, so I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every 3 days instead.  My hair is definitely softer, smoother, and easier to handle.  The color looks better too.  I got positive comments on my hair from people I see every day the very first time I used it (Your hair looks different...  Did you do soemthing to it?)  I think people who said their hair looks dull or greasy just didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough.  I spend a good 3 minutes rinsing the product out of my hair and make sure I lift the upper layers out of the way so that the under layers get a good rinsing too.  Now I just wonder how long the product will last.  I really wish it came in bigger bottles.  Looks like I might have to get a Sally membership!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and I like how soft my hair feels.  The only downfall is I feel that my hair is more wild then normal and I have to use additional products to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> My roommate has been using Wen for about a year, but I can&#x27;t get past the pricetag.  I recently ran into [[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]] on Amazon,and since it was only about $7 I thought I would try it out.  I loved it the first time I used it, although the smell is way too strong (like old woman perfume).  That first day I went onto Amazon to order more and it was no longer available check prime.  I noticed on the page that the product has been discontinued by the manufacturer- this happens way too often.  So I started looking into other options.  And I decided to order this product.  In the past I was hesitant to even spend $15 on a hair product, but since I had such great results with the other cleansing conditioner I decided it was worth it.  In many ways it has been very good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Product smells nice and not too strong- it&#x27;s minty&lt;br /&gt;Product cleans hair well&lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean on hair (kind of like Head N Shoulders used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to stay wet longer after use.&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived partly leaked out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to bother with returns, so I just used it.  When I went to use it I also noticed that the pump didn&#x27;t work.  As a result of having no pump I am using more product than I need and making a mess in my shower every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biggest Pro:&lt;br /&gt;I have not used regular shampoo in a few weeks.  I have only used this and the other cleansing conditioner.  It has been about 6 months since I&#x27;ve had my hair cut and I was really starting to need it.  When I looked at my ends every tenth or so was split.  Now it takes almost a minute to find even one split end.  Somehow my ends have repaired themselves and reformed.  I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible.  My hair looks so much healthier and it almost looks like I&#x27;ve just had a haircut.  I didn&#x27;t realize how damaging regular shampoo is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about trying acleansing conditioner please do.  This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  I just wish I&#x27;d started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> Have used this twice, works very well. I will be ordering this item as needed. Give it try and stop wasting your money on shampoo/ etc, and do your hair a favor.</li>
            <li> Always love this stuff - works as well as Wen but much less expensive and smells better!</li>
            <li> It was just OK, I am still looking for my perfect substitute for WEN products. This, unfortunately, just itsn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this product and ordering on-line saves an extra stop at beauty supply store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry itchy scalp and some times even gets pimples. I&#x27;ve done all kinds of scalp treatments on him but nothing has ever helped clear up his condition. I first purchased Hair One from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply based on there reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a try as my fingers were starting to cramp up and show signs of carpal tunnel from all the scalp massages. Literally after the first wash he expressed his scalp felt ten times better with a minty refreshing feel. It&#x27;s been a few months now since he started using this product and his complaints have stopped along with the flakes and pimples. So this product is a winner in my book....and my hands are feeling better too! Lol</li>
            <li> As always, Hair One products make my hair shiny, soft, &amp; twice as beautiful as any regular store bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair One can be bought at Sally&#x27;s, however last I checked, they didn&#x27;t have the Tea Tree Oil conditioner there &amp; I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Also, save yourself some money... you DON&#x27;T even need HALF of the amount that is recommended for use on the package. Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder blade length hair and I only need to use 3 pumps total, then I just run a pick through to disperse it better like I traditionally do with any conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Use, the amount that feels right/works for you. The recommendations feel more like a scam for sales to me...</li>
            <li> I was about to buy Wen but couldn&#x27;t get past the price tag so I did some investigating and found this product. It is a miracle! My hair had been falling out for years and had gotten extremely brittle (I&#x27;m not even 30 yet btw) and I noticed a difference by the 2nd use. The 1st use I thought it was ok but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the price, but the 2nd use made a huge impact on my hair. My hair feels like my 5 year olds hair again and it feels so natural and light. I would compare the light feeling to having 3 inches cut off your hair, there is so much stuff built up on your hair from regular shampoos and this just gets rid of it all without stripping out the moisture. Been using this about a month now and I will NEVER go back to regular shampoo. Hoping against all hope that this product never goes away cause it seems like everytime I find anything I like it&#x27;s discontinued. The tea tree oil is awesome because it cools and tingles your scalp, feels so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now and I already notice a BIG difference in my hair. My hair is soft, silky, voluminous and very manageable! Yes, it takes a little longer than using traditional shampoo and conditioner, but it is SOOO worth it! At a fraction of the cost of Wen, its well worth the price and time. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and its pretty curly so finding a good, shampoo &amp; conditioner to keep my hair moisturized has always been a struggle, when looking into Wen i was looking at reviews and someone mention HairOne, I bought a small sample packet at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply and have been using  it, ever since nearly 3 years. I used to highlight my hair often, making my hair twice as dry as it already was, using the Hair One for color treated hair helped alot but my hair seemed to be damaged due to the highlights and my curls were losing their umph so i decided to dye my hair back to my natural color (dark brown) and began using HairOne for curly hair and it has completely rejuvenated my hair! Im writing this review because I wouldn&#x27;t have known about HairOne if I didn&#x27;t stumble on the review someone else wrote so I thought I&#x27;d possibly help someone else find a great product. HairOne smells very good and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; makes your hair feel like pure silk, i barely need to run the comb through my hair because it detangles it so well after cleansing with HairOne and can also be used as a leave in conditioner, which in my case is perfect considering my hair is  very dry! I recommend HairOne to everyone I know and once you use HairOne (one time i ran out and had to use regular shampoo/conditioner) you will fall in love with what it does for you hair and won&#x27;t ever want to go back! Hope this post helped and I hope you try HairOne and enjoy it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Juanita</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Much better than the higher priced competitor</li>
            <li> Like the product, I interchange with  another product, so that I can get a different effect every week or so.</li>
            <li> Not even close to Wen.....super runny formula that left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> I just wasted 18 bucks. This product looks, feels, and smells just like noxema. It dried out my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. Reviews compare this product to Wen, are you kidding? Not even close.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed after using Hair One Tea Tree Cleanser and Conditioner how soft and manageable my hair was after just one week of use. I wash my collar length hair every day so I thought this product might weight it down or build up, but it doesn&#x27;t. I did find that I do need to wash my hair with shampoo once a week followed by using Hair One as a conditioner and leave in conditioner to get optimal results. But that is just my hair. My daughter only washes her long hair every other day and she has just been using Hair One. She is also happy with her results. The only down side I can see with this product is the price and that it is not available in a larger container. The 2 of us go through one bottle pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try WEN, but saw this product as a more reasonably priced alternative. I may still try WEN some day, but for now I am sold on Hair One.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try &amp;#34;latherless&amp;#34; shampoo because I heard it wouldn&#x27;t strip the color if you color your hair.  I bought Hair one, Loreal brand and Wen to see how they all worked.  Surprizingly, ALL of them cause a lot of hair shedding when you use them but this one was by far the worst.  It did leave my hair with lots of body but no shine. I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I thought I could at least finish the bottle but  I won&#x27;t use this anymore because of the amount of hair I shed.  (If I lose that much every time I use it I would be bald in a few months.)  This product may work well for some people but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and idea of this shampoo/conditioner, it definitely helps calm an itchy scalp.  But it didn&#x27;t help too much with the dryness.</li>
            <li> None of these cleansing conditioners work, even WEN. I&#x27;ve tried them all.....</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this cleansing conditioner but the result were lack luster to say the least. I have long thick hair and after using this product my hair takes forever to dry, is waxy, and is the opposite of smooth. No matter how long I rinse there is always residue in my hair once it dries.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair. This does a great job conditioning my hair. I like the benefits of tea tree oil, but a lot of the products that have it, tend to smell too strong. This one doesn&#x27;t. It rinses easily and does not build up. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Hair one is just like Wen, but at a 1/3 of the price.  I am not a curly girl but I use the tea tree oil for itchy scalp.  It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  Give up suds-ing shampoos and try Hair One!!!!!  I have two curly girls (who cowash) and we love this line (they use the olive oil variety).  You should definitely try if you are a curly girl!! Or if you want to get away from stripping shampoos and treat your hair with gentleness</li>
            <li> I have used Hair ONE and couldn&#x27;t get it anymore at our local store.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used WEN, and this is not really even close. It&#x27;s good in a pinch, but that&#x27;s it for me. I prefer the real thing. I use much less of the tea tree oil WEN, and my hair and scalp feel sooo much better!</li>
            <li> I got this product about a week ago, I have natural 4a-4b type hair, I chose to get the Tea Tree formula because its for dry scalp, anywhoo after rinsing the product out I expected my hair to be soft (but remember its for dry scalp) but it wasn&#x27;t. I can say that my hair was clean and it did not feel hard and crunchy.  I like the tingling of the tea tree oil on my scalp, I planned to use this product for cowashing only not as a deep conditiner or leave in.  So I give this product 3 stars not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;ve tried some other cleansing conditioners to find a less expensive alternative to Wen. Hair One is by far the worst of the cheaper ones. The packaging and actual product are both poor quality. The pump broke the second time I used it. Even before it broke, it didn&#x27;t work well. The product tangles my hair. I need to use so much of it to untangle my hair that it defeats the purpose of its cheaper price because it gets used up so quickly. There are better options for cleansing conditioner in the same price range.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair and scalp gently, but you need to use it every day to maintain a clean hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not packed in it&#x27;s own box, but just a plastic bag and so it leaked all over the packing. Going to return it :(</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was just bad. It made my scalp feel amazing and got rid of dandruff but my hair was so greasy after I dried it that I ended up having to wash again with a normal shampoo. Maybe ok to use once a week just to clear up your scalp.</li>
            <li> For years I have been dealing with the misery of a dry, itchy, scaly, and flaking scalp. Hair One has made all the difference. I noticed a big change with the first use, and my scalp was completely cured in only 3 uses. My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking too!</li>
            <li> I have 4a - 4b hair.  I&#x27;ve been natural for over a year now and wanted a replacement for shampoos with sodium lauryl and harsh chemicals.  Looked at WEN, but the product was so expensive.  I was skeptical about how One Hair would perform on natural, African-American hair. I washed my hair and could not believe how soft and manageable it was after getting out of the shower.  I&#x27;m sold, I&#x27;ll never go back.  One Hair, please do not change your product!  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have tried about everything on the market for my DRY, ITCHY scalp. I can&#x27;t think of a time in my 36 years when my head didn&#x27;t itch or have flaking. It was like an unwanted shadow, unable to shake loose of this burden, until now. I bought this at a beauty supply store along with a scalp massager and natural bristle hair brush (both are recommended for healthy scalp). Tried it last night in the shower and holy cow! It&#x27;s has a pleasant odor, you can feel it working on the scalp (not meaning to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s true), and the overall feeling of my hair and scalp was incredible afterwards. No matter what my prior attempts at trying to rid my scalp of this nuisance, it would always have the annoying scaliness...after last night&#x27;s usage of this product, I was amazed when looking in the mirror when I saw what appeared to be a normal, healthy scalp. I had my wife look too, as I was skeptical after so many attempts and years of dealing with this affliction, and she saw the same as I did, a normal, healthy scalp. Only one use, too. Like the others have said, it&#x27;s a little on the costly side, but if you have dealt with dry scalp like I have, it&#x27;s worth every penny, plus some. I don&#x27;t care if I have to buy a bottle a month, it works great and I don&#x27;t plan to use anything else. It truly is magic in a bottle. Do yourself a favor and go buy this product. I am amazed.</li>
            <li> Ok product.  Nothing like the Wen but a few extra pumps and you have enought to cover your hair, works just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has VERY thick, dense, wavy hair. He used to always use Head and Shoulders and since we&#x27;ve been married (2 years) I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural product that he likes. Pretty much every product he tries gives him dandruff so he kept going back to head and Shoulders. This is the first product that works!! His hair has been very sleek, shiny, and healthy and he has had no dandruff. I am on here to order a second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t follow the exact washing instructions which are pretty complicated. From what I can tell, it&#x27;s best to try it out and find what amount and technique works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;Again, my husband&#x27;s hair is SUPER thick and dense. I have fine, straight hair and this would be a very BAD product for me (side note, I use Living Proof Full and have had really great results).</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work,  since I hate paying the high price for Wen. I&#x27;ve used Wen for 7 months, and the results are fabulous. I was really  hoping to at least get close to those results with this product. So not close. My hair wet from the shower was extremely dry and tangled, and I had some hair fall out in my fingers. Back to Wen. I&#x27;ll be broke, but my hair will look great. I wasted money here, and my hair feels awful.</li>
            <li> The pump cap will not unlock so I can&#x27;t even use this. Have tried everything possible for about 30 minutes before giving up in utter frustration. Absolutely crap packaging. Why couldn&#x27;t they design this with a regular cap like every other shampoo or conditioner on the market? This is going back at Amazon&#x27;s expense. Piece of sh-t.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and it takes care of a host of skin problems including fever blisters.  Definitely not an &amp;#34;old wives tale&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love it !  My hair was never terrible but when I tried the Hair One product  my hair has not looked or performed like this ever. Thanks Hair One</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone! I bought it for my daughter a year ago when she had lice and we needed shampoo with tea tree oil in it to help get rid of it. After she stopped using it and used a kids shampoo/conditioner combo I could see a noticeable difference right away. She has long, thin hair down to her bottom that gets tangled really easy but this helps a great deal. I have long, thick, curly hair and I prefer this over my salon shampoo and conditioner by a lot! It conditions my hair very well and rinses out clean. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I think for all in one hair shampoos/conditioners it&#x27;s pretty good, plus safe to use.  However, I think from now on I&#x27;ll return to the ol&#x27; first shampoo and then condition with two seperate products.  Do wish the tea tree oil was stronger as I long that invigerating feel, but so far no complaints.  It seems to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love no suds  shampoo. I usually use a more expensive brand.  I have found this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> This product makes your scalp feel nice and tingly, but I do not like the smell.  It smells exactly like Campho-Phenique, like a medicine smell.  Also, it is too soon to tell for sure, but my first impression is that it is making my hair oilier.</li>
            <li> Good substitute for Wen. I was surprised how thick it is usually other non Wen cleansing onditioners are too liquidity. Great for dry hair. I have fine hair and will use it once a week. Almost feels like a hair mask.</li>
            <li> Great product, but does require a lot of washing!</li>
            <li> According to the directions you need to use a lot of this product.  I didn&#x27;t like that, it seemed to give me a lot of build up on my scalp and my head just did not feel clean.  I will stick with regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to having no lather, but if you follow the directions, you&#x27;ll like the results!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for not just a weightless conditioner but for your scalp. My daughter has a skin condition and we have been using this for the last 2 years. It helps with the dry and itching scalp.</li>
            <li> I only use Hair One products and this one works well for when my scalp needs extra attention.</li>
            <li> Found it a bit heavy and difficult to rinse out but it is noticeably gentler on the hair and does a good job of eliminating tangles.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended a product called Wen because my hair was in extremely bad shape after a bad round of at-home bleaching followed a year later by a damaging professional perm. When I looked up the product online, however, I decided to instead order Hair One, which I was led to believe would be pretty comparable.  My one bottle lasted me about 2 months, and I tried using varying amounts of it... Eventually I settled on about 10-15 pumps for my semi-long, thin hair, and I used it every other day. (Note that it&#x27;s thicker than Wen and each pump gives you less than Wen - this accounts for the differences in amounts you use.)  I liked it better than my regular shampoo and conditioner combinations at first, but I also felt the need to use some leave-in product and spray-on oil afterwards because my hair was just never as smooth as I wanted it to be. And I did notice that it also seemed to get extra greasy over the course of the day I didn&#x27;t wash it.  I have since gone on to try Wen, and I very much prefer it. Wen left my hair light, soft, and so tangle-free that I can easily run a comb through after the shower (unlike Hair One). In my opinion, if you&#x27;re going to spend the extra money on a cleanser rather than shampoo, it&#x27;s not really worth it to spend it on Hair One. For myself, I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on Wen right now because my hair needs it, but if I ever decide it&#x27;s too expensive, I&#x27;ll be going back to regular shampoo, not Hair One.</li>
            <li> The pumps on these don&#x27;t always work well but I love the product. So much cheaper than WEN!</li>
            <li> I have been using wen for about 2 years and I love it, but thought I would try hair. One tea tree oil. It is not as thick as wen and doesn&#x27;t feel as soft after blow drying as wen. Plus you have to use so much I&#x27;ll be able to get about 5 washes from these small bottles. Yes wen is more pricey but you can buy 16oz or32oz which last about 2 months...so I figure the prices would be about the same if I have to buy hair one every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It truly helps with dry scalp just after one use.  I love it! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and full of body, and my scalp itch free which is remarkable since I have scalp psoriasis and I&#x27;m very hesitant to try new products. This one is a keeper! I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I LOVE this product! My entire life I&#x27;ve had a dry, itchy scalp. I thought it was just something I&#x27;d have to live with until I heard someone talk about using a sulfate free shampoo. This one was the cheapest I could find so I decided to try it. My scalp was entirely healed after just a few uses. I&#x27;ve tried to go back to normal shampoos since I started using Hairone and it immediately destroys my scalp all over again. I even tried using different, more pricey sulfate free shampoos (pureology and redkin). They didn&#x27;t damage my scalp as fast, but eventually, I was itching again. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use a different shampoo again.My hair is also very long and thick and this works well on it since it is also a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for the last year and was looking for a comparable cheaper product. After one weeks use I have noticed my hair is softer and has a lot more shine compared to using Wen. I am very happy with the results and this product is a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a natural shampoo that would make my hair calm down. I have curly, thick, at times frizzy hair, that is quite hard to tame. I was hesitant to use this for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The words &amp;#34;propyl&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;butyl&amp;#34; in the ingredient list - which means they are oil derived. I&#x27;ve worked hard to get chemicals out of my life as much as I can...However, I noticed those ingredients were low on Hair One&#x27;s ingredient list (indicating low levels) and I looked each chemical up in the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s, &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34; database (which I highly recommend, btw) and most ingredients were 1&#x27;s or 0&#x27;s in their safety listing system. There were only 2 that listed higher and both were still in the low to moderate concern range, and both were among the last ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The amount of product required for one wash. Yes, you have to use a lot of this product, especially if you have a lot of hair, like me. But I find that my hair stays silky looking and soft for much longer than after &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos. Therefore, I only need to wash once a week now, which is a HUGE improvement as the whole hair washing thing is a long ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a shampoo/conditioner combo. I&#x27;d never used one that actually worked in the past. But this is a completely different ballgame...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report, after 2 washings, that it has transformed my hair. Really. And the cost compared to Wen is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this product will work great for every type of hair. You have to get used to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like typical shampoos (just remember that chemicals are responsible for foam and bubbles). But if you have super curly, kinky, or thick hair with a tendency to frizziness, you&#x27;ll probably love it as I do!</li>
            <li> I have been using HAIR ONE for about 2 years now. I like it very much. It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft. Sometimes I do need a leave in conditioner or oil.</li>
            <li> So I followed the instruction and did what they said, but after like a week of using it I got up one day started brushing my hair and I had white stuff all in my hair. I was horrified to say the least. I went in started the tub and got in and used my regular shampoo and conditioner. I scrub the heck out of my hair and soaked it. When I got out it was all gone. All I can think of is it built up. I did like they said and made sure to rinse really well afterwards, but it still built up in my hair. Also the bottle is very small for the amount of product they want you to use in your hair. 10 pumps or more is just crazy after just that week of using it, it was pretty much all gone. I had medium length hair, not real thick. I was very excited to use it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> It has been exactly one month since using Hair One tea tree formula and there is a noticeable improvement in my dry scalp and overall volume. However, after following the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, my hair felt like straw or simply that the product was weighing it down. I even spent an extra 5 minutes rinsing at the end but to no avail. Loved the way my hair would easily comb through and how much healthier it looked but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of all that build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using sulfate free for years, now after rinsing I follow up with Jonathan Antin moisturizing shampoo (sulfate free) and it completely removed the Hair One build up. The results are much better than before. I no longer have to wash every day because without the extra shampoo at the end, my hair just felt greasy and dirty the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other reviews also experienced this problem and I can assure you that it has nothing to do with how much you rinse. If 5 minutes isn&#x27;t enough, that&#x27;s just ridiculous.  Overall I do like the product although I would love to try WEN someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have since downgraded to 3 stars because my hair just feels like straw after using this. I do like the volume and ease of being able to comb through but i really wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was experiencing a very itchy scalp (no dandruff, just dryness). I had used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Trea Oil formula at a friend&#x27;s house but couldn&#x27;t afford it for myself. I found this product and, after reading other reviews, decided to try it. After only three uses, my itchy scalp was healed! The conditioner is very soothing on my scalp and has a hot/cold/minty feeling while it&#x27;s on. It leaves my hair detangled, incredibly smooth, and smelling great (no sulfur smell like some of the other products have). I now only have to use it about once a week to maintain the moisture in my scalp. I love this and will definitely buy more when mine runs out. Decent price too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for over a week and there was no change is my dry flakey ichey scalp.  I do not recommend this product at all..</li>
            <li> This is similar to When products without the auto-ship hassle.  The Tea Tree &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; cleared up my eczema (cradle cap lol) and keeps my hair moisturized here in the desert climate.  It tingles on your scalp so you know it is working.  I have to add water to the bottle once it gets down to 1/4 full but that could be just because it is so dry here.  I use it exclusively now.  Also tried the jojoba oil &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for color treated hair and it is good too but without the tingle.  This is a gr8 product!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make my hair particularly shiny, soft, manageable, or anything else fantastic, BUT it did clear up my dry scalp.  There&#x27;s a plus.  Was hoping for more of a Wen experience (based on other reviews) but maybe I just need a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*le sigh*</li>
            <li> I tried Hair One as an alternative to a more expensive, similar type of product. This is not a bad product, so if your budget needs tightening, this is a good choice. I did not find that it was quite as good as my other brand, so I&#x27;ve gone back to it...as long as they keep offering periodic pricing discounts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy/red scalp for close to over a year, it would come and go and to be honest it shot my confidence down quite a bit.  I sought medical advice and all I got was \\&quot;it&#x27;s just dandruff, Head and Shoulders should do\\&quot; but that was never enough.  My mother called me up and told me about Hair One and that it worked for a friend.  I was pretty skeptical because my mom has a ton of ideas I find crazy, but by God if this didn&#x27;t work.  I gave it 2 days and my scalp/forehead/face was completely free of redness.  It&#x27;s pretty incredible and I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.  Yeah I understand it&#x27;s 10 bucks a bottle but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to feel normal.</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong, it leaves my hair feeling like straw</li>
            <li> I prefer Wen over this. Some people think it is a good replacement but I can tell the difference and I wouldn&#x27;t even reorder this one to use on the dog. It just doesn&#x27;t get the job done and leaves hair lifeless and icky feeling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review on any product, but I feel like I should on this one.  I&#x27;ve been putting blonde highlights in my hair for a good 7 years now.  It&#x27;s always been so dry and damaged, as expected, but oiling on the scalp by the end of the day, with no volume.  (TERRIBLE combination)  I&#x27;ve litterly tried every shampoo you can imagine to try and get some body, softness, and get of the oil I&#x27;d experience by midday.  I gave the Hair One a try, even though a little weary because the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather scares me a bit (I&#x27;m a clean freak).  After I dried my hair, I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.  It has never been softer or more healthier.  For the first time in years, my hair is healthy and you can&#x27;t even tell the years of damage I put it through.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair.  I love it.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will say I do like this one as well as Wen.  I don&#x27;t like the small bottles, and I ended up saving about 8.00 in comparison to what I generally pay online for the 36 ounce size of Wen products.  This is only a 12 oz bottle for 11.00 and shipping.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair stuff i have ever tried it doesnt damage my hair at all like most hair products have in the past</li>
            <li> I have used Hair One for over 2 years now.  My dermatologist told me that I didn&#x27;t have dandruff but dry, flaky scalp.  (I always thought it was the same).  He told me to get a shampoo formulated for dry scalp.  I tried over 6 products but nothing seems to make much of a difference.  I found Hair One on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It took a few months for all the dry flakes to leave, but leave they did.  I use it just twice a week.  I am so happy it tried it, no more embarrassing flakes and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. I gave it 5 tries before writing review. I have very curly , dry Caucasian hair. There is NO WAY I could use this without conditioner !!! I don&#x27;t feel it made my hair any softer, definitely did not take out tangles. My hair was also falling out quite a bit... But I&#x27;m not sure product was culprit. My scalp did feel good and  refreshed and I can see this working well with less course less curly hair. Maybe this would be good for bouncy curls, but not for kinky curls. I had to use so many products just to get a brush through my hair after using it. :(</li>
            <li> Great for my hair which is completely grey. Nice conditioning and helps get the stiffness out of my hair. I would recomend to anyone. Good price and value too.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine, hair that tangles easily. She has been using this for about two weeks and asked me to order more, because it works so well.</li>
            <li> This really helped with the dry skin. The only thing i didnt like about it was that my hair got oily quickly after. I have found that if you use this first and rinse well, then shampoo with your normal shampoo, you still help the dry skin but wont leave your roots oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M STILL WAITING FOR THE MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year and I love it. But Tea Tree is rarely on sale, plus I wanted a smaller bottle that I could use for travel (if I buy Wen, I buy the gallon because all the smaller sizes are just too expensive per ounce). Hair One is a good alternative and the price is about the same as similar salon shampoos. I don&#x27;t find a real difference between the two, except that Wen is thicker. They both work well to control dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was great. My skin and scalp have been completely dried out from the measles. But now, using the same directions that takes FOREVER, it leaves my hair all oily. I also bought the almond one for when my scalp is normal, so I might switch to that and see.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is awesome.  I have fine thin hair cut into a cute a-line bob. I buy it because I can&#x27;t afford Wen. I have used it, and it only, for a month now. My hair is so incredibly soft. My ends are very soft. However, with regular shampoo my ends get crunchy. I wash my hair everyday. It&#x27;s so safe to use. I love it. And sometimes my scalp develops red pimples/sores. This product heals them. That&#x27;s why I get the tea tree formula. I will tell you this: I bought Wen recently because it was $20 with all these extras and free shipping as a promo, and the Hair One performs just as well. Just as well. And I compared the list of ingredients and they are very similar. Wen is $30 for 16 oz. Hair One is $10-12 for 12 oz. Oh! I recently picked up two more bottles of Hair One at Bealls Outlet for $7.99! It was awesome. And I follow the directions on the bottle, with my own discretion to my hair length and texture.  : )</li>
            <li> I was really excited to discover a non-shampoo cleansing product. My hair is a type 3b or 3c (I&#x27;ve never had it officially analyzed or anything) and extremely dry. It&#x27;s coarse, curly, thick, long, and kinky. I used to wear it very, very short in order to be able to wash and go. But I&#x27;ve since stopped having it cut and it&#x27;s gotten very long. Until growing it out, I had no prior knowledge of how to straighten, relax, or even really take care of my hair. I&#x27;ve been woefully ignorant to the sheer volume of products and devices women use in order to straighten or curl or perm their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently flat iron it and can usually go almost a week without washing before I need to cleanse my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many ways to keep it from drying out. I&#x27;ve tried every oil and product and conditioner you can imagine. Nothing has really been effective. I was so hopeful that Hair One would be the thing that did it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find this product was especially helpful. After using it, my hair felt oily, which is practically the first time in my life my hair has EVER felt oily. I tried it again, a couple more times, assuming, perhaps, it would just take my hair time to adjust to using a cleansing conditioner. It felt worse each time. Sort of like, rather than washing my hair, I just kept getting dirty hair wet and adding more and more conditioner. I don&#x27;t know where the \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; part came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since started using it strictly as a conditioner. I wash my hair once, maybe twice a week [in hot weather], then use a regular conditioner and add the Hair One after rinsing. I have left a bit in on the ends as a leave-in conditioner. I have gone back to my three dollar bottle of sulfate-free Trader Joe&#x27;s shampoo and it has been more effective for me. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t end up going with the forty-dollar bottle of Wen, which was originally recommended to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars because, though it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s not necessarily terrible. It wasn&#x27;t expensive enough for me to loathe or regret purchasing it. I&#x27;m just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t clean and condition my hair.e. It wasn&#x27;t expensive enough for me to loathe or regret purchasing it. I&#x27;m just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t clean and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very greasy as opposed to soft and silky. Doubt I will use it again as it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Not a fan...tea tree oil scent is too light...not invigorating like others I&#x27;ve used. Be sure to read ingredients. Includes alcohol. Not as natural as expected.</li>
            <li> used it for the last few washing s and have noticed a remarkable difference in my hair which is very important to me because I had been sick and it was looking very unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me but when I used this the first time it burned my scalp for a while.  While it was in the burning started so I quickly rinsed it out, even after it was rinsed out it burned for a good 10-15 minutes after that.  I tried it again as a second chance... unfortunately it burned my scalp yet again.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be an inexpensive Wen alternative.  It&#x27;s not.  I paid about a third of the cost of Wen, but I used 3 times as much product and still didn&#x27;t achieve the same results.  I discovered Wen about 6 months ago.  I have worn my hair short for most of my 40+ years because I can&#x27;t stand combing it out.  I have now grown it to the middle of my back.  My husband loves to run his fingers through it.  It&#x27;s soft, smooth and tangle free.  It would have been great if this product had worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim one day at a beauty supply store. I didn&#x27;t like how my hair came out when used it on my whole head scalp included. I have finer hair and it made it too greasy. So instead I tried it with my normal shampoo on the scalp and used this as a deep conditioner. I love it. My hair does ont have that straw feeling. I suggest this as more of a conditioner than an all over cleanser.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair oily. Will not recommend for anyone. I bought trying to find an alternative to WEN and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp normally and have tried many brands over the years and usually had to resort to a dandruff shampoo just to help the itchiness, however that often left my hair dry.  I tried this on a fluke, and although it was very different (no lather), I haven&#x27;t had any dry scalp issues since and my hair has not been nearly as dry or frizzy (which is saying a lot with the crazy winter wind and cold we&#x27;ve been having).  Not sure if it is the tea tree formula or the lack of lather that has fixed the issues, but I will be buying this again as soon as my current bottle is finished!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but did not meet my needs&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as a regular shampoo, just&lt;br /&gt;not one to add moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen, but the price tag is way too painful for my budget.  Hair one is an okay substitute.  It&#x27;s definitely not as thick and creamy as Wen, and doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice.  As for the results on my hair, Hair One doesn&#x27;t leave it as soft and shiny as Wen, and it feels just a little bit heavier.  It doesn&#x27;t give my hair quite as much volume and doesn&#x27;t leave it as smooth.  However, that being said, Hair One is a lot better than most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or any of that other junk.  Also, I recently cut my hair really short again (pixie cut), and this shampoo seems to work better with my hair now.  Love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out afterward.  Also, because I style my hair curly (as much curl as you get with a pixie cut), it&#x27;s important for my hair not to be stripped of its natural oils.  When I use regular shampoo with my current haircut I don&#x27;t get nearly the same texturized look as when I use sulfate free shampoos like Wen or Hair One.  So, definitely recommend this for curly girls.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, manageable, shinny.  Product is great.</li>
            <li> I am looking for more natural products for my hair.  I did not find an ingredient list before I made my purchase, simply that it was sulfate free.  I was disappointed to see it still contains alcohol &amp; other harsh ingredients.  Guess I&#x27;ll try my own homemade recipes next time.  Although this product does deliver on the conditioning as promised, it is pretty greasy and requires that I wash my hair daily - which I wasn&#x27;t doing previously.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, however after using for a couple of weeks my hair began to feel coated and heavy.  I have since changed to another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and am much happier.</li>
            <li> I think that the Wen is better, but so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nowhere near the level of wen, but it&#x27;s an ok replacement if you run out of wen and can&#x27;t get more right away. smells nice and cleans my hair, but it leaves my hair rather tangled, so i need to use another conditioning product after this, which kind of defeats the purpose for me. it&#x27;s also thicker, so you might need to mix some water with it to get it through your hair. it also takes A LOT to cover my hair, and it&#x27;s only shoulder length; the pump doesn&#x27;t release a lot of product, so i just took it off.</li>
            <li> I tried the dry scalp formula first, since my scalp gets flakey and itchy.  It has a nice smell, not too medicinal.  It made my scalp tingly and my hair feels nice and clean.  However, it did not moisturize as much as I hoped.  I have 3a/b curly hair. I followed the directions exactly.  Though my curls looked nice when air- dried, my hair did not look moisturized as the top hair was slightly frizzy and dry looking.  Slightly dissapointing.  Wen leaves my hair fully moisturized and my curls, lovely.  No frizz.  Maybe the Hair One curly formula with argan oil will perform better in my hair. I&#x27;ll try that next.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not good, not really sure how I feel!  It was very much like Wen in my opinion, though it didn&#x27;t smell quite as good and my scalp didn&#x27;t tingle quite as much - I&#x27;m okay with that, as it did perform as well for me.  I have the same confusion as with Wen, however.  Why such a small bottle when you need AT LEAST 15 pumps of product for my shoulder length hair?  Also, at that rate, I&#x27;ll be through this bottle in less than 2 weeks.  I guess I like the product, though, like Wen it&#x27;s still expensive when you consider how much product you need per wash.  Overall review - if you&#x27;re looking for a less expensive alternative to Wen, this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, I was looking atWen hair products and didn&#x27;t read the fine print or realize it  was an imitation, my fault. It&#x27;s different by a lot but it works as a leave in conditioner. Fortunately I didn&#x27;t pay as much, should have been a give away. I learned to read a little better about the products I purchase. Some ads are a little deceiving. Things happen for a reason! The shipping time was Ok.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with a very scaly and flaky scalp for the past 3 years or so. It flares up here and there, and at its worst it is extremely itchy. My only recourse when it would get super itchy had been some Benadryl and Scalpicin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the super strength dandruff shampoo helped at bit, but I would still flare up. Eventually, it stopped working altogether. Then, I switch to the coal tar dandruff shampoo. Same scenario there...helped somewhat for a while and then I was left hunting for the next thing. I tried fragrance free shampoos, cider vinegar treatments, coconut oil, simply not using any shampoo or conditioner. No luck. I came across a sulfate free and paraben free tea tree oil shampoo by Nature&#x27;s Gate that I thought was my savoir. I hadn&#x27;t had any itching problems in a few months. Yes, my scalp was as scaly and flaky as ever (probably at its worst, actually)...but I was willing to put up with it so long as I didn&#x27;t have to suffer through the unbearable itching. And then the itching came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim (desperation) when I was traveling out of town. I knew that tea tree oil had been the most successful out of all of the other attempts, and I saw its good reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, there was a noticeable difference. After the second use, it was even better. Today, after my third use I am completely flake and buildup free. I haven&#x27;t had the urge to scratch my scalp since I started using it. Of course, however, I&#x27;m cautious. I&#x27;ve had success with products in the past only for my symptoms to return. However, no other product treated all my symptoms and this one has. SO! I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic! I&#x27;m definitely happy with the product so far, especially considering that it has left my hair amazingly smooth and its noticeably less frizzy following blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just for reference I have thick, curly, coarse red hair that&#x27;s cut quite short. I&#x27;ve used much less than the suggested number of pumps (I used 10 total) and only left the product in for 5-7 minutes in the shower. If I have any symptoms return, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/23/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked this review from the original 5 stars down to 3 stars. The honeymoon phase only lasted about 1 month. The build-up returned an so did the itchiness. Also, my hair got kind of greasy and heavy right after blow drying, which was definitly something new for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched it up to using this twice a week and on my third wash using my Nature&#x27;s Gate tea tree oil shampoo. This keep the greasy feeling at bay, but I was still having problems with the scalp build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I though it would be a good idea to mix the two together right into the pump bottle. And it turned out with some pretty great results for me. For the past month I&#x27;ve had extremely soft hair that blow dries and straightens nicely with the flat iron. No issues with itch or build-up either. I hope this combo works in the long-run!...</li>
            <li> tried using it for a few weeks cause I love tea tree stuff and I had tried the olive oil stuff once before. Cause my scalp to get irritated and flaky.</li>
            <li> Have tried to use this product, but cannot get the pump to work. I have turned it left probably 100 times. Next step will be to clean up the pump and disassemble to try and use. Terrible product packaging obviously fulfilled by the lowest bidder.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat coarse and unmanageable Asian hair. I had tried Wen before, and liked the results but did not want to spend $40 on one bottle. When I found about this product, I ordered it right away because I also have problems with dry and flaky scalp. I have been using this for about a month now, and overall have not had a bad experience. It does tend to make my hair flat on the top, so what I&#x27;ve been doing is using Hair one, but every few days I add some regular shampoo at the end of my shower and do a quick lather. Keeps my hair looking bouncy, not flat! :) My complaints with Hair One is that it doesn&#x27;t really help my flaky scalp. This could vary from person to person though. It also smells very strongly of Tea Tree oil, and is medicine-y. This does not stay in your hair for long however. BUT this review would&#x27;ve been 3 stars if I hadn&#x27;t discovered it&#x27;s magical leave-in properties!! I normally hate putting conditioners or whatnot as leave-in, and it can make my hair stiff or greasy. But adding a couple pumps of this on the bottom half of my hair makes my hair look and feel soft, smooth, and healthy! Try it! :))</li>
            <li> From the second I squeezed the product in my hand I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as Wen. It&#x27;s not as thick and just doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well. I am comparing it to the standard Wen cleanser (Almond Mint). I want to mention though that usually when it comes to these products much of the end result has to do with your hair type so for some it might be better than others. I have thick, black coarse hair and Wen gives my hair an incredible amount of moisture, volume and best of all makes it soft and manageable. The end result is you would think my hair type is different from what it actually is. This product is probably better than your standard shampoo and conditioner but it doesn&#x27;t work as a leave in. As a matter of fact my hair is breaking much more than usual and I&#x27;m having to cut pieces out. Also this doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Wen. It has a slightly paste or glue like smell with a hint of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention since I see so many people pointing out that this is like Wen but 1/3 the price, that isn&#x27;t actually accurate. This comes in a 12oz bottle and Wen comes in a 16oz bottle so when you account for the 33% more you get with Wen it&#x27;s only a little less than half the price. Plus, at least for me all I need is the Wen cleanser. I no longer use other oils, conditioners or moisturizers, it literally is all I need. Try Hair One if you like for the money it&#x27;s probably not bad and may be better than what your using now but in my opinion there is a reason Wen is twice as much, a very good one at that.</li>
            <li> Hair type: thin and curly&lt;br /&gt;Length: Short/pixie&lt;br /&gt;Abuse: high. (lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  I typically use it 5x a week--with the other two days being real shampoo days.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for well over a year now and have been very very satisfied.  Be sure to transition yourself from shampoo to this no-poo.  It does take time.  I use less than the recommended amounts, but I have a boy cut.  It leaves my hair feeling soft, clean, and fragrant!  It even holds up to 10-mile-run hair and gets me squeaky clean.  Can&#x27;t be happier.  This particular smell is my absolute favorite!  Minty, with a hint of tea and earth.  I ADORE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bottle&#x27;s pump sometimes gives out towards the end of the life of the product.  Sucks.  That&#x27;s the reason for the 4-star.</li>
            <li> This is not like shampoo. There is no lather. Yet my hair felt clean. It some how feels more healthy. This came in the time it said it would, it was packaged well. The price is about the same as my local beauty supply, not much of a saving but didnt have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> love this! it works really well, and if used right makes the hair feel amazing. will buy the almond one next time.</li>
            <li> I have never been allergic to anything ever in my life until this product.  My nose swoll up and became very painful to touch and my lips swoll up turned black the skin then peeled and left red sensitve skin with irritated bumps! Hate I ever brought the product its been 5 days and im just now getting better.</li>
            <li> Just like Wen. Don&#x27;t know which came first. But this is a non lather (non sulfate?) shampoo. Makes hair soft! Rotate a regular shampoo into your routine (once a week) to deal with any build up you might get from inadequate rinsing.</li>
            <li> First discovered this at Sallys then found it on Amazon. This type of  product doesn&#x27;t cause scalp irritation on me and works as good as Wen for a fraction of the price. Make sure to add water to emulsify it when using.</li>
            <li> Like Wen, this is a great shampoo for sensitive scalps.  It is about half the price, but I&#x27;ve found I have to use twice the amount to achieve the same results as Wen.  People who claim the ingredients are the same as Wen are failing to notice the order of the ingredients.  Ingredients listed first are more abundant, and the Hair One ingredient list includes the natural extracts much farther down the list than Wen does.</li>
            <li> This is the only Hair One formula that has very similar ingredients as Wen Cleansing Conditioner. It lathers slightly and doesn&#x27;t comb through as easily, though. I have long double-processed blonde hair, and this product is very nourishing.  I will alternate it with Wen.</li>
            <li> This product healed my dandruff immediately and helped .my hair thicken up a little bit, but it&#x27;s not at all convenient.  I wet my hair and spend the recommended time massaging it in and then smoothing it out to the ends, this takes about 8-10 minutes with my long hair.  Then I clip it up for about 15-30 minutes.  Then I have to rinse it out for about another 8 minutes.  Unfortunately with my oily scalp my hair looks nasty the very next day, so if I have somewhere to go I have to wash it again.  So I like it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> easy to use, leaves hair very soft and manageable. Hydrates the scalp without too much oily residue</li>
            <li> No changes in my hair....except more oily...</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but I have very long hair and I find myself using a substantial amount of product to get the desired effect. I know this is basically a cheaper version of WEN but would it kill them to make a bigger bottle?</li>
            <li> Hair stylist said my hair was healthy and it&#x27;s much cheaper than Wen.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It gives my hair body and conditions so well.</li>
            <li> Feels like glue, looks like glue.  Can barely get it out of the bottle even when you take out the pump and try to squeeze it out.  I used it 3 times then mine went in the trash.  Sandi B.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping to find a good substitute for the expensive WEN cleansing conditioner. 1st...this is not the same as WEN. It has a different, lighter consistency and is more transparent than WEN. The ingredients are not the same. It does not work as well as WEN does. I don&#x27;t like spending the money on WEN and continue to search for a product that will do the same or similar job as WEN for less money. Also, the Hair One Tea Tree cleansing conditioner made my hair a total rat&#x27;s nest. I&#x27;m serious. I have blonde, medium long hair that, after Hair One, was bunched up in tangled nests all over my head - even after following the directions on the bottle exactly. Very drying and, again, not the same as WEN. I had high hopes for this product and might try a different formula just to make sure. Please post if you find something comparable to WEN at a more realistic price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ordered Lisa Rachel but was sent Hair One. I have long thick hair that tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and it gets so tangled. This product is amazing, I combine it with As I Am Co-Wash and CHI Silk Treatment; my hair is so much betten than with using shampoo/conditioner. I no longer have frizzy fly aways, my hair is manageable, my hair is silky and lightweight.  This is my first time using a cleansing wash and I no longer have the desire to use shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting Noxema skin cleanser in your hair. It smells like it and it&#x27;s hard to rinse out. It makes no difference to my hair and I&#x27;d rather use no conditioner on my long hair than this product. It sucks.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for my daughter with super long thick hair and she loves the smell. It will be a staple for her.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the Hair One product to work like WEN, but was disappointed. It just did not feel like the WEN product and left my hair greasy.  The WEN is sooo expensive I really wanted another alternative and just wish this was it. I&#x27;ve also tried the new S&amp;G product which was worse than the Hair One and upon re-supplying my WEN also noticed the Lisa Rachel product, so I will try that also.  I sure wish WEN could be a bit more competitive with the price. I think everybody has to try this alternatives though just to see if they work. If so, go for it!If WEN was priced lower we wouldn&#x27;t have to keep looking!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was thrilled when I received it in the mail. It took awhile to get here because of a large amazon package I ordered but it was still pretty fast shipping. I ordered this for someone who loves Wen but doesn&#x27;t like the price. After I read through many reviews I decided to give it a try and see how it goes. I hope they like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about it but I just don&#x27;t see what so special about it.  I use a sulfate free shampoo from Costco which costs the same and you get 3 times as much and get the same results.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair weighed down and greasy. It also requried way too much product to make financial sense.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen since the beginning of the year and absolutely love it.  But it&#x27;s pricy so I was on the search for an alternative.  I read the reviews of Hair One and decided to give it a try.  I  wish I could have said I loved it.  But it isn&#x27;t the same as Wen and it makes my scalp a flaky mess in spots.  I thought it would clear up on it&#x27;s own but it had not.  I started to use Wen again and the flaky scalp disappeared after a couple of washings.  I don&#x27;t know what is in Hair One to cause this.  I also used the Loreal hair cleanser and it had the same flaky scalp thing for me.  I will use Hair One until the big bottle is used up (bought it at Sally Beauty Supply) because i have a lot of it left.  But I will do 2 or 3 days of Hair One and 1 day of Wen.  It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as Wen did.  So... I&#x27;m back to scouring on line to look for Wen deals.</li>
            <li> Think ill stick to regular shampoo...hair ended up feeling weighted down</li>
            <li> I have very corse hair and a very sensitive scalp. I thought this might help, but it seemed that it stripped my hair of the natural oils.  I think it wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.  I was having difficulty brushing my hair, and needed to rewash it the next day.</li>
