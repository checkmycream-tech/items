            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, it has already paid for itself.  </li>

            <li>Great value... very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li>My mother and sister both loved the kit and are impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Gelish products (used with this lamp) cured beautifully, and lasted until I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The kit is real cute.</li>
            <li>Make sure to &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; the tips of your nails or they may lift sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy saving money by doing your own nails!!</li>

            <li>Good at home nail gel system.  </li>

            <li>I loved this kit.</li>
            <li>variety of colors are good, but I wish the \\&quot;Eternal</li>
            <li>Bought two kits as Christmas gifts for my mother and sister, and I ended up buying one for myself because the price was too good to pass up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave myself a great gel manicure on my own.</li>
            <li>I bought it since the price seemed to good to pass up.</li>
            <li>good set</li>
            <li>That might seems good</li>
            <li>Loved the color choices it came with.</li>
            <li>Anyway it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li>It also comes with very cute colors.</li>
            <li>I love this great nailuv kit .</li>
            <li>Awesome starter kit for a first time</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>After noticing my aunt&#x27;s fabulous gel nails, she told me that she bought this kit at Costco, so I figured I would try it as well because her nails looked so great.</li>
            <li>My nails look amazing just like when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li>I now regularly do my own nails, both fingers and toes, as well as my daughters.  </li>
            <li>kind of too translucent imo.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked the colors will be using it a lot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice kit.</li>
            <li>Great quality, nice colors, and an overall great investment!</li>
            <li>this is a nice nail set.</li>
            <li>I love this unit, works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were very clear, and my nails turned out beautiful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I found it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and comes with instructions.</li>
            <li>Sally brand is better for color than it&#x27;s own NailUV</li>
            <li>The nail colors aren&#x27;t great --- but the UV lamp, base/top coat and nail polish remover are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I am very pleased with the look, feel, EASY APPLICATION, and longevity of this product.</li>
            <li>love the little lamp, it works great, and it&#x27;s incredibly cute.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Before using, I make sure to do all the steps involved in a manicure.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to do all the steps in the directions, as well.  </li>
            <li>Sure, some may see it as time consuming.  </li>
            <li>There has also been many times</li>
            <li>The color payoff on the Dynamic Duo shade is beautiful!</li>
            <li>kit looks kind of cheap from the out side because of the boxing...</li>
            <li>Definitely worthwhile/ for a proud DIY girl like me!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just never been an enjoyable time for me.  </li>
            <li>But for more...</li>
            <li>More of a darkdark Tiffany blue&lt;br /&gt;--Diamonds: Takes some buildup to get opaque.</li>
            <li>Hautelook has another sale, I might contemplate buying some more colors....</li>
            <li>and I love that the base/top coat is a 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so cute</li>
            <li>was thinking I&#x27;d be able to always have a gel manicure, but that won&#x27;t be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I also purchased this at Costco for $30; I&#x27;ve had this kit for approx 8 months or more.</li>
            <li>/&gt; If you have oily nailbeds make sure to use the &amp;#34;bonder&amp;#34; included, it is alcohol and will dry/dehydrate your nail</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done about 3 more since then and the polish just ends up peeling.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can do my nails anywhere.</li>
            <li>The NailLuv gel manicure set is an okay product.</li>
            <li>This system works so much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I thought i had found a better solution.</li>
            <li>want more colors.</li>
            <li>I really love it and 2 coats did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love nailuv.  </li>
            <li>The polish could be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the kit twice, the first time I used &amp;#34;First Crush&amp;#34; and I loved the color.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice both with pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another bonus was that aside from the strong remover, most of the products don&#x27;t have that overpowering polish-smell to them which is quite nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would probably be a great product for someone who regularly does her own nails.</li>
            <li>I love the light tho, wish it was UV as well.</li>
            <li>I can easily get 2 weeks out of the gel</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts for two weeks.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product I love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and it</li>
            <li>So easy and quick!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really enjoy going and getting my nails done at a salon as I&#x27;m never quite sure how clean the place is</li>
            <li>So many different scenarios that this could come in handy!</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t really recommend buying it for someone else, I think it would be better to buy for yourself!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The brushes in the nail-polish aren&#x27;t very good either, makes it harder to do.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Just seems a bit safer not to be putting my fingers under a UV light.  </li>
            <li>her nails stay nice for over a month and this cost as much as one time at the salon .</li>
            <li>The lamp is great but the entire polish system and colors are a waist.</li>
            <li>This brand has a cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with peeling, so overall it was a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they were to make a “nail oven” that could fit both your hands, the time that it takes to do your nails would be cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so once I finished painting my nails on one hand (but before I cured them under the light)</li>
            <li>Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the light</li>
            <li>My first manicure came out pretty good</li>
            <li>My sister in-law also bought this same set because she loved using mine so much that she wanted one of her own.</li>
            <li>On my first application it shrinked while drying, so I had to apply more at the tips and cuticles which pools up making it easier to lift after about 3 days.</li>
            <li>The prep is easy and the LED light has your nails cured fast!</li>
            <li>The colours are nice even though the red is more of an orange, but a very pretty orange.</li>
            <li>only good thing is the lamp</li>
            <li>has Full sized base/top coat.</li>
            <li>Full sized bonder.</li>
            <li>it does not, which seems to be true for all gel brands.</li>
            <li>My nails came out really shiny too, even more so than when the salon does them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li>Directions are pretty easy but through trial and error</li>
            <li>so I cured 4 fingers on one hand and the thumb of the other hand simultaneously which worked great.</li>
            <li>The lamp cures well and quick.</li>
            <li>first, I thought it looked cheap because of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this lovely gel nail set!</li>
            <li>I have used this many times and I found that this is definitely a problem because the polish could chip or slip off really easily if you don’t prepare your nails correctly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the other colors will be amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the nail polish because they are so light</li>
            <li>I used the colors that came with the set a few times, but also purchased the IBD color brands here on Amazon, i have about 12 shades and they work great too</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend others to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li>, if you get this deal for the Costco price (courghthirtybuckscough), then it&#x27;s worth it for the lamp alone.  </li>
            <li>Already got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty &amp; the light is very compact &amp; portable !</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the if you have the patience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for travelling as it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li>but it does the job right away.</li>
            <li>The light is cute, small and easy to take anywhere because it runs on batteries.</li>
            <li>Completely my fault, but it was easy to clip off the excess with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>for the low price it is definately worth it, as most lamps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if your are willing to spend a little time making your nails gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It gives a good looking, long lasting, clean manicure.</li>
            <li>Along with the aesthetic qualities, there&#x27;s a reason this process is so necessary before applying gel polish, to make sure that your nails are clean and smooth so that it adheres properly.  </li>
            <li>red is more of an orange, and they need like 10 coats to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buys this again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I got the hang of it after the first time.  </li>
            <li>Can never get it to last more than three days.  </li>
            <li>Passion\\&quot; color was red as it appears on the bottle, it&#x27;s more of a orange color on despite the 3 coats.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still...I wish it didn&#x27;t shrink back and that the opacity was better on the First Crush and the Mermaid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy more colors.</li>
            <li>Most likely, I&#x27;ll probably give my nails about a 3 week break before doing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nt i&#x27;m sure they would last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it definitely could be better.</li>
            <li>I used it and it definitely worked better than it looked.</li>
            <li>Gotta make sure you only get the polish on the nail.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and my nails look</li>
            <li>and follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>cant speak to the longevity of the Nailuv at home manicure, as I just did my nails this morning, but right now they look just as good as (if not better than)</li>
            <li>Would be good for a french manicure, but it definitely takes some layering before it becomes opaque</li>
            <li>This was a problem for me because it took a much longer time for each step because you are only able to do one of your hands at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The number one thing to remember is you must prep your nails very well first.</li>
            <li>hey - I&#x27;M NOT A PROFESSIONAL  :)</li>
            <li>What a simple and easy thing to do at home for myself</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase as the lamp works, the base and top coat work and other gel colors work just fine :) So I am not confined to NailUV at all.</li>
            <li>directions are straightforward and easy to use, and it really does last two weeks; it could probably last longer if I didn&#x27;t pick at it.</li>
            <li>It has saved me so much money.</li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much from the included product, though.  </li>
            <li>I tried and it really works.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting too much from this.</li>
            <li>My only snag is that I&#x27;m not the most precise when painting my nails, and so I ended up with a little bit of overhang gel on the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li>The reddish looking color is actually Orange, the rest seems to be true to the color.</li>
            <li>for the products, they work quite well, but they could be better, The colors are bland, I don&#x27;t like them at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I got this kit, like many others, for a bit less at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light took way longer than the instructions said to properly dry my nails and even then they still felt somewhat sticky and dented a bit.</li>
            <li>A last minute date night with the husband/boyfriend, nails look a mess, and you know that there is no way you will be able to squeeze in a trip to the salon, so you slop on a quick coat of polish.  </li>
            <li>The kit is high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the results come out just as well as my usual salon did.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a lot of hand washing in addition to my personal experience that regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last more than a day for me!)</li>
            <li>It is important to follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>clear topcoat is very shiny &amp; durable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color selection included, but that is just a personal preference; I would have liked to have a red included.</li>
            <li>You might as well spend a few bucks more and get a Sally Hansen or Sensationail.</li>
            <li>I quickly looked up a few reviews and it looked like it was worth a shot, and even if it didnt work</li>
            <li>I do my left hand, then my 2 thumbs, then my right hand.</li>
            <li>Like all nail polish it looks better if you have a steady hand but in both shades I have used - Tickled Pink (a very light pink, almost nude) and Homebody Not (deep red),</li>
            <li>Next time I will be more careful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 11/15/2013 - just a small one :)&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>not sure if I love it...especially at $12?</li>
            <li>One last flaw is that it takes a lot of preparation, you have to be very careful and make sure to prep your nails (and your work area) in every way that the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li>fit the whole hand, but I&#x27;ve actually found that I can do the fingers + the thumb of my opposite hand at the same time...</li>
            <li>Kit is simple, fast, easy to use, small, and very decent quality.</li>
            <li>, I had a little overhang of gel too on one side of my nail, I also used the nail clippers to cut it off and that worked fine.</li>
            <li>My nails don&#x27;t look quite as good as when they salon does them, but I think that is because the gel is a little harder than regular polish to apply, so it takes some practice.</li>
            <li>&quot; The finish product is professional looking; my cousin got her&#x27;s done at the salon ($25) and they looked identical!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far...</li>
            <li>in mind that this is an at-home kit... if you want professional quality, go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to mold as well as a professional manicure-</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>What I really didn’t like about it was that the “nail oven” could only one hand instead of two.</li>
            <li>Other than the few problems it has, overall, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Now on my second application I applied everything very thin between cures and the result is very nice and shiny nails.</li>
            <li>matter how hard I tried and how many layers, the polish actually shrinks as it cures, revealing the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the 3 shades of pink and one blue shade?</li>
            <li>it ends up curing pretty dark taupe...</li>
            <li>I went back quickly and put a couple dabs on the tips of the nails where it had shrunk and then got them cured soon after and the white tips were not a problem at all (dont worry about there being little raised blobs on the ends of your nails...</li>
            <li>and I am getting barely any white tips!</li>
            <li>&quot;  (Tiffany green color) and \\&quot;First</li>
            <li>described as a dark mauve, but actually I think it makes me think of a more dark pink.</li>
            <li>It takes a few practice tries to get it right, but the kit does all it says it does!</li>
            <li>Should give you maybe 1 pink and 3 shades of different normal colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions do say that to remove you must soak your nails in acetone (nail polish remover), so to those who say their nails are worse that is because you are &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; them off and thus peeling off the top layer of your nail; how else do you think they adhere to your nail for so long..</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, it has already paid for itself.  </li>

            <li> My mother and sister both loved the kit and are impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gelish products (used with this lamp) cured beautifully, and lasted until I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> This was a great in-home kit.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with the kit.</li>
            <li> I am happy this kit looks beistofuk when applied, and for me lasts about 7-days.</li>

            <li> The kit is real cute.</li>
            <li> Make sure to &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; the tips of your nails or they may lift sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy saving money by doing your own nails!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use if you follow the directions !</li>
            <li> Good at home nail gel system.  </li>
            <li> The the lamp is good though.</li>
            <li> I loved this kit.</li>
            <li> variety of colors are good, but I wish the \\&quot;Eternal</li>
            <li> Bought two kits as Christmas gifts for my mother and sister, and I ended up buying one for myself because the price was too good to pass up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave myself a great gel manicure on my own.</li>
            <li> I bought it since the price seemed to good to pass up.</li>
            <li> good set</li>
            <li> That might seems good</li>
            <li> Loved the color choices it came with.</li>
            <li> Anyway it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li> It also comes with very cute colors.</li>
            <li> I love this great nailuv kit .</li>
            <li> Awesome starter kit for a first time</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> After noticing my aunt&#x27;s fabulous gel nails, she told me that she bought this kit at Costco, so I figured I would try it as well because her nails looked so great.</li>
            <li> My nails look amazing just like when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I now regularly do my own nails, both fingers and toes, as well as my daughters.  </li>
            <li> kind of too translucent imo.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked the colors will be using it a lot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit.</li>
            <li> Great quality, nice colors, and an overall great investment!</li>
            <li> this is a nice nail set.</li>
            <li> I love this unit, works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were very clear, and my nails turned out beautiful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I found it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and comes with instructions.</li>
            <li> Sally brand is better for color than it&#x27;s own NailUV</li>
            <li> The nail colors aren&#x27;t great --- but the UV lamp, base/top coat and nail polish remover are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I am very pleased with the look, feel, EASY APPLICATION, and longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> love the little lamp, it works great, and it&#x27;s incredibly cute.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Before using, I make sure to do all the steps involved in a manicure.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to do all the steps in the directions, as well.  </li>
            <li> Sure, some may see it as time consuming.  </li>
            <li> There has also been many times</li>
            <li> The color payoff on the Dynamic Duo shade is beautiful!</li>
            <li> kit looks kind of cheap from the out side because of the boxing...</li>
            <li> Definitely worthwhile/ for a proud DIY girl like me!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just never been an enjoyable time for me.  </li>
            <li> But for more...</li>
            <li> More of a darkdark Tiffany blue&lt;br /&gt;--Diamonds: Takes some buildup to get opaque.</li>
            <li> Hautelook has another sale, I might contemplate buying some more colors....</li>
            <li> and I love that the base/top coat is a 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so cute</li>
            <li> was thinking I&#x27;d be able to always have a gel manicure, but that won&#x27;t be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I also purchased this at Costco for $30; I&#x27;ve had this kit for approx 8 months or more.</li>
            <li> /&gt; If you have oily nailbeds make sure to use the &amp;#34;bonder&amp;#34; included, it is alcohol and will dry/dehydrate your nail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done about 3 more since then and the polish just ends up peeling.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can do my nails anywhere.</li>
            <li> The NailLuv gel manicure set is an okay product.</li>
            <li> This system works so much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I thought i had found a better solution.</li>
            <li> want more colors.</li>
            <li> I really love it and 2 coats did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love nailuv.  </li>
            <li> The polish could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the kit twice, the first time I used &amp;#34;First Crush&amp;#34; and I loved the color.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice both with pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another bonus was that aside from the strong remover, most of the products don&#x27;t have that overpowering polish-smell to them which is quite nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would probably be a great product for someone who regularly does her own nails.</li>
            <li> I love the light tho, wish it was UV as well.</li>
            <li> I can easily get 2 weeks out of the gel</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts for two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product I love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and it</li>
            <li> So easy and quick!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really enjoy going and getting my nails done at a salon as I&#x27;m never quite sure how clean the place is</li>
            <li> So many different scenarios that this could come in handy!</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t really recommend buying it for someone else, I think it would be better to buy for yourself!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The brushes in the nail-polish aren&#x27;t very good either, makes it harder to do.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Just seems a bit safer not to be putting my fingers under a UV light.  </li>
            <li> her nails stay nice for over a month and this cost as much as one time at the salon .</li>
            <li> The lamp is great but the entire polish system and colors are a waist.</li>
            <li> This brand has a cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with peeling, so overall it was a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they were to make a “nail oven” that could fit both your hands, the time that it takes to do your nails would be cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so once I finished painting my nails on one hand (but before I cured them under the light)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the light</li>
            <li> My first manicure came out pretty good</li>
            <li> My sister in-law also bought this same set because she loved using mine so much that she wanted one of her own.</li>
            <li> On my first application it shrinked while drying, so I had to apply more at the tips and cuticles which pools up making it easier to lift after about 3 days.</li>
            <li> The prep is easy and the LED light has your nails cured fast!</li>
            <li> The colours are nice even though the red is more of an orange, but a very pretty orange.</li>
            <li> only good thing is the lamp</li>
            <li> has Full sized base/top coat.</li>
            <li> Full sized bonder.</li>
            <li> it does not, which seems to be true for all gel brands.</li>
            <li> My nails came out really shiny too, even more so than when the salon does them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li> Directions are pretty easy but through trial and error</li>
            <li> so I cured 4 fingers on one hand and the thumb of the other hand simultaneously which worked great.</li>
            <li> The lamp cures well and quick.</li>
            <li> first, I thought it looked cheap because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this lovely gel nail set!</li>
            <li> I have used this many times and I found that this is definitely a problem because the polish could chip or slip off really easily if you don’t prepare your nails correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the other colors will be amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the nail polish because they are so light</li>
            <li> I used the colors that came with the set a few times, but also purchased the IBD color brands here on Amazon, i have about 12 shades and they work great too</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend others to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li> , if you get this deal for the Costco price (courghthirtybuckscough), then it&#x27;s worth it for the lamp alone.  </li>
            <li> Already got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty &amp; the light is very compact &amp; portable !</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the if you have the patience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for travelling as it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> but it does the job right away.</li>
            <li> The light is cute, small and easy to take anywhere because it runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> Completely my fault, but it was easy to clip off the excess with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> for the low price it is definately worth it, as most lamps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if your are willing to spend a little time making your nails gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It gives a good looking, long lasting, clean manicure.</li>
            <li> Along with the aesthetic qualities, there&#x27;s a reason this process is so necessary before applying gel polish, to make sure that your nails are clean and smooth so that it adheres properly.  </li>
            <li> red is more of an orange, and they need like 10 coats to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buys this again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I got the hang of it after the first time.  </li>
            <li> Can never get it to last more than three days.  </li>
            <li> Passion\\&quot; color was red as it appears on the bottle, it&#x27;s more of a orange color on despite the 3 coats.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still...I wish it didn&#x27;t shrink back and that the opacity was better on the First Crush and the Mermaid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy more colors.</li>
            <li> Most likely, I&#x27;ll probably give my nails about a 3 week break before doing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nt i&#x27;m sure they would last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it definitely could be better.</li>
            <li> I used it and it definitely worked better than it looked.</li>
            <li> Gotta make sure you only get the polish on the nail.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and my nails look</li>
            <li> and follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> cant speak to the longevity of the Nailuv at home manicure, as I just did my nails this morning, but right now they look just as good as (if not better than)</li>
            <li> Would be good for a french manicure, but it definitely takes some layering before it becomes opaque</li>
            <li> This was a problem for me because it took a much longer time for each step because you are only able to do one of your hands at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The number one thing to remember is you must prep your nails very well first.</li>
            <li> hey - I&#x27;M NOT A PROFESSIONAL  :)</li>
            <li> What a simple and easy thing to do at home for myself</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase as the lamp works, the base and top coat work and other gel colors work just fine :) So I am not confined to NailUV at all.</li>
            <li> directions are straightforward and easy to use, and it really does last two weeks; it could probably last longer if I didn&#x27;t pick at it.</li>
            <li> It has saved me so much money.</li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much from the included product, though.  </li>
            <li> I tried and it really works.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting too much from this.</li>
            <li> My only snag is that I&#x27;m not the most precise when painting my nails, and so I ended up with a little bit of overhang gel on the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li> The reddish looking color is actually Orange, the rest seems to be true to the color.</li>
            <li> for the products, they work quite well, but they could be better, The colors are bland, I don&#x27;t like them at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I got this kit, like many others, for a bit less at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light took way longer than the instructions said to properly dry my nails and even then they still felt somewhat sticky and dented a bit.</li>
            <li> A last minute date night with the husband/boyfriend, nails look a mess, and you know that there is no way you will be able to squeeze in a trip to the salon, so you slop on a quick coat of polish.  </li>
            <li> The kit is high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and the results come out just as well as my usual salon did.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a lot of hand washing in addition to my personal experience that regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last more than a day for me!)</li>
            <li> It is important to follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> clear topcoat is very shiny &amp; durable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color selection included, but that is just a personal preference; I would have liked to have a red included.</li>
            <li> You might as well spend a few bucks more and get a Sally Hansen or Sensationail.</li>
            <li> I quickly looked up a few reviews and it looked like it was worth a shot, and even if it didnt work</li>
            <li> I do my left hand, then my 2 thumbs, then my right hand.</li>
            <li> Like all nail polish it looks better if you have a steady hand but in both shades I have used - Tickled Pink (a very light pink, almost nude) and Homebody Not (deep red),</li>
            <li> Next time I will be more careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 11/15/2013 - just a small one :)&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> not sure if I love it...especially at $12?</li>
            <li> One last flaw is that it takes a lot of preparation, you have to be very careful and make sure to prep your nails (and your work area) in every way that the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li> fit the whole hand, but I&#x27;ve actually found that I can do the fingers + the thumb of my opposite hand at the same time...</li>
            <li> Kit is simple, fast, easy to use, small, and very decent quality.</li>
            <li> , I had a little overhang of gel too on one side of my nail, I also used the nail clippers to cut it off and that worked fine.</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t look quite as good as when they salon does them, but I think that is because the gel is a little harder than regular polish to apply, so it takes some practice.</li>
            <li> &quot; The finish product is professional looking; my cousin got her&#x27;s done at the salon ($25) and they looked identical!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far...</li>
            <li> in mind that this is an at-home kit... if you want professional quality, go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to mold as well as a professional manicure-</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> What I really didn’t like about it was that the “nail oven” could only one hand instead of two.</li>
            <li> Other than the few problems it has, overall, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Now on my second application I applied everything very thin between cures and the result is very nice and shiny nails.</li>
            <li> matter how hard I tried and how many layers, the polish actually shrinks as it cures, revealing the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the 3 shades of pink and one blue shade?</li>
            <li> it ends up curing pretty dark taupe...</li>
            <li> I went back quickly and put a couple dabs on the tips of the nails where it had shrunk and then got them cured soon after and the white tips were not a problem at all (dont worry about there being little raised blobs on the ends of your nails...</li>
            <li> and I am getting barely any white tips!</li>
            <li> &quot;  (Tiffany green color) and \\&quot;First</li>
            <li> described as a dark mauve, but actually I think it makes me think of a more dark pink.</li>
            <li> It takes a few practice tries to get it right, but the kit does all it says it does!</li>
            <li> Should give you maybe 1 pink and 3 shades of different normal colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions do say that to remove you must soak your nails in acetone (nail polish remover), so to those who say their nails are worse that is because you are &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; them off and thus peeling off the top layer of your nail; how else do you think they adhere to your nail for so long..</li>
            <li> The other colors are \\&quot;Dynamic Duo\\&quot; (mauve color), \\&quot;Diamonds R 4Ever\\&quot; (clear sparkle-glittery look), \\&quot;Merry Mermaid\\</li>
            <li> Picked this up at Costco for less than the price of one professional shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my suggestion over trying to shove your whole hand in (I have a small hand too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last just as long as a salon manicure.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because I loved the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to fit an entire hand in at one time</li>
            <li> and they are the least expensive and just as good of quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional manicurist</li>
            <li> So be extra careful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3 applications, all of which ended in major polish shrinkage immediately and lifting and peeling within a few days</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the color dark over the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I have had absolutely no problems with streaks, chipping, or peeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;---Mermaid: not precisely a Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li> so those who don&#x27;t want to have to cure a total of 4 times per round...</li>
            <li> This is total junk it works for a few times then it just stops curing the polish, total waste of money</li>
            <li> The polishes &amp; top coat is somewhat THICK, making it difficult to avoid \\&quot;glooping\\&quot; along the side edges of the nails, but</li>
            <li> The polish is a little thick so needed one practice application to learn how to apply decently.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes thin, weak nails stronger.</li>
            <li> It is a little time consuming, but given that they last two weeks, and I usually do mine every week, I&#x27;m still spending less time overall.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have this problem with other polishes.  </li>
            <li> I can do one hand, but my husband has to do the other.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my nails as other gel manicures do.</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel with, comes with batteries.</li>
            <li> So, was walking through Costco the other day and saw this there..</li>
            <li> Ive had this happen at the salon before and didnt know to clip off the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; by the cutlcles and when I showered the edges would get caught in my hair and pull up the polish, rendering the manicure pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> any other gel manicure Ive had at the salon.</li>
            <li> The base coat and top coat is dual, all in one which is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of these days I&#x27;m going to try the Nailuv colors with the Gelish base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the Gelish base and top coat</li>
            <li> It does take some time as you have to let the base coat cure, each color coat cure, then the top coat.</li>
            <li> Crush\\&quot; (pale pink color).</li>
            <li> Pale pink....</li>
            <li> It took me some practice to get my technique down.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works!</li>
            <li> see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour did shrink a little the second time I used it, but hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I bought this product at Costco for less.</li>
            <li> about half of that was prepping because I never do anything with my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and not overly complicated.</li>
            <li> I received what&#x27;s pictured, but the colors are not accurate.</li>
            <li> I kept using thinner &amp; thinner layers but the color was pale and it started peeling off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Battery powered and small.</li>
            <li> Then The Picture I Got Some Ugly Old Lady Dark Colors &amp; Spend Almost $41 On This</li>
            <li> I tried all the usual tips regarding gel manicures but none of them solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I was a little less careful with the Base coat that time, so I&#x27;m thinking that the colour shrinks to fit with the bonder and base</li>
            <li> Or else your hard work will go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> imperfections were hard to</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a sucker for the heartshaped LED lamp</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removal of the Nailuv products was DIFFICULT, and despite my care not to pull or scrape, left my nails a bit worse for wear.  </li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;ll make your nails weak, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite annoying that thumbs are left out.</li>
            <li> You have to put on very thin coats as it will peel prematurely if it is too thick.  </li>
            <li> As you can tell I did not, so it looks weird.</li>
            <li> Bought at Costco,  color always bleeds onto cuticles and polish shrinks badly.  </li>
            <li> the costco price isn&#x27;t bad to start you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Applying the bonder, base coat, and so forth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Later on I also realized that the polish is almost impossible to take off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good at home nail gel system.  Easy to use and makes thin, weak nails stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an at home Nail Gel System, and for the price, I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I love the little lamp, it works great, and it&#x27;s incredibly cute.&lt;br /&gt;As for the products, they work quite well, but they could be better, The colors are bland, I don&#x27;t like them at all.&lt;br /&gt;The red is more of an orange, and they need like 10 coats to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buys this again.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is the lamp</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the quality of this product.  It is very easy to use and the results come out just as well as my usual salon did.  I got the hang of it after the first time.  I now regularly do my own nails, both fingers and toes, as well as my daughters.  I would also like to add that I have never thought of myself as a nail artist whatsoever, I even have difficulties applying regular nail polish!  Before using, I make sure to do all the steps involved in a manicure.  Along with the aesthetic qualities, there&#x27;s a reason this process is so necessary before applying gel polish, to make sure that your nails are clean and smooth so that it adheres properly.  I make sure to do all the steps in the directions, as well.  Applying the bonder, base coat, and so forth.  I also apply 3 layers of color to my nail.  As a result, I have had absolutely no problems with streaks, chipping, or peeling.  They last just as long as a salon manicure.  I am very happy with this purchase, it has already paid for itself.  Sure, some may see it as time consuming.  Though, with the time it takes to make an appointment, drive to the salon,  and the wait, you could&#x27;ve done your nails yourself multiple times!  There has also been many times this product has saved me.  A last minute date night with the husband/boyfriend, nails look a mess, and you know that there is no way you will be able to squeeze in a trip to the salon, so you slop on a quick coat of polish.  Now here&#x27;s your solution!  So many different scenarios that this could come in handy!</li>
            <li> I love this!! It has saved me so much money. If you take your time and follow the instructions they can last up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Bought at Costco,  color always bleeds onto cuticles and polish shrinks badly.  Can never get it to last more than three days.  Don&#x27;t have this problem with other polishes.  Colors take 4-5 coats to have it be opaque and not streaky.  The the lamp is good though.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Costco for cheaper. But I to pay an annual membership so I guess it makes some sense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing to remember is you must prep your nails very well first. Like meticulously... Or else your hard work will go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails came out great. The color payoff on the Dynamic Duo shade is beautiful! I&#x27;m pretty sure the other colors will be amazing as well. The nail polish quality is great. No issues with bubbles, incomplete drying, or runniness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit looks kind of cheap from the out side because of the boxing... but it really isn&#x27;t. The price is great. The kit is high quality. And the colors are what&#x27;s trending! Definitely worthwhile/ for a proud DIY girl like me!</li>
            <li> I loved this kit. My nails literally look like if i went to go get them done. It also comes with very cute colors. The lamp is a lamp that runs off of batteries but it does the job right away. It comes with batteries. I would recommend this kit. For the price and the quality this is a deal!</li>
            <li> Awesome starter kit for a first time gel polish DIY-er as you can&#x27;t beat the price of $59 which is the price of a gel manicure and pedicure at nail salon.  The polish is a little thick so needed one practice application to learn how to apply decently.  Just wish Nailuv&#x27;s polishes were cheaper from the website.</li>
            <li> I have used this kit 3 times and have been extremely happy with the results. The prep is easy and the LED light has your nails cured fast! LED lamps are the way to go vs the potentially harmful UV lamps. My dual base/too coat reads \\&quot;cure time: 30s LED lamp 2mins UV lamp.\\&quot; The finish product is professional looking; my cousin got her&#x27;s done at the salon ($25) and they looked identical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of colors are good, but I wish the \\&quot;Eternal Passion\\&quot; color was red as it appears on the bottle, it&#x27;s more of a orange color on despite the 3 coats. The other colors are \\&quot;Dynamic Duo\\&quot; (mauve color), \\&quot;Diamonds R 4Ever\\&quot; (clear sparkle-glittery look), \\&quot;Merry Mermaid\\&quot;  (Tiffany green color) and \\&quot;First Crush\\&quot; (pale pink color). The base coat and top coat is dual, all in one which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and look forward to using it! Also, I purchased this product at Costco for $29.99, so it was a steal!!!</li>
            <li> Great nail kit for an amazing price!</li>
            <li> Bought two kits as Christmas gifts for my mother and sister, and I ended up buying one for myself because the price was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are straightforward and easy to use, and it really does last two weeks; it could probably last longer if I didn&#x27;t pick at it. My mother and sister both loved the kit and are impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color selection included, but that is just a personal preference; I would have liked to have a red included. I&#x27;ve used the kit twice, the first time I used &amp;#34;First Crush&amp;#34; and I loved the color. The second time I used &amp;#34;Eternal Passion&amp;#34; which I thought would be a red color, but it is  an orange/coral color.</li>
            <li> This item does not work at all and would like to return it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the nail polish because they are so light so I had to put on 3 coats.  I love the light tho, wish it was UV as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nailuv system for over a year and great nails every time!  I did find that if the batteries start going low you have to replace them or the gel does not set correctly.  I&#x27;m not a professional manicurist but I get compliments on my nails all the time.  I add glitter, decals, gems, etc and they look like I paid big bucks for them.  I can easily get 2 weeks out of the gel but as my nails grow out they need to be redone just for that reason.  I don&#x27;t really enjoy going and getting my nails done at a salon as I&#x27;m never quite sure how clean the place is and it&#x27;s just never been an enjoyable time for me.  So every 2 weeks I have some me time (45 minutes to an hour), put on a girly movie and pamper my nails.  I also like the fact that it is LED and not UV.  Just seems a bit safer not to be putting my fingers under a UV light.  I would recommend this product.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if your are willing to spend a little time making your nails gorgeous.</li>
            <li> So there are some pros and cons to this set and I would say for the amazon price...I wouldn&#x27;t jump, but as others have mentioned, Costco has it for thirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that price...I am likely to keep it. But for more...Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cute lamp that works&lt;br /&gt;-Battery powered and small. Thus portable.&lt;br /&gt;-Kit has Full sized base/top coat. Full sized bonder. 5 mini colors.&lt;br /&gt;---First Crush: Pale pink....kind of too translucent imo. Would be good for a french manicure, but it definitely takes some layering before it becomes opaque&lt;br /&gt;---Dynamic Duo: described as a dark mauve, but actually I think it makes me think of a more dark pink. Mauve makes me think there&#x27;s some purple in it...there&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;---Mermaid: not precisely a Tiffany blue. I think it&#x27;s darker than say China Glaze&#x27;s Audrey by quite a bit. More of a darkdark Tiffany blue&lt;br /&gt;--Diamonds: Takes some buildup to get opaque. It&#x27;s a silver glitter. It&#x27;s decent.&lt;br /&gt;--The last one is actually the only one I haven&#x27;t tested/swatched yet...but it looks red orange in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-Gel feels good, cures very bright and shiny. Feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;No matter how hard I tried and how many layers, the polish actually shrinks as it cures, revealing the tips of my nails. It&#x27;s very strange. I did 3 coats and you can still see the \\&quot;white\\&quot; of my fingernails. I even tried painting practically over and UNDER the tips but it still shrunk away revealing my whites.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t fit the whole hand, but I&#x27;ve actually found that I can do the fingers + the thumb of my opposite hand at the same time...so those who don&#x27;t want to have to cure a total of 4 times per round...that&#x27;s my suggestion over trying to shove your whole hand in (I have a small hand too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still...I wish it didn&#x27;t shrink back and that the opacity was better on the First Crush and the Mermaid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Hautelook has another sale, I might contemplate buying some more colors....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything morethan thirty...I wouldn&#x27;t keep. But for a starter gel kit? It&#x27;s not bad at all and I&#x27;m a sucker for the heartshaped LED lamp and I love that the base/top coat is a 2 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never gone gel...the costco price isn&#x27;t bad to start you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there are stronger lamps out there...and some that have plugs instead of batteries.....and some even have timers (this does not, you gotta use a separate one, like your phone)..still...the heart shape...so cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/15/2013 - just a small one :)&lt;br /&gt;Have tried sandwiching regular nail polish in between the gel base/top.....don&#x27;t do it. LOL It gets wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried a different gel color brand (sally hansen) and I am getting barely any white tips! So that&#x27;s a huge plus for me. Only downside is, like all gel bottles, it too, is quite tiny...the \\&quot;mini\\&quot; description I gave earlier is incorrect in that it implies that the gel color comes in bigger bottles...it does not, which seems to be true for all gel brands. I tried Sally&#x27;s Commander in Chic...it ends up curing pretty dark taupe...not sure if I love it...especially at $12? Meh. Trying to sandwich in RCM colors next (soon as my shipment arrives!) but so far...Sally brand is better for color than it&#x27;s own NailUV colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still. I am happy with my purchase as the lamp works, the base and top coat work and other gel colors work just fine :) So I am not confined to NailUV at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts for two weeks. I don&#x27;t like sitting in a salon and rather do it myself. Helped my nails grow out.</li>
            <li> I love this great nailuv kit . Not always do I have time to go to a nail shop and get my nails done so to have this at home and be able to get quality salon manicure and  pedicure is great!</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she loves this product now her nails stay nice for over a month and this cost as much as one time at the salon . The gift that keeps money in the pocket as well ......</li>
            <li> I got this kit, like many others, for a bit less at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 applications, all of which ended in major polish shrinkage immediately and lifting and peeling within a few days, I thought I just sucked at applying gel polish.  I was really disappointed because I loved the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided on a whim, however, to order the Gelish Basix kit and a bottle of Gelish polish, to see if maybe the product was at fault.  The Gelish products (used with this lamp) cured beautifully, and lasted until I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal of the Nailuv products was DIFFICULT, and despite my care not to pull or scrape, left my nails a bit worse for wear.  Removal of the Gelish products was a breeze, by comparison.  It required no scraping at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you get this deal for the Costco price (courghthirtybuckscough), then it&#x27;s worth it for the lamp alone.  Don&#x27;t expect much from the included product, though.  One of these days I&#x27;m going to try the Nailuv colors with the Gelish base and top coats.  Maybe the problem is the foundation, not the color itself.</li>
            <li> I love this product! If you follow the directions, the finished product is perfect! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got the Nailuv Gel System for Christmas and I quite like it. I have used it twice both with pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is an at-home kit... if you want professional quality, go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found it very easy to use. The instructions were clear and not overly complicated. Like all nail polish it looks better if you have a steady hand but in both shades I have used - Tickled Pink (a very light pink, almost nude) and Homebody Not (deep red), imperfections were hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour did shrink a little the second time I used it, but hardly noticeable. I was a little less careful with the Base coat that time, so I&#x27;m thinking that the colour shrinks to fit with the bonder and base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus was that aside from the strong remover, most of the products don&#x27;t have that overpowering polish-smell to them which is quite nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kit is simple, fast, easy to use, small, and very decent quality. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to salon visits, this at home gel nail system works great!  I would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I bought this product at Costco for less. After noticing my aunt&#x27;s fabulous gel nails, she told me that she bought this kit at Costco, so I figured I would try it as well because her nails looked so great. I did my nails yesterday and I love them! They look so shiny, like I got them done at a salon. It is a little time consuming, but given that they last two weeks, and I usually do mine every week, I&#x27;m still spending less time overall. It is important to follow the instructions carefully. My only snag is that I&#x27;m not the most precise when painting my nails, and so I ended up with a little bit of overhang gel on the edges of my nails. Completely my fault, but it was easy to clip off the excess with a nail clipper. Next time I will be more careful. Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy more colors.</li>
            <li> Liked the colors will be using it a lot</li>
            <li> This is such a great product I love it. I definitely would recommend this lovely gel nail set!</li>
            <li> Gave myself a great gel manicure on my own. My manicure lasted for about 14 days before I removed the nail polish. What a simple and easy thing to do at home for myself now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t realize with gel manicures is it&#x27;ll make your nails weak, so be prepared for that. Most likely, I&#x27;ll probably give my nails about a 3 week break before doing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking I&#x27;d be able to always have a gel manicure, but that won&#x27;t be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, what a great product. I love mine.</li>
            <li> Used it twice on myself now and once for each of my kids! Already got my monies worth.  Very easy to use and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit. Not crazy about the 3 shades of pink and one blue shade? Should give you maybe 1 pink and 3 shades of different normal colors. Other than that it works!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I also purchased this at Costco for $30; I&#x27;ve had this kit for approx 8 months or more. I used the colors that came with the set a few times, but also purchased the IBD color brands here on Amazon, i have about 12 shades and they work great too and they are the least expensive and just as good of quality. I also purchased the Gelish base and top coat once my top/base coat of the Nailuv ran out and it works even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My sister in-law also bought this same set because she loved using mine so much that she wanted one of her own. for the low price it is definately worth it, as most lamps themselves are much more expensive. This is a UV lamp so you have to use with UV polish to harden. My nails last about 7-9 days, but i do have a habit of picking at them, if i didnt i&#x27;m sure they would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions do say that to remove you must soak your nails in acetone (nail polish remover), so to those who say their nails are worse that is because you are &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; them off and thus peeling off the top layer of your nail; how else do you think they adhere to your nail for so long..duh. lol. If you follow the instructions you will have no issues.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp only fits my 4 fingers. I do my left hand, then my 2 thumbs, then my right hand. It does take some time as you have to let the base coat cure, each color coat cure, then the top coat. I don&#x27;t mind, i do mine while watching TV or a movie...&lt;br /&gt; If you have oily nailbeds make sure to use the &amp;#34;bonder&amp;#34; included, it is alcohol and will dry/dehydrate your nail so the coats can adhere to your nail.&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions about the process just YouTube DIY videos and they will walk you through step by step a visual process of doing gel nails at home. Make sure to &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; the tips of your nails or they may lift sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy saving money by doing your own nails!!</li>
            <li> The polishes &amp; top coat is somewhat THICK, making it difficult to avoid \\&quot;glooping\\&quot; along the side edges of the nails, but hey - I&#x27;M NOT A PROFESSIONAL  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear topcoat is very shiny &amp; durable.  This would probably be a great product for someone who regularly does her own nails.</li>
            <li> The Box Is All Different Then The Picture I Got Some Ugly Old Lady Dark Colors &amp; Spend Almost $41 On This This Was $39.99 Smh I&#x27;m Disappointed!</li>
            <li> This was a great in-home kit. I&#x27;ve been using the kit for about 8-months. I did not expect it to mold as well as a professional manicure- but I am happy with the kit. Everyone&#x27;s nails and oils are different and i can&#x27;t ever get simple nail polish to hold on my nails. I am happy this kit looks beistofuk when applied, and for me lasts about 7-days. (I am an athlete and mom so that&#x27;s a lot of hand washing in addition to my personal experience that regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last more than a day for me!) so I am very pleased with the look, feel, EASY APPLICATION, and longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Costco and was quite hopeful. My first manicure came out pretty good but really didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve done about 3 more since then and the polish just ends up peeling. I tried all the usual tips regarding gel manicures but none of them solved the problem. The lamp is great but the entire polish system and colors are a waist. You might as well spend a few bucks more and get a Sally Hansen or Sensationail. This brand has a cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at Costco for less than the price of one professional shellac manicure! It takes a few practice tries to get it right, but the kit does all it says it does! Great quality, nice colors, and an overall great investment!</li>
            <li> I saw this at Costco for $29.99. I bought it since the price seemed to good to pass up. I have tried it once and I am happy with the results. My nails don&#x27;t look quite as good as when they salon does them, but I think that is because the gel is a little harder than regular polish to apply, so it takes some practice. The light is cute, small and easy to take anywhere because it runs on batteries. I love it because I can do my nails anywhere. My nails came out really shiny too, even more so than when the salon does them. I have not had any issues with peeling, so overall it was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I had a little overhang of gel too on one side of my nail, I also used the nail clippers to cut it off and that worked fine.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. My polish has lasted the 2 weeks it claims. The picture is at the end of the 2 weeks. With that being said, if you want the polish to last you must follow the preparation correctly. Otherwise you will have chips. I know this because I did my daughters nails. I rushed through it and the same day the entire color peeled off the nail. Also you must watch your edges as well. As you can tell I did not, so it looks weird. It was my 1st time so now I know. The only thing I did not care for was the actual colors. I received what&#x27;s pictured, but the colors are not accurate. For example, the glitter looking polish is just a silver color. The reddish looking color is actually Orange, the rest seems to be true to the color. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> this is a nice nail set. I can do one hand, but my husband has to do the other. good set</li>
            <li> Great value... very happy I purchased this. The nail colors aren&#x27;t great --- but the UV lamp, base/top coat and nail polish remover are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The NailLuv gel manicure set is an okay product. I do like this product but it definitely could be better. I wouldn’t really recommend buying it for someone else, I think it would be better to buy for yourself! I got this product because it came with 6 colors, the UV lamp, all the base/top coats, files, and everything you need at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it looked cheap because of the packaging. I used it and it definitely worked better than it looked. What I really didn’t like about it was that the “nail oven” could only one hand instead of two. This was a problem for me because it took a much longer time for each step because you are only able to do one of your hands at a time. If they were to make a “nail oven” that could fit both your hands, the time that it takes to do your nails would be cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on I also realized that the polish is almost impossible to take off! That might seems good but once it starts to chip and you want it off, it won’t come off. You can’t just use remover, you need to file, brush, and scrape it off! One last flaw is that it takes a lot of preparation, you have to be very careful and make sure to prep your nails (and your work area) in every way that the instructions tell you to. I have used this many times and I found that this is definitely a problem because the polish could chip or slip off really easily if you don’t prepare your nails correctly. Other than the few problems it has, overall, this is a really good product. It gives a good looking, long lasting, clean manicure. I would only recommend this for girls over the age of ten.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use if you follow the directions ! The colors are pretty &amp; the light is very compact &amp; portable ! Great investment</li>
            <li> I luv this!!! My nails look amazing just like when I go to the salon. It took me some practice to get my technique down. Gotta make sure you only get the polish on the nail. If you get it on the cuticles there will be space for the nail to lift. Use the stick to go around the edges so that you don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  Great Gift!</li>
            <li> I love this unit, works great and is easy to use.  It is battery operated, so there&#x27;s no cumbersome cord.</li>
            <li> This system works so much better than I thought it would.  You have to put on very thin coats as it will peel prematurely if it is too thick.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my nails as other gel manicures do.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  The instructions were very clear, and my nails turned out beautiful!</li>
            <li> I tried this 3 times.  My nail polish came off after 3 days.  It was hard to get the color dark over the whole nail.  The color faded after a couple days.  I kept using thinner &amp; thinner layers but the color was pale and it started peeling off.  I returned it to Costco.  I was really disappointed.  I thought i had found a better solution.</li>
            <li> Works great! Small enough to travel with, comes with batteries. Loved the color choices it came with. Very easy to use and comes with instructions.I would definitely recommend others to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I tried and it really works. Easy to apply and it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I want more colors. To keep in my coleccion</li>
            <li> This is total junk it works for a few times then it just stops curing the polish, total waste of money</li>
            <li> So, was walking through Costco the other day and saw this there.. Ive had a couple of gel manicures done at the salon before but have never tried DIY. I quickly looked up a few reviews and it looked like it was worth a shot, and even if it didnt work I knew I could return it. I used it for the first time today and my nails look AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;You have to prep your nails meticulously (cuticles, shaping, cleaning, etc.) and follow the directions exactly. It took maybe 60-90 minutes from start to finish but about half of that was prepping because I never do anything with my nails.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to fit an entire hand in at one time so I cured 4 fingers on one hand and the thumb of the other hand simultaneously which worked great. I read one review stating that the polish would shrink and they always had the white tips of their nails showing. I noticed this happening as I was putting on the polish so once I finished painting my nails on one hand (but before I cured them under the light) I went back quickly and put a couple dabs on the tips of the nails where it had shrunk and then got them cured soon after and the white tips were not a problem at all (dont worry about there being little raised blobs on the ends of your nails...that blended in when I cured them.)&lt;br /&gt;There was a bit of pooling around the cuticles but I just used nail clippers to get those bits off afterwards. Ive had this happen at the salon before and didnt know to clip off the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; by the cutlcles and when I showered the edges would get caught in my hair and pull up the polish, rendering the manicure pretty much useless. The color I used was Dynamic Duo which is a deeper pink/mauve color. I really love it and 2 coats did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I cant speak to the longevity of the Nailuv at home manicure, as I just did my nails this morning, but right now they look just as good as (if not better than) any other gel manicure Ive had at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love nailuv.  My manicure lasts 2 weeks.  So easy and quick!</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting too much from this. The light took way longer than the instructions said to properly dry my nails and even then they still felt somewhat sticky and dented a bit. Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the light and it was just the products that came with it that didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. I like I got all this stuff for the same price of one application at the nail salon. Directions are pretty easy but through trial and error I realized the gel will begin to peel off if you get any of the polish on your skin. So be extra careful! I don&#x27;t like how that isn&#x27;t specified I also wish it came in a storing box that way after each use you can put it in a box that would keep the products from getting damaged.</li>
            <li> Awesome...works like a charm; fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for travelling as it&#x27;s very small but it&#x27;s quite annoying that thumbs are left out. Also instructions say to keep nails in for about 30 seconds but that&#x27;s never enough. The brushes in the nail-polish aren&#x27;t very good either, makes it harder to do. Anyway it&#x27;s a good price so it&#x27;s worth the if you have the patience.</li>
            <li> The kit is real cute. The lamp cures well and quick. The polish could be better. On my first application it shrinked while drying, so I had to apply more at the tips and cuticles which pools up making it easier to lift after about 3 days. The colours are nice even though the red is more of an orange, but a very pretty orange. Now on my second application I applied everything very thin between cures and the result is very nice and shiny nails.</li>
