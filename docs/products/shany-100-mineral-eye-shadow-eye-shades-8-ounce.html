            <li>Happy that they&#x27;re here!</li>
            <li>These were great for that purpose!  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and great quality.</li>
            <li>great selection..</li>
            <li>huge assortment of great colors!!</li>
            <li>But it will actually be good for crafting and putting color to paints rather than makeup.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Its nice but not something I reach for often</li>
            <li>nice quality..</li>
            <li>Great eyeshadows very pigmented and bright stays all day with a primer</li>
            <li>The powder itself is pretty great, but while the pigmentation is fantastic in most of the colors, some of the lighter powders just aren&#x27;t bright at all.</li>
            <li>Even the box was cute with all the colors arranged in order.</li>
            <li>I love shany cosmetics</li>
            <li>I actually made Z-palettes for my best friend as well using these shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will defnitly buy more of these when i run out though.....</li>
            <li>Overall though, this set has a nice color variety and for the most part looks great with a bit of primer.</li>
            <li>it appears to be good quaility just not enough NON bright colors.</li>
            <li>Full of toxic ingredients!  </li>
            <li>Huge success with 3 mid-20s nieces.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and i really must say that i Love this product, the colors are very vibrant and pigmented.</li>
            <li>so fun to experiment with</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Decent eye shadow, went on smooth.</li>
            <li>you have to be super super careful when opening and closing the lids to make sure they&#x27;re on tight and the powder doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere</li>
            <li>you do use them loose, make sure to use a sticky eye primer to ensure they don&#x27;t crease or have lots of fallout!</li>
            <li>Shadow went on smoothly and the wide range of colors meant everyone was able to select favorites.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This product is very pigmented and pretty.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t end up in the crease of your eye and the color is really pigmented.</li>
            <li>Made in China doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>Love the wide range of colors.  </li>
            <li>You really have to scrub, or use eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>every last color is true to color, however it has alot of fall out</li>
            <li>but I checked the tracking and was surprised to see it out for delivery!</li>
            <li>Basically trying to switch to natural make up products...</li>
            <li>so be careful about how much you decide to put on your brush.</li>
            <li>Using loose shadow like this can be a bit difficult, but with some alcohol and a pack of metal eyeshadow pans, you can create your own custom pallets.  </li>

            <li> it last long to!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product to everyone especially a beginner because there are a wide range of colors in the kit</li>
            <li> Definitely wear a base under the shadows or the color pay off won&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> I used it as stage makeup and just some advice, if you&#x27;re going to do what I did you have to select your colors very carefully and experiment with the colors to see which are pigmented enough for theater.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are way too extreme to use, but its fun if you want to be dramatic or play around.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely not 100% minerals.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not certain what I&#x27;m going to do with it yet...</li>
            <li> They keep taking down posts that tell of their lies.</li>
            <li> The colors are however as described, and the packaging is as horrible as described (20 jars stacked on 20 jars in the box with no easy way to reach the bottom 20 and not make a mess).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with pigments.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is TERRIBLE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Much higher quality than I was expecting. It doesn&#x27;t end up in the crease of your eye and the color is really pigmented. I would buy this again. Especially at the price I got it for on the lightning deal. Even the box was cute with all the colors arranged in order.</li>
            <li> This product is very pigmented and pretty. every last color is true to color, however it has alot of fall out so be careful about how much you decide to put on your brush. I would reccommend to anyone OH YA  it last long to!</li>
            <li> Basically trying to switch to natural make up products... this isn&#x27;t it - contains methylparaben, propylparaben, and chemical colorants.  Made in China doesn&#x27;t help much.  Misleading description by saying 100% mineral - parabens aren&#x27;t minerals, neither is food coloring (which it \\&quot;may contain\\&quot;).  The colors are however as described, and the packaging is as horrible as described (20 jars stacked on 20 jars in the box with no easy way to reach the bottom 20 and not make a mess).  Very disappointed.  Not certain what I&#x27;m going to do with it yet... returning things is a hassle, I&#x27;ll probably try to sell it on CL or something.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this on Friday but I checked the tracking and was surprised to see it out for delivery! I love shany cosmetics but this item has been sold out and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with pigments. Happy that they&#x27;re here!</li>
            <li> Its nice but not something I reach for often so I wish I would&#x27;ve kept my money.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted to practice creating pressed pigments.  These were great for that purpose!  Using loose shadow like this can be a bit difficult, but with some alcohol and a pack of metal eyeshadow pans, you can create your own custom pallets.  Plus there is a lot of shadow in each jar, so you can press 2-3 pans of each color.  I actually made Z-palettes for my best friend as well using these shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use them loose, make sure to use a sticky eye primer to ensure they don&#x27;t crease or have lots of fallout!</li>
            <li> great selection..nice quality.. so fun to experiment with</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t 12hour stay. Maybe if you didn&#x27;t blink. It creases just like the shadows you can get at wallmart. Some of the colors are way too extreme to use, but its fun if you want to be dramatic or play around.</li>
            <li> huge assortment of great colors!!</li>
            <li> Decent eye shadow, went on smooth. Will only use about 1/2 the colors though.</li>
            <li> Love the wide range of colors.  The only thing is I wish they had a sifter on the jars so you wouldn&#x27;t spill any product when trying to open and close the jars.  Definitely wear a base under the shadows or the color pay off won&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and i really must say that i Love this product, the colors are very vibrant and pigmented. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to get desired look. Definitely recommend this product to everyone especially a beginner because there are a wide range of colors in the kit</li>
            <li> Huge success with 3 mid-20s nieces. Shadow went on smoothly and the wide range of colors meant everyone was able to select favorites.</li>
            <li> Full of toxic ingredients!  These are absolutely not 100% minerals.  They contain food coloring, preservatives, and additives that are harmful to your body.  Read the label--this company lies!!!  They keep taking down posts that tell of their lies.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.  But it will actually be good for crafting and putting color to paints rather than makeup.  I give it a 3 stars bc it appears to be good quaility just not enough NON bright colors.</li>
            <li> Good product. Beautiful colors and great quality.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is pretty great, but while the pigmentation is fantastic in most of the colors, some of the lighter powders just aren&#x27;t bright at all. The packaging is TERRIBLE. you have to be super super careful when opening and closing the lids to make sure they&#x27;re on tight and the powder doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere but I guess it&#x27;s worth the price. I used it as stage makeup and just some advice, if you&#x27;re going to do what I did you have to select your colors very carefully and experiment with the colors to see which are pigmented enough for theater. Overall though, this set has a nice color variety and for the most part looks great with a bit of primer.</li>
            <li> I like these because there are plenty of colors to choose from, and if the color isnt there the blend well. The only thing i dont like about them is that they dont wash off skin (hands or fingers) well. You really have to scrub, or use eye make-up remover. I will defnitly buy more of these when i run out though.....if I ever run out</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadows very pigmented and bright stays all day with a primer came on time packed well i would recommend these mineral shadows to friends</li>
