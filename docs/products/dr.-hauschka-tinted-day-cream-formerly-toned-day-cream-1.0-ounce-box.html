            <li>I wanted to love this product as I think Dr. Hauschka is an incredible line, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks like you are not wearing anything, yet provides a perfect amount of coverage and evening of tone.</li>
            <li>I first found this brand while traveling in Germany and was so happy to be able to find it here and even order it online.!!!!</li>

            <li>I say more!</li>

            <li>It blends very well and evens out your skin tone wonderfully.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Rose Day Cream.</li>
            <li>Now that I own a bottle</li>
            <li>Very creamy and smooth with just the perfect hint of color for winter pallor.  </li>

            <li>dr. h products are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>But I love this product I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>but when you apply it becomes neutral and leaves the skin with a glow:)</li>
            <li>Love how it feels and it gives my face a moist healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Love every hauschka product I have ever tried</li>
            <li>and I just love this product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Toned day cream is marvelous, comfortable, natural looking and makes me look super healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is the best for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, I have very fair skin; it blended well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a full year now and have never found anything like it!</li>
            <li>Easy transaction, Ive been using this toner for along time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars for the fantastic ingredients and the clean, lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Dr. Hauschka products because they are so light; you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing a day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exchanging it for the Light Day Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>Alone this cream is a lightly tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Try an oil free product.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and healthy.</li>
            <li>Start using it right away!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use Hauschka&#x27;s quince cream and translucent powder, and was hoping that the toned day cream would provide a small amount of coverage with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin  - very cremy and supple.  </li>
            <li>you get from mineral sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes you look vibrant and full of energy!</li>
            <li>I mix it with Rose Day Cream and apply to my face after spritzing with facial toner.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a foundation, it doesn&#x27;t provide &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; per se, it is a tinted moisturizer that evens out skin tone and offers a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting that applying more than a tiny dab will not enhance the glow; it will just make you look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would also like to add that this stuff would be fine if you wanted to build a fireplace in your back yard because you could use this to really make strong bonds between the bricks.....</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I thought that it felt greasy and that I wouldn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I mix this with or layer it on top of my facial cream with mineral SPF.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this day cream when my only option was the samples at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent all day moisturizer, although the color is a little dark for me.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love the healthy glow and evenness it gives for the days that I don&#x27;t want to apply any other make-up.</li>
            <li>No other product can match the healthy glow that the toned day cream provides while making my skin look younger, fresh and radiant while it moisturizes and nourishes.</li>
            <li>It also has a subtle and pleasant fragrance which is a bonus when you are spreading something all over your face.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, it looks dark in the tube</li>
            <li>I really like this and many other Dr. Hauschka products!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for years and love the effect of looking slightly tanned.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This day cream allows the concealer to soak in and set, resulting in a very natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old</li>
            <li>My skin always feeling soft and moist throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Since learning about this gem from a beauty editor friend, I have been wearing it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I recently went to a Arbonne skin care demo and now I&#x27;m questioning my whole skin care routine/needs.</li>
            <li>This is a WOW product.</li>
            <li>It is  just a little too rich for the rest of my face since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do and more or any less of evening out skin tone than any other product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical as  a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I use it with bare minerals and people think I am not wearing makeup.</li>

            <li> but I always come back after the others do not live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the tiny tube can last about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have switched occasionally just to try other products</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry in patches and oily in the summer in patches (dry all over in the winter).</li>
            <li> It gives that delicate under eye area a soft, moist feeling and never makes my skin look dry or crape papery, the way some other product do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products similar to this one to try and save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It provides the moisture other creams do not.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the day oil, which makes it a little sheerer, but it&#x27;s still just a little browner than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> When she uses this day cream and a little blush, she looks about 40.</li>
            <li> The odor of this product is unbearable, and the color is very dark.</li>
            <li> The price is better on Amazon, however I&#x27;ve had 2 now that smell terrible like they&#x27;ve turned sour.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t blend well on your face.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look awful and it was difficult to apply and didn&#x27;t look good on.</li>
            <li> however a few bad batches recieved from Amazon and it looks like I&#x27;ll be purchasing it from the store from now on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does have an unfavorable rating by the Environmental Working Group, meaning that, eventually, I will switch to an unscented day cream.</li>
            <li> I broke out with this cream so bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, the Toned Day Cream is a real disappointment.</li>

            <li> I love this product.. however a few bad batches recieved from Amazon and it looks like I&#x27;ll be purchasing it from the store from now on. The price is better on Amazon, however I&#x27;ve had 2 now that smell terrible like they&#x27;ve turned sour.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Dr. Hauschka products because they are so light; you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing a day moisturizer. However, the Toned Day Cream is a real disappointment. It&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t blend well on your face. I&#x27;m exchanging it for the Light Day Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product as I think Dr. Hauschka is an incredible line, but it did nothing for me. I have fair skin and use Hauschka&#x27;s quince cream and translucent powder, and was hoping that the toned day cream would provide a small amount of coverage with a nice glow. It didn&#x27;t flatter my complexion like some of the happy reviewers below, but! I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars for the fantastic ingredients and the clean, lovely smell.</li>
            <li> The smell leaves a bit to be desired.  I would never wear this alone, only under foundation.  It doesn&#x27;t do and more or any less of evening out skin tone than any other product.  I&#x27;m sticking to Dermologica.  Everyone is different, I have very fair skin; it blended well.  It&#x27;s not sticky.  There&#x27;s just nothing special about it.  I will use it off and on, but overall, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> All of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products are wonderful and the tinted day cream is no exception.  Very creamy and smooth with just the perfect hint of color for winter pallor.  I mix it with Rose Day Cream and apply to my face after spritzing with facial toner.  Really nice!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent all day moisturizer, although the color is a little dark for me. I wish they made it in a lighter color.  I mix it with the day oil, which makes it a little sheerer, but it&#x27;s still just a little browner than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and I have moderate rosacea. My skin is really dry in patches and oily in the summer in patches (dry all over in the winter). I have been using this cream for a full year now and have never found anything like it! It does not cure my rosacea, but it is incredibly moisturizing and soothes my skin. I wear powder foundation over it and together it creates the perfect full coverage. Alone this cream is a lightly tinted moisturizer. I really cannot say enough good things about it. It is like gold to me!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product. It made my skin look awful and it was difficult to apply and didn&#x27;t look good on. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream. It is not loaded with chemicals, gives the face a nice bronzed look and moisturizes as well. I really like this and many other Dr. Hauschka products!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toned day cream, it is the best I have used. It makes my face and look younger. A little goes a long way. Your face will love you for it. It provides the moisture other creams do not.</li>
            <li> great product!  especially if you don&#x27;t want to wear foundation and if you have acne scarred skin.  I have used it for years in place of foundation.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great tinted moisture cream this is it. It blends very well and evens out your skin tone wonderfully. I don&#x27;t like using products with SPF in it on my face because they can make my eyes tear a lot of the time and this product has no SPF in it which works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products similar to this one to try and save a few dollars. The products never compare. I save up my $$$ and go back to Hauschka. If you have oily skin, it&#x27;s not for you. Try an oil free product. It&#x27;s not a foundation, it doesn&#x27;t provide &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; per se, it is a tinted moisturizer that evens out skin tone and offers a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toned Day Cream every day for the last ten years and I can&#x27;t imagine going without it. It goes on smoothly and looks like you are not wearing anything, yet provides a perfect amount of coverage and evening of tone. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer and also has an SPF rating to shield you from harmful rays that will prematurely age your skin. It also has a subtle and pleasant fragrance which is a bonus when you are spreading something all over your face. I use it with bare minerals and people think I am not wearing makeup. (they also think I&#x27;m 8-10 years younger than I am)! This stuff is fantastic! Start using it right away!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and love the effect of looking slightly tanned. It&#x27;s very economical as  a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here purchasing my fourth tube of the Toned Day Cream. You kind of need to give it a chance. When I first applied it, I thought that it felt greasy and that I wouldn&#x27;t like it. Well, I&#x27;m a believer... makes my skin look and feel healthy. I use it daily and love the healthy glow and evenness it gives for the days that I don&#x27;t want to apply any other make-up. Just wish it had sunscreen too, then I would really be perfect!</li>
            <li> Like the tinted cream suppose to be the same ( Tone day cream). Not quite the same.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauchka&#x27;s Suntoned Day Cream is amazing.  I order 2 at a time so I never run out.  It is the best for dry skin!</li>
            <li> dr. h products are simply the best.  been using them for 25 years. nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> I use this under my eyes instead of foundation. It gives that delicate under eye area a soft, moist feeling and never makes my skin look dry or crape papery, the way some other product do. My skin always feeling soft and moist throughout the day. It has a wonderful texture and color. It is  just a little too rich for the rest of my face since I have oily skin. But I love this product I have used it for years. I have switched occasionally just to try other products but I always come back after the others do not live up to their hype. This product is truly excellent.</li>
            <li> The odor of this product is unbearable, and the color is very dark. I&#x27;ll stick with the Rose Day Cream.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it looks dark in the tube but when you apply it becomes neutral and leaves the skin with a glow:)</li>
            <li> gives a youthful glow to any complexion and without harmful chemicals.  I mix my foundation with this and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Since learning about this gem from a beauty editor friend, I have been wearing it nearly every day. Unfortunately, it does have an unfavorable rating by the Environmental Working Group, meaning that, eventually, I will switch to an unscented day cream. In the meantime, this is what I use every day.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way, and the tiny tube can last about 6 months. It&#x27;s worth noting that applying more than a tiny dab will not enhance the glow; it will just make you look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- It does a terrific job of evening out your skin tone without looking like makeup, and it does provide the &#x27;glow&#x27; it promises.&lt;br /&gt;- I use this out of the shower, then I dab on concealer where needed. This day cream allows the concealer to soak in and set, resulting in a very natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;- My mother is nearing 60, with great skin. When she uses this day cream and a little blush, she looks about 40. For this reason, I would recommend this for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> I used to love this day cream when my only option was the samples at Whole Foods. Now that I own a bottle I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working for me. I recently went to a Arbonne skin care demo and now I&#x27;m questioning my whole skin care routine/needs.</li>
            <li> I LOVVVVVE Dr. Hauschka.  Toned day cream is marvelous, comfortable, natural looking and makes me look super healthy.  It works on all ages and I have recommended and given it to friends of all ages and skin types.  This is a WOW product.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin  - very cremy and supple.  I mix this with or layer it on top of my facial cream with mineral SPF.  It helps lessen the whitish hue you get from mineral sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes you look vibrant and full of energy!</li>
            <li> I would also like to add that this stuff would be fine if you wanted to build a fireplace in your back yard because you could use this to really make strong bonds between the bricks..... sort of like cement.</li>
            <li> Perfect for evening out skin tone.  Matches skin tone year around, with or without a tan and evens out any blotches.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels and it gives my face a moist healthy glow. Definitely worth trying. B did d a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and there is nothing like it. It&#x27;s pure and healthy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Terrific- wrapped well</li>
            <li> I first found this brand while traveling in Germany and was so happy to be able to find it here and even order it online.!!!! Best product ever!</li>
            <li> No other product can match the healthy glow that the toned day cream provides while making my skin look younger, fresh and radiant while it moisturizes and nourishes.</li>
            <li> Love every hauschka product I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I broke out with this cream so bad. I got acne at age 58 and it scarred me big time!&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more!</li>
            <li> Easy transaction, Ive been using this toner for along time and I just love this product and easy to use.</li>
