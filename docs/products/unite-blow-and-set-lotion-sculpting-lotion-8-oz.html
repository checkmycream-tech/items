            <li>Great hair product!  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample at one of my hair cut appointments and really liked the way it made my hair behave.</li>
            <li>smells nice.</li>
            <li>It did increase the drying time of my blow out which was nice.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more volume and a nice blow out without the dryness mousse ca sometimes cause.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for light hold and volume!</li>
            <li>It is really hold your hair style, has beautiful smell.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>This is great product, I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It holds my hair well, and much better than a lot of products.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair styling product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product because I like so many Unite products.  </li>
            <li>Liked very much United shampoo and wanted to try the hair spray.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell, almost tropical, but it is very light scent, don&#x27;t really notice it.  </li>
            <li>It is a light lotion to use all over before blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I purchased both and while it takes my unskilled hands much longer to do this to my own hair, these products help with straightening and frizz control.  </li>
            <li>Tried several others but this, by far, has been the best, in keeping my hair under control!</li>
            <li>I have super curly/frizzy hair (3c/3b for you curly speakers).  </li>
            <li>It also seems to be more effective if applied when the hair is still fairly wet.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, drying time is reduced, and my fine hair holds really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>little dab on your palm used with toweled-dried hair is great.</li>
            <li>Next day revitalize it with a smidge more on hair you have just given a light water-misting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot i guess?</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product as it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>This stuff really holds!</li>
            <li>First started using it over 12 years ago where my hairdresser used and sold it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down(my commom complaint) but gives volume and control.</li>
            <li>I also used some of the new wet/dry gel and so far my hair hasnt moved which is rare with my fine strands.</li>
            <li>However, I have very long layered thick straight hair that is balayaged so there are many light pieces on the bottom of the layers that are then hand painted going up a bit beyond the top of the ear.</li>
            <li>I have short fine straight hair, and want to avoid getting perms.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I use this product when I blow dry my hair straight, (not an easy task).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply too much, though, so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the UNITE 7-second spray on (leave in) conditioner for several years - i ordered more via Amazon since my local salon doesn&#x27;t carry it, and saw this product as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>She mixed these two products and my hair was soft, straight and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I recently had my hair done at a salon where the stylist used this product (along with the Unite Lazer straight), and did a blowout.  </li>
            <li>great bouncy hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look dirty the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other stuff i tried does what this product does.</li>
            <li>My hair was actually straight, and fully dry!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and makes my hair look full all day long!</li>

            <li> you can feel it grab on to the round brush while styling.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have used it for years.</li>

            <li> Nice product. It is really hold your hair style, has beautiful smell. I like it, will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really holds! you can feel it grab on to the round brush while styling. and it cut my drying time drastically! I also used some of the new wet/dry gel and so far my hair hasnt moved which is rare with my fine strands.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product. I use this instead of mousse. It gives my hair more volume and a nice blow out without the dryness mousse ca sometimes cause.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I use it everyday and have used it for years. First started using it over 12 years ago where my hairdresser used and sold it. I was hooked. I hope you continue to offer it. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosanne</li>
            <li> This is great product, I have very curly hair and I use this product when I blow dry my hair straight, (not an easy task). It holds my hair well, and much better than a lot of products. I couldn&#x27;t be without this now!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample at one of my hair cut appointments and really liked the way it made my hair behave. No other stuff i tried does what this product does.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent or the consistency.  Tried to exchange for another Unite product but was told I couldn&#x27;t.  Liked very much United shampoo and wanted to try the hair spray.</li>
            <li> My daughter in California has this, and when I went to see her, I tried it out. great bouncy hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look dirty the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little dab on your palm used with toweled-dried hair is great. Next day revitalize it with a smidge more on hair you have just given a light water-misting.</li>
            <li> Works fine. smells nice. Not sure what all to say. Don&#x27;t love it, don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s worth a shot i guess?</li>
            <li> Works great.  It is a light lotion to use all over before blow drying.  I have short fine straight hair, and want to avoid getting perms.  I used this on a humid day, and i kept some poof all day!  I do need to use some finishing hairspray.  This does not leave hair sticky or gummy.  Does not leave residue on my curling iron after.  It has an interesting smell, almost tropical, but it is very light scent, don&#x27;t really notice it.  It is pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Unite Expanda product with this.</li>
            <li> I have super curly/frizzy hair (3c/3b for you curly speakers).  And straightening my hair can be a pain.  I recently had my hair done at a salon where the stylist used this product (along with the Unite Lazer straight), and did a blowout.  My hair was actually straight, and fully dry!  She mixed these two products and my hair was soft, straight and manageable.  I purchased both and while it takes my unskilled hands much longer to do this to my own hair, these products help with straightening and frizz control.  Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> It did increase the drying time of my blow out which was nice. However, I have very long layered thick straight hair that is balayaged so there are many light pieces on the bottom of the layers that are then hand painted going up a bit beyond the top of the ear. I did not like the texture after using this and didn&#x27;t like the way the hair stuck together and seemed dry. It didn&#x27;t help with holding a beachy wave nearly as well as other products I&#x27;ve used. Not a fan of this products.</li>
            <li> Great hair product!  Tried several others but this, by far, has been the best, in keeping my hair under control!</li>
            <li> This lotion gives my hair body and height without having to tease it. I use it after the 5 minute conditioner</li>
            <li> Amazing product for light hold and volume! I mix it with Brazilian Blowout Acai Protective Thermal Straightening Balm to tackle frizz and fight flatness. If only it had better ingredients &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the UNITE 7-second spray on (leave in) conditioner for several years - i ordered more via Amazon since my local salon doesn&#x27;t carry it, and saw this product as well.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, since I&#x27;ve been having issues with thinning hair that I couldn&#x27;t style easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did the trick!  As others have noted, drying time is reduced, and my fine hair holds really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply too much, though, so you have to be careful.  It also seems to be more effective if applied when the hair is still fairly wet.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down(my commom complaint) but gives volume and control. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It isn&#x27;t heavy and makes my hair look full all day long!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair styling product.  I have chin length layered hair. A bottle lasts about 5 or 6 months styling it 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because I like so many Unite products.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with drying time.  Also it is real sticky hard to remove from your hands when used.</li>
