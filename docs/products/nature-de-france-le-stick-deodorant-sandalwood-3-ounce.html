    <ol>
            <li>Great deodorant but need to eliminate Propylene from formula!</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>But the sandal wood is awesome.</li>
            <li>But all in all it smells great</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing its job as a deodorant, and has not resulted in any irritation as I have experienced with some others I have used.</li>
            <li>Sandlewood is good</li>
            <li>It is good if you like sandal wood, which I do.</li>
            <li>When i first opened and applied i was very impressed in both the application and the oder.</li>
            <li>--however it is a very effective product at a reasonable price and most people would be very happy with this---</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paired it with Ogallala Bay Rum &amp; Sandalwood, Encre Noir, Egoiste, Santal Noble and 7 Billion Hearts with pleasing results)</li>
            <li>My husband even uses it every day :-))</li>
            <li>Very mild smell</li>
            <li>Very mild odor protection -</li>
            <li>While this deoderant works just fine, I am dissatisfied with the sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>I brought this product for the promise of being Aluminum free, and it being sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Great Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;-long lasting</li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>At least as good as anything else I&#x27;ve used, honestly.</li>
            <li>; My new favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more subtle scent and is actually effective as a deodorant!</li>
            <li>I honestly had low hopes when it came.</li>
            <li>Le Stick Natural deodorant is about the only deodorant that I will use, and the Sandalwood scent is really great</li>
            <li>The begin with, the deodorant on first inspection had a nice, simple scent.</li>
            <li>I wish the scent would last a little longer, but it is sufficient and it is the best sandalwood deodorant I have found for the price.</li>
            <li>Its extremely rare for me to have a reaction to most any chemicals, so I worry this may be a much larger problem for others.</li>
            <li>I discontinued use and waited about 4-5 days for the rash to disappear then gave it a second try just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone planning to use this deodorant try to find a travel size first and test it out on your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I began to explore sandalwood scents, and was underwhelmed at first by its scent.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff because it smells great and goes on thick</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the package, I could tell the deodorant had very robust scent, which I&#x27;m all in favor of and was exactly what I was aiming for.</li>
            <li>It smells and works only decently, nothing more.</li>
            <li>This one just ended up not being strong enough.</li>
            <li>The stick did have a large air pocket in it, therefore 2 stars for quality.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I undeerstand that not all sandlewood scents are the same and it is not unplesant.  </li>
            <li>As a guy, I felt that Powder Fresh smelled too feminine for me, so Unscented was my only real choice until now.</li>
            <li>This had some good reviews on other websites about being natural and keeping people dry.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to the mineral salts roll on deodorant that I normally use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it reminds me of that old Irish Spring bar soap commercial, &amp;#34;Manly</li>
            <li>Thankfully i was looking for new sandalwood shaving soap, and i found this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Le Stick deodorants for a few years now, and this is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>However, this only worked for about the first 4 hours then the stink set in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate the subtlety of the scent (which can work with most any other personal scents you use.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant, doesn&#x27;t burn and doesn&#x27;t fail me even at the gym.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with this product based on the positive feedback left by Drew.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this deodorant based on several positive reviews here on Amazon, and was really trying to get something that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>I must have tried nearly every brand</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I like the sandalwood shaving soap I ordered from Taylor of Old Bond Street, [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]]</li>
            <li>The scent is much more subtle than the TOBS shaving soap, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>No aluminum or bad chemicals, and great unisex scents.  </li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced compared to other options.</li>
            <li>It smells more of baking soda and clay, and the sandalwood is very very subtle.</li>
            <li>This one cost half as much and works twice as well.  </li>

            <li> However, after applying the deodorant, the aroma simply does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> But the scent doesn&#x27;t last long and the packaging itself is substandard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very heavy sweater but since switching brands, I can smell a slight hint of body odor.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasing sandalwood scent (which is hard to find at a reasonable price).  </li>
            <li> The deodorant was old and dried out.</li>
            <li> After a long 8 hour work day at the farm the oder remained.</li>
            <li> At the end of a long day, you will begin to smell like yourself.</li>
            <li> This deodorant offers just what you need to get through your workday and a few hours of play time after.</li>
            <li> will be trying other deodorants in the future.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single rash occur since discontinued use either.</li>
            <li> It was just a loose stick of clay, and the plastic sides chaffed the armpit.</li>
            <li> Since the high school gym days i have been desperately looking for a decent deodorant/antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Unscented just smells a bit like green French clay.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for heavy sweaters, but as an average guy, this stuff got me to the office and back (30 minutes each way) in 90</li>
            <li> This couldn&#x27;t have been due to anything other than the change in deodorant.</li>
            <li> Powder Fresh is sickening because of the intense smell.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months - it is made from ingredients that do not give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> and if you are not exercising heavily it lasts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent only held up for about 2-3 hours, and did nothing in the way of stopping perspiration.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t stink with the mineral salts</li>
            <li> so hard to find yet there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this again, even though vendors seem to have changed lately.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and woodsy; not over-powering at all.</li>
            <li> But after using it for a couple months, my former deodorants smell very artificial and cloying in comparison.</li>
            <li> Either they gave unpleasant or unlivable smells, they were ineffective,  or i had an negative skin reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> $8 is quite expensive also.</li>
            <li> Worst of all was after only a day or so of usage</li>
            <li> They all make me smell like a plant and fail under the slightest heat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is no &amp;#34;48-hour&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I discovered a very disturbing rash forming on each of my armpits.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Le Stick deodorants for a few years now, and this is by far my favorite scent. As a guy, I felt that Powder Fresh smelled too feminine for me, so Unscented was my only real choice until now. The scent is subtle and woodsy; not over-powering at all. And after two summers in Atlanta in a car with no A/C, I know the stuff works. I can&#x27;t speak for heavy sweaters, but as an average guy, this stuff got me to the office and back (30 minutes each way) in 90+ degrees without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li> The deodorant was old and dried out.</li>
            <li> At least as good as anything else I&#x27;ve used, honestly.</li>
            <li> While this deoderant works just fine, I am dissatisfied with the sandalwood scent. It smells more of baking soda and clay, and the sandalwood is very very subtle.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this product based on the positive feedback left by Drew. Upon receiving the package, I could tell the deodorant had very robust scent, which I&#x27;m all in favor of and was exactly what I was aiming for. However, after applying the deodorant, the aroma simply does not last long at all. I&#x27;m not a very heavy sweater but since switching brands, I can smell a slight hint of body odor. I have no intentions on buying anything Nature De France-related again. $8 is quite expensive also.</li>
            <li> Since the high school gym days i have been desperately looking for a decent deodorant/antiperspirant.  I must have tried nearly every brand but none were to my liking. Either they gave unpleasant or unlivable smells, they were ineffective,  or i had an negative skin reaction to it.  Thankfully i was looking for new sandalwood shaving soap, and i found this product.  I brought this product for the promise of being Aluminum free, and it being sandalwood. I honestly had low hopes when it came. When i first opened and applied i was very impressed in both the application and the oder. After a long 8 hour work day at the farm the oder remained. Great Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;-long lasting&lt;br /&gt;-great smell&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-easy app&lt;br /&gt;-free of Aluminum</li>
            <li> This product is not for me--I like a samdlewood blast and this doesn&#x27;t blast--however it is a very effective product at a reasonable price and most people would be very happy with this---that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it five stars</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It has a pleasing sandalwood scent (which is hard to find at a reasonable price).  I also like this product because it is a deodorant only - it is not an antiperspirant.  I cannot use antiperspirants because they give me a rash.  I have been using this product for a few months - it is made from ingredients that do not give me a rash.  I wish the scent would last a little longer, but it is sufficient and it is the best sandalwood deodorant I have found for the price.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant but need to eliminate Propylene from formula!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff because it smells great and goes on thick but it gave me a bitchen rash that makes my pits hurt...</li>
            <li> Not bad, I undeerstand that not all sandlewood scents are the same and it is not unplesant.  The stick did have a large air pocket in it, therefore 2 stars for quality.</li>
            <li> I walk five miles every day. So i have to admit that when I am finished walking I have to refresh myself. But all in all it smells great and if you are not exercising heavily it lasts.</li>
            <li> Very mild smell, I&#x27;ve never received a comment on it so I don&#x27;t think it registers with anyone except me. Very mild odor protection - I start to stink and have to re-apply at the end of the day when all I&#x27;ve been doing is sitting at the office. It smells and works only decently, nothing more.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this deodorant based on several positive reviews here on Amazon, and was really trying to get something that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum. The begin with, the deodorant on first inspection had a nice, simple scent. Unfortunately, the scent only held up for about 2-3 hours, and did nothing in the way of stopping perspiration. Worst of all was after only a day or so of usage I discovered a very disturbing rash forming on each of my armpits. This couldn&#x27;t have been due to anything other than the change in deodorant. I discontinued use and waited about 4-5 days for the rash to disappear then gave it a second try just to be sure. The rash immediately appeared about a day later and took another 2-3 days to disappear after I discontinued usage once again. I haven&#x27;t had a single rash occur since discontinued use either. I recommend anyone planning to use this deodorant try to find a travel size first and test it out on your skin. Its extremely rare for me to have a reaction to most any chemicals, so I worry this may be a much larger problem for others. Use with caution!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the mineral salts roll on deodorant that I normally use. This had some good reviews on other websites about being natural and keeping people dry. However, this only worked for about the first 4 hours then the stink set in. I usually don&#x27;t stink with the mineral salts but I just sweat a lot. With this I sweat a lot and stink. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 other natural deodorants and none of them worked.  I&#x27;ve tried sprays and crystals. They all make me smell like a plant and fail under the slightest heat. This stuff is great. It smells pleasant, doesn&#x27;t burn and doesn&#x27;t fail me even at the gym.  I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying other deodorants in the future. This one just ended up not being strong enough.</li>
            <li> great product! so hard to find yet there it was on Amazon. Light scent. Does not overpower and smells just like sandal wood. Will definitely re-order. Wish it was offered in lemon or coconut or peach. But the sandal wood is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought two sandalwod scented deodorants from Amazon some weeks back.  This one cost half as much and works twice as well.  It&#x27;s a more subtle scent and is actually effective as a deodorant!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I began to explore sandalwood scents, and was underwhelmed at first by its scent. But after using it for a couple months, my former deodorants smell very artificial and cloying in comparison. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is no &amp;#34;48-hour&amp;#34; deodorant. At the end of a long day, you will begin to smell like yourself. This deodorant offers just what you need to get through your workday and a few hours of play time after. I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate the subtlety of the scent (which can work with most any other personal scents you use. I&#x27;ve paired it with Ogallala Bay Rum &amp; Sandalwood, Encre Noir, Egoiste, Santal Noble and 7 Billion Hearts with pleasing results) I&#x27;ll be buying this again, even though vendors seem to have changed lately.</li>
            <li> No aluminum or bad chemicals, and great unisex scents.  Sandlewood is good and so is Gardenia.  Powder Fresh is sickening because of the intense smell.  Unscented just smells a bit like green French clay.  My husband even uses it every day :-))</li>
            <li> It is good if you like sandal wood, which I do. But the scent doesn&#x27;t last long and the packaging itself is substandard. It was just a loose stick of clay, and the plastic sides chaffed the armpit.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it reminds me of that old Irish Spring bar soap commercial, &amp;#34;Manly yes, but I like it too.&amp;#34; My new favorite deodorant.  Works well at keeping away the smell.</li>
            <li> Le Stick Natural deodorant is about the only deodorant that I will use, and the Sandalwood scent is really great</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I like the sandalwood shaving soap I ordered from Taylor of Old Bond Street, [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]] and it was reasonably priced compared to other options. It seems to be doing its job as a deodorant, and has not resulted in any irritation as I have experienced with some others I have used. The scent is much more subtle than the TOBS shaving soap, which I appreciate. The scent of the shaving soap abates soon after the shave has been completed, and the deodorant is not so overpoweringly scented that it announces your arrival before you enter the room.</li>
