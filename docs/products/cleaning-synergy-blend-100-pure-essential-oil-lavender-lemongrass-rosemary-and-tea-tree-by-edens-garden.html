            <li>It lingers, and leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I make my own cleaning products so not to put toxins into the air.</li>
            <li>The directions for the cleaner are on the side of the bottle which is nice.  </li>

            <li>and it is completely  safe for them to be around while the floor is drying.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than any cleaning product i have bought before.</li>
            <li>OR i had to use MANY drops of scent to achieve the intensity I wanted in my misters.  </li>
            <li>Works awesome on multiple surfaces!</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>I followed the recipe that was listed by the seller, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  not too sure if its working.</li>
            <li>I think I need to do more research for what I can use it on.</li>
            <li>is to be used in a DIY cleaning solution, but I gave it a shot and I. LOVE.</li>
            <li>mopping more</li>
            <li>I will be getting more as I need more.</li>
            <li>I have been really impressed with this cleaning blend - would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>and it smelled better; however, as a stand alone, it smells like medicine, which I&#x27;m sure most people don&#x27;t want their homes/rooms to smell this way.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely scent that I use in my home cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this blend yet for all the possible uses but it has been wonderful to have in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my house smell.  </li>
            <li>I have priced essential oils in stores around my home and believe me this price is excellent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>OMG, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love these oils.</li>
            <li>I really do love this oil for cleaning around the kitchen, bathroom, and floor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad she likes it.</li>
            <li>the most i think.  </li>
            <li>This top quality oil will refresh your home.</li>
            <li>love the smell......</li>
            <li>Love this blend.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li>Love Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>but hey, \\&quot;clean home synergy blend\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t be more fitting!</li>
            <li>The directions are right on the bottle and the solution ends up smelling REALLLLLLLY good, and cleans VERY well to boot!!!!  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>but I love the combined oils and the strong fragrance it gives.</li>
            <li>It can be used easily with most diffusers.</li>
            <li>I find myself  wanting to (versus having to) clean!</li>
            <li>Not only did it clean beautifully, but it made my apartment smell amazing.</li>
            <li>( it is very important to me to keep this glass door shine &amp; clean</li>
            <li>Do they all smell so strong?</li>
            <li>The aroma is strong and should be diluted, which the company recommends anyway.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other popular brands.</li>
            <li>This was my first essential oil and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>I actually ENJOY  </li>
            <li>Has a great smell, came on time and only had a problem with the dropper lid.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, and use it for a fresh smell throughout my home.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Makes my whole house smell clean and amazing.</li>
            <li>I normally like to mix my own scents, but this premix, WOW, it comes across clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>I use this for household cleaning, mixed it with vinegar and water per the instructions and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I clean my floors and my counters.</li>
            <li>I use it with baking soda to clean matresses.</li>
            <li>I also diffuse and have used to clean floors.  </li>
            <li>but my apartment always smells clean.</li>
            <li>This blend has a very clean and crisp smell.  </li>
            <li>solution is great for appliances, counter tops,  sinks, faucets, tubs,</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>I have been cleaning my house with a vinegar solution for a while, the addition of these oils really makes a difference and makes everything smell lovely.  </li>
            <li>I use it in a diffuser and it quickly makes the home smell clean.</li>
            <li>The first time I did this, even the vinegar was strong on my nose, almost as strong smelling as some of those very strong smelling commercial brands.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the house smelling clean and fresh, but not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Smells sooooo fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Love love Edens Garden&#x27;s essential oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT IS nice smell for  cleaning, I feel that the nice smell doesn&#x27;t last long - 3-4 hours max.&lt;br /&gt;overly , nice product; however, I&#x27;ll still keep my windex for the sliding glass door; This mix does clean good; doesn&#x27;t leave water droplets when dried; however, I found that windex ( even diluted with water) cleans faster the glass sliding door,</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>I smell lemon more than most of the other oils blended in and it&#x27;s just fine by me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to make this cleaning solution for spray and swiffer type mops and it smells like natural clean not chemically clean.</li>
            <li>Most bathrooms smell and this is such a strong and prudent scent and it will wipe out those pesky odors.</li>
            <li>This blend was appreciatively helpful, especially since the seller offered a cleaning recipe with vinegar along with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s GUILTFREE and SAFE because you&#x27;re using NATURAL ingredients that we put in our foods</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so MUCH worth</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I use this in my apartment mixed with water as a spray around my apartment in warm months.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t praise these oils enough, its been an incredible and dramatic change for the better :)</li>
            <li>Shipping for this item was super fast!</li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong, but after diluted with water  much better !</li>
            <li>No need to add too much to anything!</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil!</li>
            <li>I use it in my homemade cleaning products and it is a very uplifting smell!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>nothing like I expected but does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>I would buy a much larger bottle if available, I use it daily, and love the scent.</li>
            <li>I figured this would just smell like a certain candle conglomerate&#x27;s &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; scent, but not quite.  </li>
            <li>The oils from Edens Garden are so amazing and work so well, the only thing i wish is that i had started this earlier.</li>
            <li>Therefore, making it much safer to use.</li>
            <li>I dont think I will really be cleaning with it.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>The SMELL IS SOOO MUCH</li>
            <li>Smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It worked very well on my mirrors and windows.</li>
            <li>which I didn&#x27;t really enjoy).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is a real plus when using it in cleaning products.</li>
            <li>With this product, cleaning is a rewarding experience because of the scent and it lasts and you know you mixed it yourself and is natural.</li>
            <li>This Clean Home Blend along with the seller&#x27;s cleaning recipe and a little naturally fragrant liquid soap made cleaning chores much more pleasurable.</li>
            <li>Also, I have a water-based vacuum cleaner and put a few drops in the water basin, which made my house smell very nice.</li>
            <li>It is nice and clean smelling, but a little goes a LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li>cleans windows like a dream mixed as instructed .... also good for regular cleaning also .....  keep several in reserve</li>
            <li>I added drops to cotton balls to put into a smelly (and fairly new) sweeper bag which seems to be doing the trick!  </li>
            <li>AND Super essential oil manufacturer!</li>
            <li>The main smell was the vinegar (</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this particular oil (the cleaning one).  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li>Makes me breath in deep and smile.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying a few more scents when I can</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my Airmate and it makes my house smell so clean!</li>
            <li>Having these particular oils already mixed made creating homemade cleaners that much easier.</li>
            <li>When I wipe down counters etc with it my husband comments on the clean smell.</li>
            <li>ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE OK WHAT I DO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v always heard that vinegar is a natural cleaning aid but the odor of vinegar can be displeasing.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I was using a natural cleaning substance with a displeasing odor like vinegar and this blend resolved my cleaning chores.</li>
            <li>I use this essential oil in spray bottle and desinfect my whole house.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted a natural solution for cleaning at home.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance last and really refreshes the air.</li>
            <li>I have a 6 month old son who gets into everything</li>
            <li>I put a drop in the top of waste baskets around the house and work, and on a tissue in closets, and vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for 4 stars is - I expected to throw away windex, right after trying this solution, and it seems like I have to use on  occasion this windex</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a firm believer that a home isn&#x27;t clean if it doesn&#x27;t smell clean!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please check your own water-based vacuum cleaning system for cautions about the possible negative effects on the plastic it&#x27;s made from.</li>
            <li>do need to use a little more elbow grease in some places than I do with the chemical brands, (but not much)</li>
            <li>It is quite strong so you only need to use a small amount at any time.</li>
            <li>My order came much faster that expected.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturers of systems like that usually advise against using any products other than their own, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems using other brands of aromatic oils in my basin.</li>

            <li> It lingers, and leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I make my own cleaning products so not to put toxins into the air.</li>
            <li> The directions for the cleaner are on the side of the bottle which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice scent, but she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I now make my own laundry detergent and clothes softener, dryer sheets, shampoo, body wash, lotion, scrubs, toothpaste, baby powder, and cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> I used this to clean my windows too as vinegar and water work well by themselves but the added smell is great..</li>
            <li> High quality, excellent price.  </li>
            <li> nice change of pace from most chemical cleaners that&#x27;s for sure!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok not to impressed with the scent used in laundry for a fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Great for spaying in your house or in a burner, refresh those weir stuffy place after a long winter, just great</li>
            <li> and it is completely  safe for them to be around while the floor is drying.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than any cleaning product i have bought before.</li>
            <li> OR i had to use MANY drops of scent to achieve the intensity I wanted in my misters.  </li>
            <li> Works awesome on multiple surfaces!</li>
            <li> Love the smell...</li>
            <li> I followed the recipe that was listed by the seller, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not too sure if its working.</li>
            <li> I think I need to do more research for what I can use it on.</li>
            <li> is to be used in a DIY cleaning solution, but I gave it a shot and I. LOVE.</li>
            <li> mopping more</li>
            <li> I will be getting more as I need more.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this cleaning blend - would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> and it smelled better; however, as a stand alone, it smells like medicine, which I&#x27;m sure most people don&#x27;t want their homes/rooms to smell this way.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scent that I use in my home cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this blend yet for all the possible uses but it has been wonderful to have in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my house smell.  </li>
            <li> I have priced essential oils in stores around my home and believe me this price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> OMG, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love these oils.</li>
            <li> I really do love this oil for cleaning around the kitchen, bathroom, and floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad she likes it.</li>
            <li> the most i think.  </li>
            <li> This top quality oil will refresh your home.</li>
            <li> love the smell......</li>
            <li> Love this blend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> but hey, \\&quot;clean home synergy blend\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t be more fitting!</li>
            <li> The directions are right on the bottle and the solution ends up smelling REALLLLLLLY good, and cleans VERY well to boot!!!!  </li>
            <li> Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> but I love the combined oils and the strong fragrance it gives.</li>
            <li> It can be used easily with most diffusers.</li>
            <li> I find myself  wanting to (versus having to) clean!</li>
            <li> Not only did it clean beautifully, but it made my apartment smell amazing.</li>
            <li> ( it is very important to me to keep this glass door shine &amp; clean</li>
            <li> Do they all smell so strong?</li>
            <li> The aroma is strong and should be diluted, which the company recommends anyway.</li>
            <li> We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to other popular brands.</li>
            <li> This was my first essential oil and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> I actually ENJOY  </li>
            <li> Has a great smell, came on time and only had a problem with the dropper lid.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil, and use it for a fresh smell throughout my home.</li>
            <li> I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li> Makes my whole house smell clean and amazing.</li>
            <li> I normally like to mix my own scents, but this premix, WOW, it comes across clean and bright.  </li>
            <li> I use this for household cleaning, mixed it with vinegar and water per the instructions and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I clean my floors and my counters.</li>
            <li> I use it with baking soda to clean matresses.</li>
            <li> I also diffuse and have used to clean floors.  </li>
            <li> but my apartment always smells clean.</li>
            <li> This blend has a very clean and crisp smell.  </li>
            <li> solution is great for appliances, counter tops,  sinks, faucets, tubs,</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been cleaning my house with a vinegar solution for a while, the addition of these oils really makes a difference and makes everything smell lovely.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a diffuser and it quickly makes the home smell clean.</li>
            <li> The first time I did this, even the vinegar was strong on my nose, almost as strong smelling as some of those very strong smelling commercial brands.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the house smelling clean and fresh, but not perfumed.  </li>
            <li> Smells sooooo fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Love love Edens Garden&#x27;s essential oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS nice smell for  cleaning, I feel that the nice smell doesn&#x27;t last long - 3-4 hours max.&lt;br /&gt;overly , nice product; however, I&#x27;ll still keep my windex for the sliding glass door; This mix does clean good; doesn&#x27;t leave water droplets when dried; however, I found that windex ( even diluted with water) cleans faster the glass sliding door,</li>
            <li> That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I smell lemon more than most of the other oils blended in and it&#x27;s just fine by me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to make this cleaning solution for spray and swiffer type mops and it smells like natural clean not chemically clean.</li>
            <li> Most bathrooms smell and this is such a strong and prudent scent and it will wipe out those pesky odors.</li>
            <li> This blend was appreciatively helpful, especially since the seller offered a cleaning recipe with vinegar along with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s GUILTFREE and SAFE because you&#x27;re using NATURAL ingredients that we put in our foods</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so MUCH worth</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I use this in my apartment mixed with water as a spray around my apartment in warm months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise these oils enough, its been an incredible and dramatic change for the better :)</li>
            <li> Shipping for this item was super fast!</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong, but after diluted with water  much better !</li>
            <li> No need to add too much to anything!</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil!</li>
            <li> I use it in my homemade cleaning products and it is a very uplifting smell!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> nothing like I expected but does smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> I would buy a much larger bottle if available, I use it daily, and love the scent.</li>
            <li> I figured this would just smell like a certain candle conglomerate&#x27;s &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; scent, but not quite.  </li>
            <li> The oils from Edens Garden are so amazing and work so well, the only thing i wish is that i had started this earlier.</li>
            <li> Therefore, making it much safer to use.</li>
            <li> I dont think I will really be cleaning with it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> The SMELL IS SOOO MUCH</li>
            <li> Smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my mirrors and windows.</li>
            <li> which I didn&#x27;t really enjoy).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is a real plus when using it in cleaning products.</li>
            <li> With this product, cleaning is a rewarding experience because of the scent and it lasts and you know you mixed it yourself and is natural.</li>
            <li> This Clean Home Blend along with the seller&#x27;s cleaning recipe and a little naturally fragrant liquid soap made cleaning chores much more pleasurable.</li>
            <li> Also, I have a water-based vacuum cleaner and put a few drops in the water basin, which made my house smell very nice.</li>
            <li> It is nice and clean smelling, but a little goes a LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li> cleans windows like a dream mixed as instructed .... also good for regular cleaning also .....  keep several in reserve</li>
            <li> I added drops to cotton balls to put into a smelly (and fairly new) sweeper bag which seems to be doing the trick!  </li>
            <li> AND Super essential oil manufacturer!</li>
            <li> The main smell was the vinegar (</li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this particular oil (the cleaning one).  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li> Makes me breath in deep and smile.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying a few more scents when I can</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my Airmate and it makes my house smell so clean!</li>
            <li> Having these particular oils already mixed made creating homemade cleaners that much easier.</li>
            <li> When I wipe down counters etc with it my husband comments on the clean smell.</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE OK WHAT I DO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v always heard that vinegar is a natural cleaning aid but the odor of vinegar can be displeasing.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I was using a natural cleaning substance with a displeasing odor like vinegar and this blend resolved my cleaning chores.</li>
            <li> I use this essential oil in spray bottle and desinfect my whole house.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted a natural solution for cleaning at home.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance last and really refreshes the air.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 month old son who gets into everything</li>
            <li> I put a drop in the top of waste baskets around the house and work, and on a tissue in closets, and vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 4 stars is - I expected to throw away windex, right after trying this solution, and it seems like I have to use on  occasion this windex</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that a home isn&#x27;t clean if it doesn&#x27;t smell clean!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please check your own water-based vacuum cleaning system for cautions about the possible negative effects on the plastic it&#x27;s made from.</li>
            <li> do need to use a little more elbow grease in some places than I do with the chemical brands, (but not much)</li>
            <li> It is quite strong so you only need to use a small amount at any time.</li>
            <li> My order came much faster that expected.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturers of systems like that usually advise against using any products other than their own, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems using other brands of aromatic oils in my basin.</li>
            <li> I use as a room spray, in vacuum cleaner, in baking soda scrub, etc.</li>
            <li> I am using it all over my home, in the cleaner that it suggests, on a cotton ball in my vacuum, in my trash cans</li>
            <li> (*IF you use a cup of peppermint tea mixed in, ((Loose or from tea bags..not instant)), it works ALSO as an ANTIBIOTIC!*)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chose five stars, because I really cannot find anything negative to say about this blend of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I might use it here and there but not on a regular basis like my other essential oils.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I had tried other essential oils before finding Garden of Eden oils.  </li>
            <li> I have two dogs and prior to using this product it seemed the other products just masked the smell</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this item and/or other blends made by this brand.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil for cleaning with white distilled vinegar on a sponge and wipe down my surfaces.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the little droplet cap leaks around the sides.</li>
            <li> It smelled old ladyish, my kids had a hard time with it, as did my husband.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Rosemary from other MFGs had a scent of sage</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other reviewer posted :  10-15 drops of this product + 20 oz of purified H20 + 2-3 tbs of vinegar, and</li>
            <li> We had such a hard time making a decision on what one we wanted</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell, I&#x27;m sorry to me</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others and I cannot wait to get other Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
            <li> I am sick (sometimes literally) of inhaling the various chemicals in the air that exist in our modern world.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a little booklet with all of their products and what the difference oils can be used for.  </li>
            <li> I switched from harsh chemicals to the vinegar based mopping.  </li>
            <li> I just finished cleaning our basement and sprayed this around after the floors dried</li>
            <li> I usually use vinegar but this blend allows for cleaning everything without streaks and spots.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to get my amber bottles</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> No way will it let you count the drops, it runs down the side of the bottle, sloppy.  </li>
            <li> I have been disappointed in other manufacturer&#x27;s of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> so I feel better knowing my house is disinfected without leaving nasty chemical residues behind</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed with these oils ( I&#x27;ve bought at least 30 different oils since i started) and because they work</li>
            <li> took away the \\&quot;boy\\&quot; smell in the bathroom if you know what i mean!  </li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> it was not a great smell.</li>
            <li> NO MORE HEADACHES from horrible fumes and vinegar smells!...</li>
            <li> Absolutely obsessed with this oil!</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;ve decided to get rid of all the bad chemicals in my house and switch it to homemade stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate them, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; me like it does my wife.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of Pledge, but without the nasty chemicals.</li>

            <li> I can not be happier with this product! My house still smells good after two hours of cleaning my floor. I have two pets and it is completely  safe for them to be around while the floor is drying. I will be buying this product  many times for me and for gifts!</li>
            <li> I like this essential oil blend.  It is nice and clean smelling, but a little goes a LONG WAY!  No need to add too much to anything!</li>
            <li> This blend was appreciatively helpful, especially since the seller offered a cleaning recipe with vinegar along with it. I&#x27;v always heard that vinegar is a natural cleaning aid but the odor of vinegar can be displeasing. This Clean Home Blend along with the seller&#x27;s cleaning recipe and a little naturally fragrant liquid soap made cleaning chores much more pleasurable. Knowing that I was using a natural cleaning substance with a displeasing odor like vinegar and this blend resolved my cleaning chores. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! I use it in my homemade vinegar and water household cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Pledge, but without the nasty chemicals. Therefore, making it much safer to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I loved this product !  It met all my expectations....</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it with apple cider vinegear and banking soda! Cleans better than any cleaning product i have bought before.</li>
            <li> I think it kind of stinks.  I dont think I will really be cleaning with it.</li>
            <li> Currently using it in my home made products. I thought it would have a stronger smell but for the price it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had done some research on making homemade cleaners and of course, you need essential oils! We had such a hard time making a decision on what one we wanted but hey, \\&quot;clean home synergy blend\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t be more fitting! It smells incredible and lasts. I&#x27;m a firm believer that a home isn&#x27;t clean if it doesn&#x27;t smell clean!&lt;br /&gt; We&#x27;re very happy with the product and look forward to trying more in future cleaners! :D</li>
            <li> I had tried other essential oils before finding Garden of Eden oils.  I have been disappointed in other manufacturer&#x27;s of essential oils.  Rosemary from other MFGs had a scent of sage OR i had to use MANY drops of scent to achieve the intensity I wanted in my misters.  Then I found Garden of Eden!  Two to three Drops of Cleaning/Clean House in my mister scents the room perfectly!  I normally like to mix my own scents, but this premix, WOW, it comes across clean and bright.  Makes me breath in deep and smile.  Great Scent to choose if you have never picked a premix scent.  AND Super essential oil manufacturer!</li>
            <li> Works awesome on multiple surfaces! I use it on toilets and vanities, counter tops too!</li>
            <li> Love the smell... I clean my floors and my counters. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I just received this today and completely love it! I followed the recipe that was listed by the seller, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Not only did it clean beautifully, but it made my apartment smell amazing. I will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> Really tiny bottle and I&#x27;m  not too fond of the smell. I use it with baking soda to clean matresses. I&#x27;m  not too sure if its working. But its great to have. I think I need to do more research for what I can use it on.</li>
            <li> I figured this would just smell like a certain candle conglomerate&#x27;s &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; scent, but not quite.  i didn&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s purpose is to be used in a DIY cleaning solution, but I gave it a shot and I. LOVE. IT!!!!!!  The directions are right on the bottle and the solution ends up smelling REALLLLLLLY good, and cleans VERY well to boot!!!!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!!  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with everything I&#x27;ve purchased from Eden&#x27;s Garden.  High quality, excellent price.  Their Neroli oil is to DIE FOR!!! If you like Neroli (the scent used in many Decleor products, which I can no longer find, but was jonesing for the scent), you will adore the EG version!!  Highly recommend this particular oil (the cleaning one).  make that solution, put it in a spray bottle and get yo clean on!!</li>
            <li> This blend has a very clean and crisp smell.  I have been sing in a spray bottle to keep germs at bay.  I also diffuse and have used to clean floors.  Will buy again.  Need to order valor synergy blend next!</li>
            <li> I use this for household cleaning, mixed it with vinegar and water per the instructions and the results are amazing! I have two dogs and prior to using this product it seemed the other products just masked the smell and it was a chemical scent. With this product, cleaning is a rewarding experience because of the scent and it lasts and you know you mixed it yourself and is natural. I find myself  wanting to (versus having to) clean!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  My family does not care for how it smells either. I might use it here and there but not on a regular basis like my other essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!...I switched from harsh chemicals to the vinegar based mopping.  The first time I did this, even the vinegar was strong on my nose, almost as strong smelling as some of those very strong smelling commercial brands.  But after mixing THIS ESSENTIAL OIL CLEANER with it...The SMELL IS SOOO MUCH NICER!&lt;br /&gt;  The only change I made is that I added peppermint tea to it as well!  You know when you use it it&#x27;s GUILTFREE and SAFE because you&#x27;re using NATURAL ingredients that we put in our foods, that won&#x27;t harm people or pets... and it is not only a DISINFECTANT, (*IF you use a cup of peppermint tea mixed in, ((Loose or from tea bags..not instant)), it works ALSO as an ANTIBIOTIC!*)&lt;br /&gt;I do need to use a little more elbow grease in some places than I do with the chemical brands, (but not much)...but it&#x27;s so MUCH worth it...NO MORE HEADACHES from horrible fumes and vinegar smells!...I actually ENJOY  mopping more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TY...GB</li>
            <li> A+ Perfect for what I need. I will be getting more as I need more. Smells like the real thing. I Highly recommend this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I have just recently started using essential oils in my all-natural cleaners. I have been really impressed with this cleaning blend - would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I put a drop in the top of waste baskets around the house and work, and on a tissue in closets, and vacuum cleaner.  It lingers, and leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing I love this</li>
            <li> Has a great smell, came on time and only had a problem with the dropper lid.  No way will it let you count the drops, it runs down the side of the bottle, sloppy.  Other than that, the product was great.</li>
            <li> Great scent.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in a Vinegar/water shower spray and it does a great job of masking the vinegar smell. Looking forward to trying a few more scents when I can</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell, I&#x27;m sorry to me it was not a great smell. It smelled old ladyish, my kids had a hard time with it, as did my husband. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again and it may be a while before I buy another EO. Do they all smell so strong?</li>
            <li> I love this oil, and use it for a fresh smell throughout my home. I would buy a much larger bottle if available, I use it daily, and love the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to make this cleaning solution for spray and swiffer type mops and it smells like natural clean not chemically clean.</li>
            <li> Great smell!  Love this product! I highly Recommend.  It leaves the house smelling clean and fresh, but not perfumed.  It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I make my own cleaning products so not to put toxins into the air. I make a shower spray with this and it smells clean/crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for cleaning/refreshing my house.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the more expensive brand. Smells amazing in my kitchen cleaner recipe.</li>
            <li> cleans windows like a dream mixed as instructed .... also good for regular cleaning also .....  keep several in reserve</li>
            <li> I mixed it with vanilla essential oil and it smelled better; however, as a stand alone, it smells like medicine, which I&#x27;m sure most people don&#x27;t want their homes/rooms to smell this way.</li>
            <li> Shipping for this item was super fast! I ordered on a Wednesday afternoon and received my items on Friday. Smells great. Don&#x27;t know how they compare to the big name ones but I&#x27;m happy to have found these oils and happy that I saved money by not ordering the others just because of the name.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scent that I use in my home cleaning products.  A lot of them contain vinegar and this cuts that vinegar smell without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this blend yet for all the possible uses but it has been wonderful to have in the diffuser. It is quite strong so you only need to use a small amount at any time. It smells quite like disinfectant but my apartment always smells clean. I would recommend this product to others and I cannot wait to get other Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase, this oil smells amazing. I use as a room spray, in vacuum cleaner, in baking soda scrub, etc. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My order came much faster that expected.  I love the way it makes my house smell.  I just finished cleaning our basement and sprayed this around after the floors dried and it smells wonderful.  They sent me a little booklet with all of their products and what the difference oils can be used for.  I have priced essential oils in stores around my home and believe me this price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with white vinegar as a fabric softener and household cleaner. Smells fresh. When I wipe down counters etc with it my husband comments on the clean smell. Great price compared to other popular brands.</li>
            <li> Mixed as recommended, 2 cups purified water, 1 cup vinegar, 20 drops oil........OMG, love it.  I usually use vinegar but this blend allows for cleaning everything without streaks and spots.  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love these oils. my only issue is with the wrapper because I can never tell if it&#x27;s almost gone or not. but I love the combined oils and the strong fragrance it gives.</li>
            <li> I use this in my apartment mixed with water as a spray around my apartment in warm months. It smells great and repels bugs. Edges of walls, floors and window ledges.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil! I use it in my homemade cleaning products and it is a very uplifting smell!</li>
            <li> Smell wonderful.  Using it for DIY cleaning solutions like daily shower spray.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE OK WHAT I DO.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very clean.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong, but after diluted with water  much better ! I use this essential oil in spray bottle and desinfect my whole house.  Love love Edens Garden&#x27;s essential oils. Best prices too !!</li>
            <li> smells great and cleans well</li>
            <li> Absolutely obsessed with this oil! I am using it all over my home, in the cleaner that it suggests, on a cotton ball in my vacuum, in my trash cans etc... Am considering using it in the diffuser. Smells sooooo fresh and clean you can help but wanna spend your days cleaning!</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent. Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> nothing like I expected but does smell nice.  I added drops to cotton balls to put into a smelly (and fairly new) sweeper bag which seems to be doing the trick!  Anxious to get my amber bottles so I can dilute and use around the house.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this essential oil. I used it in my diffuser and made a cleaning product with it.  A little goes a long way.  The directions for the cleaner are on the side of the bottle which is nice.  It worked very well on my mirrors and windows.</li>
            <li> I really do love this oil for cleaning around the kitchen, bathroom, and floor. Afterwards, visitors comment on how good my house smells.</li>
            <li> I love making my own cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted a natural solution for cleaning at home.  I am sick (sometimes literally) of inhaling the various chemicals in the air that exist in our modern world.  This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this and uses it almost every week.  Has a nice scent, but she loves it.  So those five stars are from her.  Personally, I&#x27;m not an essential oil fan.  I don&#x27;t hate them, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; me like it does my wife.  I&#x27;m glad she likes it.</li>
            <li> have used this for years. I love it! Smells wonderful and does what it says it will do. Edens Garden is always timely and sells good products.</li>
            <li> I mixed as stated on the bottle : 2 cups of purified H2O + 1 cup of Distilled vinegar + 20 drops this product ----- The main smell was the vinegar ( which I didn&#x27;t really enjoy).&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewer posted :  10-15 drops of this product + 20 oz of purified H20 + 2-3 tbs of vinegar, and Voila ! smell better !&lt;br /&gt;IT IS nice smell for  cleaning, I feel that the nice smell doesn&#x27;t last long - 3-4 hours max.&lt;br /&gt;overly , nice product; however, I&#x27;ll still keep my windex for the sliding glass door; This mix does clean good; doesn&#x27;t leave water droplets when dried; however, I found that windex ( even diluted with water) cleans faster the glass sliding door, ( it is very important to me to keep this glass door shine &amp; clean&lt;br /&gt;This solution is great for appliances, counter tops,  sinks, faucets, tubs, Oh so good on floors, windows. I think I still will use windex for windows, mirrors, glass sliding door.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars is - I expected to throw away windex, right after trying this solution, and it seems like I have to use on  occasion this windex</li>
            <li> This smells so good. Most bathrooms smell and this is such a strong and prudent scent and it will wipe out those pesky odors. I DO Plan to order it again and again. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed on the back with vinegar. SMELLS AND WORKS GREAT. I used this to clean my windows too as vinegar and water work well by themselves but the added smell is great..</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with Edens Garden. We have a ton of their essential oils. Having these particular oils already mixed made creating homemade cleaners that much easier.</li>
            <li> Great for spaying in your house or in a burner, refresh those weir stuffy place after a long winter, just great</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. price was right for a great product.</li>
            <li> i just mixed up my 1st batch of cleaner w/ this &amp; it&#x27;s great!  took away the \\&quot;boy\\&quot; smell in the bathroom if you know what i mean!  ;-)  i&#x27;m picking up the lemongrass the most i think.  it&#x27;s a very refreshing smell....nice change of pace from most chemical cleaners that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the Cleaning blend!  I add a few drops to my Airmate and it makes my house smell so clean!</li>
            <li> This top quality oil will refresh your home. It can be used easily with most diffusers. The fragrance last and really refreshes the air.</li>
            <li> I chose five stars, because I really cannot find anything negative to say about this blend of essential oils. The aroma is strong and should be diluted, which the company recommends anyway. This is a real plus when using it in cleaning products. Also, I have a water-based vacuum cleaner and put a few drops in the water basin, which made my house smell very nice. Please check your own water-based vacuum cleaning system for cautions about the possible negative effects on the plastic it&#x27;s made from. The manufacturers of systems like that usually advise against using any products other than their own, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems using other brands of aromatic oils in my basin. I would definitely purchase this item and/or other blends made by this brand.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product -- cleans and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been cleaning my house with a vinegar solution for a while, the addition of these oils really makes a difference and makes everything smell lovely.  These oils have anti-microbial properties too so I feel better knowing my house is disinfected without leaving nasty chemical residues behind</li>
            <li> love the smell......I have a steam mop so don&#x27;t always use it, but when I use my regular mop this always goes into the water....</li>
            <li> This produces a very nice  and refreshing scent. I use it in a diffuser and it quickly makes the home smell clean. It&#x27;s a pleasant blend without being overpowering. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This was my first essential oil and it smells great!  The only con is that the little droplet cap leaks around the sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for streak-free mirrors, for a ceramic cooktop, and for counters and toilets and it works great for all! I use the recipe on the bottle--2 cups distilled water, 1 cup white vinegar, and 20 drops of the oil blend. It feels great to get the toxic chemicals out of my home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not to impressed with the scent used in laundry for a fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Great item... wonderful scent..... ...... ...... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li> I have a 6 month old son who gets into everything and i kept seeing him getting into the chemicals one day and drinking them. So one day i cleared out my cleaning cabinet and switched it with all homemade cleaning stuff. The oils from Edens Garden are so amazing and work so well, the only thing i wish is that i had started this earlier. I have yet to be disappointed with these oils ( I&#x27;ve bought at least 30 different oils since i started) and because they work so well I&#x27;ve decided to get rid of all the bad chemicals in my house and switch it to homemade stuff. I now make my own laundry detergent and clothes softener, dryer sheets, shampoo, body wash, lotion, scrubs, toothpaste, baby powder, and cleaning supplies. I can&#x27;t praise these oils enough, its been an incredible and dramatic change for the better :)</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance for cleaning!</li>
            <li> Love this blend. I use it on wool dryer balls and even my husband likes the scent on his clothes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell. Makes my whole house smell clean and amazing. Packaging was great. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> may be it&#x27;s good but I&#x27;m not sure how to use it.Just want some suggestion at the bottle, please add it next time.</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden. Affordable and good quality.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil for cleaning with white distilled vinegar on a sponge and wipe down my surfaces. After, I drop some in the sink and the smell lasts forever. I smell lemon more than most of the other oils blended in and it&#x27;s just fine by me. Great product for those of us who don&#x27;t want a chemically bleachy smell after cleaning. use it on floors,toilets and anything else you like.</li>
