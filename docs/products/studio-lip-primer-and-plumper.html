    <ol>
            <li>The plumper does sting your lips but all plumpers do, it smells amazing and works great!</li>
            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>Its very easy to apply and it made my lips lasted for four hours of being out the house!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look good under lipstick.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price</li>
            <li>It changed my lipstick color and the primer broke the minute I pulled off the cap and even though it smelled good, it tingled my lips.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Honestly my lipstick came off faster than me not using these products</li>
            <li>However, having it on under my lipstick in school made it smudge a bit and kind of feathered out a bit.</li>
            <li>The plumper tastes nice.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t plump, but smells nice (cinnamon).</li>
            <li>temporarily kind of looked like an allergic reaction and as i write, boom...skinny lips again....</li>
            <li>Still didnt en-flare my lips but who honestly expects that?</li>
            <li>Verrry high quality, verrrrry good price!!</li>
            <li>It came wrapped securely and in good time.</li>
            <li>Works good sort of cool minty flavor</li>
            <li>it changes the color too much but is great to make your lipgloss or maybe lip tar (haven&#x27;t tried tho)</li>
            <li>but I love the plumper.  </li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon fragrance.</li>
            <li>This lets me blend colors better, which I do all the time.</li>
            <li>The plumper is okay and works well with Some lip glosses but does not work well with lipstick.</li>
            <li>yay many did, was thinking I was having a reaction</li>
            <li>/&gt;the plumper tingled more than venom primer did.</li>
            <li>The primer is pretty good</li>
            <li>but it was cheap :)</li>
            <li>Plumper works by burning your lips with strong cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li>cheap product .</li>
            <li>If you exfoliate your lips beforehand with cinnamon on a toothbrush and apply a generous amount of the lip plumper it will work pretty well :)</li>
            <li>First, the lip primer lightens the shade of the lipstick you put on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing (if you like cinnamon), but it doesn&#x27;t really plump my lips.  </li>
            <li>The primer is OK, but the lip plumper absolutely doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied and I would repurchase.</li>
            <li>I have used way better plumper than this, would much rather pay more money for something that actually serves the purpose than spend close to $6 on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Too often I have bought a color I thought I liked only to find out</li>
            <li>The lip primer fell right out of the tube when I opened it up...</li>
            <li>Bought this from Wal-Mart today and used right away, my plumping end fell off too, I came here to see if anyone else had the burn and</li>
            <li>I licked my lips too much&#x27; chapped, but a unique and torturous kind of chapped that you would think you could only get by applying a strong bathroom cleaner directly to the lips.</li>
            <li>Love this product especially for the price and will be reordering!</li>
            <li>This did worry me at first.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t effect color much if you put it on very lightly, but I also don&#x27;t think the primer actually primes your lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was the slowest of all my many amazon buys to arrive, but not slow enough to be irritated.</li>
            <li>The plumper smells like pure cinnamon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cinnamon-y</li>
            <li>I use both sides of this product and I really like both.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference in the looks or longetivity of lip color.</li>
            <li>Straight into the trash it goes.</li>
            <li>which i am really bummed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was very smooth, didn&#x27;t wipe off,and actually gave my bright color a more natural look which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li>The primer has a very nude thick color almost like its own lipstick.</li>
            <li>[will it ruin the shade of my particular red?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very helpful product for an 80-year- old&#x27;s lips</li>
            <li>Its not thick, waxy, sticky, or oily.</li>
            <li>I can admit that I will use this (only primer) if I want to change up my lip color just for fun</li>
            <li>but I like it because it means you can create new shades.</li>
            <li>but some may say its a little too strong</li>
            <li>The seller carefully wrapped and quickly shipped the item, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and very soft.</li>
            <li>sometimes its hard to apply the primer on without having different shades of colors but does come in handy plump my lips</li>
            <li>The primer is a skin color which completely changes the color of whatever lipstick you put on, making it lighter and a creamier clumpy texture.</li>
            <li>I love how the primer goes on soft and thin.</li>
            <li>The plumper is BASICLY cinnamon lip balm it only works if u have no dead skin on Your lips</li>
            <li>I used a little bit of bright purple lipstick [color divine] over it, but only a little bit as I had heavy eye makeup on.</li>

            <li> However, the primer smells normal and helps keep lipstick on for a just a little longer than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t plump my lips for long.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Was dry.</li>
            <li> I even waites for it to dry or something but nothing.</li>
            <li> Not a normal &#x27;</li>
            <li> The plumper burns pretty bad and doesn&#x27;t really give the &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The Primer is really white, and unless you put it on half an hour before your lipstick, there&#x27;s really no point.</li>
            <li> I find this to keep my lipstick where I want it and the lipstick will last longer than usual, although nothing lasts really long.</li>
            <li> the plump side broke off easily so be careful when you applying</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My main problem was the plumper was completely broken and melted in the cap when i opened it</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m the only one but</li>
            <li> Other than that, I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Primer makes any shade of lipstick you put over it a million shades lighter, the plumper is basically a cinnamon chapstick, doesn&#x27;t plump but instead just makes you uncomfortable by burning and stinging your lips with cinnamon (and the smell is really overpowering).</li>
            <li> The primer goes on thick and white and does not blend in.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it just burns please don&#x27;t waste money and find another product.</li>
            <li> I have yet to put heavy color over it</li>
            <li> I normally love elf products but this is the worst ever.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It was so thick that it was like using lipstick already.</li>
            <li> Does not plump lips or avoid few thin lines.</li>
            <li> The primer was oily and thick on my lips.</li>
            <li> the primer end sucks wipped it off immediately it just dried and caked up even though I just used an exfoliating stick..pretty useless</li>
            <li> LOOKS A LITTLE BIT FAKE.</li>
            <li> This product BURNED my lips really bad, the second I put it on!</li>
            <li> so u gotta exfoliate your lips before and the primer is not good for lipstick</li>
            <li> Not a good buy in my opinion, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The Primer is useless, and feels heavy.</li>
            <li> It burns really bad and dried out my lips.</li>
            <li> Feels weird.</li>
            <li> The primer was a weird color</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I do not find the tingling of the plumping side painful.</li>
            <li> My lip gloss looked horrible with it.</li>
            <li> but the plumper is terrible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the primer, its awful.</li>
            <li> Plumper smells horrible</li>
            <li> Terrible very terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was dry. Did not work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t plump my lips for long. It has a wonderful scent and moisturizes very well. The primer also works well. I have two- one for home and one to carry with me.</li>
            <li> The plumper is BASICLY cinnamon lip balm it only works if u have no dead skin on Your lips so u gotta exfoliate your lips before and the primer is not good for lipstick it changes the color too much but is great to make your lipgloss or maybe lip tar (haven&#x27;t tried tho)</li>
            <li> Primer doesn&#x27;t work. Plumper works by burning your lips with strong cinnamon oil. Not sure if I&#x27;m the only one but after one use my lips were chapped for five days. Not a normal &#x27;I licked my lips too much&#x27; chapped, but a unique and torturous kind of chapped that you would think you could only get by applying a strong bathroom cleaner directly to the lips.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. The lip plumper definitely works for me without being overdone. It&#x27;s very cinnamon-y so if you don&#x27;t want that I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it. The primer itself just lightened up my lipstick. I even waites for it to dry or something but nothing. It doesn&#x27;t effect color much if you put it on very lightly, but I also don&#x27;t think the primer actually primes your lips.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money. It was so thick that it was like using lipstick already. My lip gloss looked horrible with it. Stay away!</li>
            <li> like the product. deff. gives me tingly feeling on my lips but when applying it. the plump side broke off easily so be careful when you applying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. The Primer is really white, and unless you put it on half an hour before your lipstick, there&#x27;s really no point.</li>
            <li> Primer does lighten your lipstick but I like it because it means you can create new shades. The plumper does sting your lips but all plumpers do, it smells amazing and works great! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It burns, like tingles when you put it on. Feels weird. I DONT use the primer because it makes all the colors I wear look muted.</li>
            <li> I use both sides of this product and I really like both. I do not find the tingling of the plumping side painful. I do find that the primer prolongs the life of my lipstick. Overall, very satisfied and I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help keep my lipstick on but it only made my lips look \\&quot;dead\\&quot;.  When I used the gloss end, it was not glossy at all.  Did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> Verrry high quality, verrrrry good price!!</li>
            <li> The primer is pretty good but the plumper is terrible. It burns really bad and dried out my lips. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Seems to work but does not last all day</li>
            <li> Very helpful product for an 80-year- old&#x27;s lips</li>
            <li> This product BURNED my lips really bad, the second I put it on!</li>
            <li> This was totally gross. The plumper was cinnamon and it burned. The primer was a weird color and it didn&#x27;t look good under lipstick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the primer, its awful. If you exfoliate your lips beforehand with cinnamon on a toothbrush and apply a generous amount of the lip plumper it will work pretty well :) only costs 3 bucks at Target or Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I would rather have the primer in a flesh color but I love the plumper.  It came wrapped securely and in good time.</li>
            <li> it sucked! total waste of money. the lip plumper burned when i put it on n it broke off n the lip primer was like cream color n it mixed in with my loreal lipstay n it made it stick n change color. i didnt like it at all</li>
            <li> There was not a lot of product on either side of the plumper/primer. The primer is a skin color which completely changes the color of whatever lipstick you put on, making it lighter and a creamier clumpy texture. The plumper burns pretty bad and doesn&#x27;t really give the &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effect. I have used way better plumper than this, would much rather pay more money for something that actually serves the purpose than spend close to $6 on something that doesn&#x27;t work. Not a good buy in my opinion, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it states. Does not plump lips or avoid few thin lines. It only BURNS LIPS</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again big disappointment. The primer is OK, but the lip plumper absolutely doesn&#x27;t work at all it just burns please don&#x27;t waste money and find another product.</li>
            <li> It altered the color of my lipstick a bit but it kept it on well. Good product, good price</li>
            <li> Keeps my lipstick and lip glosses in tact. Love the cinnamon fragrance.</li>
            <li> Plumper smells horrible I had to remove it entirely so not to smell it at all. However, the primer smells normal and helps keep lipstick on for a just a little longer than nothing at all. Do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> sometimes its hard to apply the primer on without having different shades of colors but does come in handy plump my lips</li>
            <li> Works good sort of cool minty flavor</li>
            <li> LOOKS A LITTLE BIT FAKE.</li>
            <li> Terrible very terrible. The primer was oily and thick on my lips. It changed my lipstick color and the primer broke the minute I pulled off the cap and even though it smelled good, it tingled my lips. Honestly my lipstick came off faster than me not using these products</li>
            <li> This leaves a white residue on the lips and it interfere with the lip stick that your putting on give it a cake up cracked look</li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply and it made my lips lasted for four hours of being out the house! However, having it on under my lipstick in school made it smudge a bit and kind of feathered out a bit. So I&#x27;ll say the product can last up to maybe 5-6 hours max?</li>
            <li> cheap product . The lip primer fell right out of the tube when I opened it up...Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Omgg never order the plumper burnt my lips (not literally) it felt like my lips were on fire... The primer just show white ...waist of money</li>
            <li> I find this to keep my lipstick where I want it and the lipstick will last longer than usual, although nothing lasts really long. As for some comments about it lightening the color, that is one reason I like this products. Too often I have bought a color I thought I liked only to find out I didn&#x27;t. This lets me blend colors better, which I do all the time.</li>
            <li> There are two parts to this, the primer and the plumper.  The primer goes on thick and white and does not blend in.  This affects how your lip color goes on and affects the shade.  The plumper tastes nice.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing (if you like cinnamon), but it doesn&#x27;t really plump my lips.  I probably would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> So it does keep my lipstick on longer, actually it stayed on for about 7 hours today. However, it changes the entire shade of your lipstick. I feel that it lightens every thing up as if you actually mixed your lipstick with white. The shade is definitely downgraded with this. Also the plumper is a cinnamon flavor and it burns. It felt like vicks vapor rub! I just dont do minty things well so maybe its my sensitivity. I can admit that I will use this (only primer) if I want to change up my lip color just for fun or if I insist on having my lipstick stay on all day. Other than that, I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love how the primer goes on soft and thin. Its not thick, waxy, sticky, or oily. The plumper smells like pure cinnamon. I like it but some may say its a little too strong but that&#x27;s the plumper ingredients. It goes on clear and very soft. Its not waxy or to oily.</li>
            <li> I like e.l.f. products, but this one is a dud.  First, the lip primer lightens the shade of the lipstick you put on top of it.  Then the plumper does nothing.  The seller carefully wrapped and quickly shipped the item, which I appreciate.  No fault there.  e.l.f. just made a crappy product.</li>
            <li> Not an item I would buy again.  Probably will not be using this in daily routine. It doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference in the looks or longetivity of lip color.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Primer makes any shade of lipstick you put over it a million shades lighter, the plumper is basically a cinnamon chapstick, doesn&#x27;t plump but instead just makes you uncomfortable by burning and stinging your lips with cinnamon (and the smell is really overpowering). Will never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like like like!  Love this product especially for the price and will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump, but smells nice (cinnamon).</li>
            <li> Dont work at all it dont help to my lips makes my lipstick all smug n runny</li>
            <li> This stuff actually keeps lipstick from running. The price is great. I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; but who cares.  Happy</li>
            <li> OMG it burns! It burns! Straight into the trash it goes. I bought this at target, not Amazon. I normally love elf products but this is the worst ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Drug Emporium.  The plumper is okay and works well with Some lip glosses but does not work well with lipstick. The Primer is useless, and feels heavy.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Wal-Mart today and used right away, my plumping end fell off too, I came here to see if anyone else had the burn and yay many did, was thinking I was having a reaction, it did plump my lips temporarily kind of looked like an allergic reaction and as i write, boom...skinny lips again....the primer end sucks wipped it off immediately it just dried and caked up even though I just used an exfoliating stick..pretty useless but it was cheap :)</li>
            <li> The primer has a very nude thick color almost like its own lipstick. This did worry me at first. I cannot use my lip liner pencils over it. I used a little bit of bright purple lipstick [color divine] over it, but only a little bit as I had heavy eye makeup on. It was very smooth, didn&#x27;t wipe off,and actually gave my bright color a more natural look which isn&#x27;t bad. I have yet to put heavy color over it [will it ruin the shade of my particular red?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the plumper tingled more than venom primer did. Still didnt en-flare my lips but who honestly expects that? My main problem was the plumper was completely broken and melted in the cap when i opened it so i have to use a lip brush to scoop it to use it. which i am really bummed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use lip lock so i cant say about its staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was the slowest of all my many amazon buys to arrive, but not slow enough to be irritated.</li>
