            <li> I have half Asian hair, so my hair has a thick cuticle and is smooth, but is also wavy from my mom&#x27;s side</li>

            <li> This is the very first time I have purchased from this seller and I could not be more disappointed!</li>
            <li> A lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> To give an idea of how thick they are, I would theoretically need 4 or 5 packs to do my entire head.</li>
            <li> People with short, thick hair shouldnt only rely the tape in method anyways.</li>
            <li> With that, my hair is a short inverted bob (hits my chin) and has layers so it is SO hard to blend extensions.</li>
            <li> Dark Brown Tape in extensions 2 WEEKS BEFORE</li>
            <li> I ordered #2, Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> This hair was definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> the color #2 (dark brown) is not a true color level 2</li>
            <li> , i ombred in black color, the color when I opened the #2</li>
            <li> The only down side is that they are alittle on the thin side, but they did mention that on the description</li>
            <li> The hair is getting a little dried at this point but its my fault.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known that for such a cheap price I was going to receive a horrible product.</li>
            <li> The 16\\&quot; hair is actually about 14\\&quot; inches with thin ends</li>
            <li> waste of time &amp; money</li>
            <li> (If you want thick wefts, tape/glue some of the wefts to each other)</li>
            <li> The seams are a little to think and hard for my taste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking that I was purchasing thick dark brown hair when in reality I just threw my money away!</li>
            <li> I usually get Remy.</li>
            <li> I am so angry, it&#x27;s going to take years for all my hair to grow back!!</li>
            <li> around your face and temples, there is no better method than the tape in method.</li>
            <li> You could see the tape through my hair and the color was not a #2 more like a #30.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough bad stuff about these messy, stringy hair pieces.</li>
            <li> DO let the extensions sit for at least 2 days before washing again.end extensions.</li>

            <li> worst Quality hair ever! don&#x27;t not buy this I&#x27;m very disappointed after a week all this hair was falling out they got very knotty and were very unhealthy</li>
            <li> I usually get Remy. I am a stylist. The glue is faulty. Didn&#x27;t last 30 min in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased four already lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is so smooth and it looks so nice. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hair too thin... I have used 40 pcs before with my hair and did it this time and it looked completely ridiculous. . Would NOT recommend this hair at all!!!! I have really thin hair and it still did not work at all. You definitely get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be wasting my money or not when I first purchased these extensions, because the price was so much lower then the same product else where. I ordered anyway and BOY AM I GLAD!! These extensions are amazing. The hair is silky and the product is easy peasy to apply ( I did by myself) I also colored the extensions so they would be a perfect match for my own hair. I have attached photo of extensions... The shipping was great, and packaged well.. I am purchasing more in the next few weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using tape in extensions for about 8 months now. It&#x27;s difficult to find a seller that doesn&#x27;t overcharge or take forever to deliver... But I will look no further! I received my 16&amp;#34; Dark Brown Tape in extensions 2 WEEKS BEFORE ORIGINALLY PROMISED!!!! Soooooo excited! I placed another order for blond immediately when I received my order... Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> These are very poor quality. Act like synthetic. They tangle and look terrible after two weeks.  Pay a little more for remy hair.</li>
            <li> This product was an absolute waste of time &amp; money. Absolutely horrible quality bent in half &amp; paper thin. This user really shouldn&#x27;t sell something they wouldn&#x27;t wear them selves. Don&#x27;t BUY!!</li>
            <li> The quality of these were amazing! Coming from a hairdresser, this brand is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Run, run fast away from these products. Run as fast as you can. Do not stop for the go sign, keep on running. Ugh, yuk. I can&#x27;t say enough bad stuff about these messy, stringy hair pieces. I would never let myself get talked into buying such items again.</li>
            <li> I received the hair much faster than the predicted amount of time thankfully. But the hair is just shy of 16\\&quot; and very very very thin at the bottom and looks like damaged hair at the ends. I wanted full and luxurious hair. I ordered two packs which still wasn&#x27;t enough hair for a full head. It was only 30 dollars (each) so i guess it was my moneys worth. AS far as the tape: one of the tracks WASNT EVEN STICKY and could not be used straight from the package. Three others fell out not even within 24 hrs. Im ordering more tape online, but i&#x27;m hoping i don&#x27;t have to buy more hair and just make my own tape extensions because the hair is always so thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I am giving this item a 3 because the extensiions are very thin, Previously i used 3 tho add fullness and now i must use 6 with this product</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving them I received them quickly,  the hair is soft and manageable,  I was able to color match with my hair dye perfectly! The only down side is that they are alittle on the thin side, but they did mention that on the description so I just ordered another set and will add them in to my hair tonight,  as far as washing I will see if they tangle and get back with you about that but so far so good! All in all I am very happy with the product so far and would recommend to anyone who has thin hair and wants length without the wait time, but don&#x27;t want anyone to know that theu are wearing extensions</li>
            <li> The seams are a little to think and hard for my taste. Hair feels like fish scales, instead of the soft natural feeling I got from HotHeads hair extensions. But those are about 10 times more expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Really thin but the price is right and the hair is actually very soft. I higlighted it and colored it and it stool looked relatively in good shape.</li>
            <li> I HATE these extensions, they have begun to give me bald spots!!!!! I want my money back!!!! I bought 3 packs totalling over $60 and they are HORRIBLE!!!!! A waste of money!!!!!!!!! I am so angry, it&#x27;s going to take years for all my hair to grow back!!</li>
            <li> The color is not really dark brown but more of a medium brown.  The texture of the hair is very coarse and dry. After having the hair installed and because of the texture, I have removed a number of the extensions and had my hair stylist thin it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking that I was purchasing thick dark brown hair when in reality I just threw my money away! The hair arrived auburn and WHITE! Yes, WHITE! There are grays everywhere, the hair is red/auburn and I can tell that the white hair didn&#x27;t soak in the dye. The extensions themselves are in horrible condition, full of split ends and they&#x27;re also very brittle and heat damaged (I would know, my actual hair is in that same condition.) This is the very first time I have purchased from this seller and I could not be more disappointed! I should&#x27;ve known that for such a cheap price I was going to receive a horrible product. I am very very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Overall: to rate tape in extensions, this is pretty good hair for the price. Don&#x27;t expect anything phenomenal, but this is not a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair is decent quality for the price! The tape in process was easy, although on some areas on the head above the ears) they tend to slip out (just brush on with stronger hair glue when applying to certain areas). The hair does not tangle which is awesome. The only complaints I have is that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- 1) the color #2 (dark brown) is not a true color level 2 (however I did color them before application and the hair took just fine, i ombred in black color, the color when I opened the #2 was more like a level 4 or 5.)&lt;br /&gt;---2)They do shed quite a bit :(&lt;br /&gt;---3) The 16\\&quot; hair is actually about 14\\&quot; inches with thin ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if youre looking to just blend your top hair line, the nape of your neck, or around your face and temples, there is no better method than the tape in method. (No one with short thick hair should do the same kind of hair extension method for a whole head, it takes a combination of methods for short hair for long extensions to blend). I would recommend this product if youre looking to save money and need lots of different types of extensions for your head! To give an idea of how thick they are, I would theoretically need 4 or 5 packs to do my entire head. But tape in extensions are SUPPOSED to be thin! No one is going to get a believable blend if they were thick! Plus, with the type of bonding used to make tape in hair, there is no way to make each weft thick without having even more shedding. (If you want thick wefts, tape/glue some of the wefts to each other) People with short, thick hair shouldnt only rely the tape in method anyways. I have half Asian hair, so my hair has a thick cuticle and is smooth, but is also wavy from my mom&#x27;s side and therefore my hair has a ton of volume. With that, my hair is a short inverted bob (hits my chin) and has layers so it is SO hard to blend extensions. When I put these in around my face it blended very well because the short hair was covered completely by the sandwiching the wefts. DO wash your hair with clarifying shampoo/baby shampoo and no conditioner before application so the adhesive can completely bond. DO let the extensions sit for at least 2 days before washing again.end extensions.

            <li> Love the hair but the tape wasn&#x27;t sticky enough. Also, shipping was a bit slow. But, I do love the hair!</li>
            <li> I just received my order today. It arrived in 9 days. A lot sooner than expected. I ordered #2, Dark Brown. It was a bit lighter than what I was expecting but, that was better than it being darker. It does feel very silky &amp; has a nice healthy shine to it. I have thin hair &amp; am going for length. I have not put them in yet &amp; will post a review after I do so.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality!</li>
            <li> Was not enough for full head even though I bought two package sent it back same day I recieved it..waste of time &amp; money</li>
            <li> This hair was definitely not worth it. You could see the tape through my hair and the color was not a #2 more like a #30. I&#x27;ll opt for a different brand.... I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I&#x27;ve had them for about a month. The hair is getting a little dried at this point but its my fault. I went to the ocean. And I probably wash them more than I should. Using a leave in conditioner and oil on them help a ton. I also try to brush them and braid them before I sleep on them to help avoid from knotting and ratting.  So far so good.</li>
