            <li>:) Its so easy to use and nice to just switch over when I need to use another gun.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Mostly for compactness.</li>
            <li>It runs my machines stronger, smoother and you have more control.</li>
            <li>Ok, esta es una excelente fuente de poder para mis maquinas de tatuajes, la informacion en la pantalla es muy util para calibrar las maquinas lo mejor posible.</li>
            <li>works a lot better then</li>
            <li>They work alot better now.</li>
            <li>I have the eikon power supply which is just like this one but cost a lot more money.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Product is ok didn&#x27;t have some features I was looking for in a power</li>
            <li>I wanted a lot more</li>
            <li>Ok, this is a great power supply for my tattoo machines, the information in the display is very useful for set the machines as good as possible.</li>
            <li>Runs machine clean!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Its just as cheap, regulated and just as compact as the one your looking at, but much better.</li>
            <li>This machine has a good working flow of low and high volts.one of the best I had and greatly works all around with my guns.my tattoo artist had this same one</li>
            <li>but I got this one right after my last one crapped out and its perfect</li>
            <li>I did one tattoo with it and worked fine.</li>
            <li>Tattoo power supply did not work all it did was light up but did not switch from liner to Shadar or did not send power to the machine</li>
            <li>he is a professional tattooer and it works great and runs his machines very well.</li>
            <li>This Product Is A Good Power Supply For Someone That&#x27;s Starting To Tattoo.</li>
            <li>Cheaply built,and very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>If your going to spend the money, this is a more professional upgrade.</li>
            <li>supply.would have liked to see individual setting for the shader and liner ..</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the more expensive supplies and this thing can hold it own.</li>
            <li>the dual machine is over rated stick with a single machine and adjust when you switch save yourself the headaches its a good machine for beginners but it can&#x27;t really handle more than i say around 6 hours before it starts cutting out for easy flash no problems but for nice shading and blending it sometimes like to surge for no reason with anything over a 11mag</li>
            <li>Today was the first time that I used this power supply.</li>
            <li>I had another client in after the first one</li>
            <li>glad I only paid $50.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with it at first</li>
            <li>but i wouldn&#x27;t use this for a big custom piece it has no problems with 3 and 5 liners its actually very smooth nice for small quick pieces but</li>
            <li>Overall, the supply has consistent power when u get it to the sweet spot!  </li>
            <li>the supply is ok not good not horrible</li>
            <li>Ive always been just a scratch artist for a lot of years and used a lot of simple, cheap tattooing power supplies.</li>
            <li>really like the 2 gun option with a flip of the switch.</li>
            <li>I have plugged it into many different plug-ins in the walls and it will not turn back on.</li>
            <li>I took the switchable set up out of my old, cheap power supply and set it up outside this one and mounted undernieth the counter.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used to give my canvas a new tattoo yet</li>
            <li>But, I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that before I can use a new product.</li>
            <li>I fully recommend this power supply to any busy tattoo artist.</li>
            <li>had to use my old parts.</li>
            <li>This power supply is just as good as the expensive one that I have.</li>
            <li>but it is my last resort unit i would say buy professional and spend the extra $100-$200 you wont regret it with this unit i constantly find myself adjusting it more than my other power supplies it doesn&#x27;t seem to keep a steady current</li>
            <li>and there is some lag in responsiveness nothing major and</li>

            <li> nothing serious unless your doing sessions with a client i used this supply for around 50-70 tattoos</li>
            <li> the foot pedal was no good , and 2.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this about a month ago, soon as I took it out of the box there were pieces rattling around on the inside, after repairing this, I got about 2 weeks of use before the on/off button fell apart on on the inside. last night it died. Good thing I keep 2 backups. Do not buy this! Cheaply built,and very dissatisfied. Spend the money on a good reliable supply</li>
            <li> What Else Can I Say Good Quality Good Service Fast Shipment Just How It Describes The Item SO Buy It If You Want It</li>
            <li> Love it guys thank you works great thank again</li>
            <li> I got this power supply 2 weeks ago. Today was the first time that I used this power supply. I did one tattoo with it and worked fine. I had another client in after the first one and I had to move the power supply so I simply unplugged it and moved it to the other table. I plugged it back in and it will no longer turn on. I have plugged it into many different plug-ins in the walls and it will not turn back on. I thought I was getting a quality and durable power supply, but I was not told it was a one time use machine. I never dropped it or got it wet. Returning this item immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought this here on Amazon. Ive always been just a scratch artist for a lot of years and used a lot of simple, cheap tattooing power supplies. Mostly for compactness. I spent 90 bucks on this thing when upgrading my kit. If your an amature upgrading I would recommend this:    Its just as cheap, regulated and just as compact as the one your looking at, but much better. If your going to spend the money, this is a more professional upgrade. Just be a hobbiest and hook up your clip-cord and foot switch connections externally..I took the switchable set up out of my old, cheap power supply and set it up outside this one and mounted undernieth the counter. It runs my machines stronger, smoother and you have more control. I hope that helps you.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal and worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, this is a great power supply for my tattoo machines, the information in the display is very useful for set the machines as good as possible. I recomend it 100%... Excelent... and about the seller, great the product came on time.     Ok, esta es una excelente fuente de poder para mis maquinas de tatuajes, la informacion en la pantalla es muy util para calibrar las maquinas lo mejor posible. la recomiendo 100%... Excelente... Y sobre el Vendedor, Muy bien, el producto llego a tiempo.</li>
            <li> Runs machine clean! works a lot better then the one that comes in any kit. So if your on a budget I would buy this power supply</li>
            <li> This is another case of you get what you pay for. It works but the adjustment knob is a pain (3or 4 turns just to adjust 0.5V) and it only has one setting for both outputs</li>
            <li> This Product Is A Good Power Supply For Someone That&#x27;s Starting To Tattoo. I Recommend This Product, Kinda Same To An Expensive One.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality but it works well, used it on 10 tattoos</li>
            <li> i got what i paid for its not the best or worst power supply i have used but it is my last resort unit i would say buy professional and spend the extra $100-$200 you wont regret it with this unit i constantly find myself adjusting it more than my other power supplies it doesn&#x27;t seem to keep a steady current and there is some lag in responsiveness nothing major and the dual machine is over rated stick with a single machine and adjust when you switch save yourself the headaches its a good machine for beginners but it can&#x27;t really handle more than i say around 6 hours before it starts cutting out for easy flash no problems but for nice shading and blending it sometimes like to surge for no reason with anything over a 11mag maybe it was just the machine i received but i wouldn&#x27;t use this for a big custom piece it has no problems with 3 and 5 liners its actually very smooth nice for small quick pieces but nothing serious unless your doing sessions with a client i used this supply for around 50-70 tattoos and it still runs so that has to stand for something and buy good clip cords from what i remember they weren&#x27;t very good overall the supply is ok not good not horrible it will get the job done best for a beginner or your apprentice</li>
            <li> Tattoo power supply did not work all it did was light up but did not switch from liner to Shadar or did not send power to the machine so I had to send it back</li>
            <li> This machine has a good working flow of low and high volts.one of the best I had and greatly works all around with my guns.my tattoo artist had this same one so I know it was good from the start.im glad I only paid $50. I hated it took 2 weeks to arrive whan it said it would be shipped earlier.</li>
            <li> Works well for what i need</li>
            <li> Ordered this due to a issue with the previous power supply I had. Got this in and installed and seen and heard a great difference in my machines. They work alot better now. Haven&#x27;t used to give my canvas a new tattoo yet but I&#x27;m sure it will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> got here on time but... no clip cord or foot switch???  ad said w/clip cord and foot switch. feel a bit cheated.</li>
            <li> Overall, the supply has consistent power when u get it to the sweet spot!  Great display features,  which let u tune ur machine to maximum potential!</li>
            <li> Power supply does not turn on when plugged in</li>
            <li> I have the eikon power supply which is just like this one but cost a lot more money. This power supply is just as good as the expensive one that I have. I use this power supply today for a 7 hour tattoo and it worked excellent. I fully recommend this power supply to any busy tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> How do i preset the voltage for each machine?</li>
            <li> did not receive my pedal or clip cord. had to use my old parts. and it only lasted one tattoo. dont work no more .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it! I bought it for his birthday and he loves it! he is a professional tattooer and it works great and runs his machines very well. great buy! very happy</li>
            <li> I love this. I got it and it looked great. I had an issue with it at first but I&#x27;m not working with the seller and they are very very nice and pleased to help me. Great buy. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It breaks at the 3 try just power off</li>
            <li> Product is ok didn&#x27;t have some features I was looking for in a power supply.would have liked to see individual setting for the shader and liner ..</li>
            <li> this worked great for about three tattoo&#x27;s now im stuck with it and im upsette to say the least as I bought new foot peddles and all now when they arrive I have a big paper weight to attach them to for this price I wanted a lot more and I mean a lot more I am not happy at all</li>
            <li> This power supply is junk. Bogs out, doesnt hold current after 10 minutes of work and you will struggle to put a tattoo in using this crap.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed... 1. the foot pedal was no good , and 2. The toggle switch was bad and made the whole supply short out.  Since replacing the toggle switch and foot pedal all has worked well. But, I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that before I can use a new product.</li>
            <li> Was looking to get rid of the heavy power supply i had and found this one. This item is perfect if you travel with your gear and works great. really like the 2 gun option with a flip of the switch. I have tried many of the more expensive supplies and this thing can hold it own. No bogging or voltage drop runs very smooth</li>
            <li> I had bought a different tattoo power supply machine on amazon and it was horrible but I got this one right after my last one crapped out and its perfect :) Its so easy to use and nice to just switch over when I need to use another gun.</li>
            <li> This product did not even last an hour before it broke down. I am now having to return it and try to get my money back. What a hassle...</li>
