            <li>My boyfriend and I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I am glad somebody decided to copy it, but I just thought I would let everyone know that P. Diddy didn&#x27;t INVENT this</li>
            <li>I love it and so did my brother in law.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, but not like I remembered from One bought at the store.</li>
            <li>if should  come  across some more  </li>
            <li>Ladies love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne ever.</li>
            <li>It smells so sensual and sexy, any man (or woman)</li>
            <li>No complaints :)</li>
            <li>My dad love this, my brother loves this</li>
            <li>, my fish love this, Jesus even Loves this.</li>
            <li>Need I say more??</li>
            <li>Great price,  fast shipment</li>
            <li>My wife got me a sample of this when she ordered from Sephora, and we both loved it from the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>It is just the most amazing fresh, clean, not too strong scent.</li>
            <li>actually strong as hell.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much and bought one for my dad as a gift from amazon.</li>
            <li>and I must admit it has a unique smell that is not too strong</li>
            <li>Has a smooth creamy-ness about it as well.  </li>
            <li>Then the cheap ink-jet printed bar code was stuck over the gouges in order to hide the work.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for this cologn at the best price and found it!!!</li>
            <li>Having owned the original</li>
            <li>I found a bar code adhered to the spot where my original box had a stamped \\&quot;AA9\\&quot; plus another 5-digit code.</li>
            <li>This is youthful and cool, without being immature or feminine.</li>
            <li>He must&#x27;ve loved it because he used the entire bottle in a month!  </li>
            <li>Smells really good and last.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a fresh &amp; clean scent.</li>
            <li>This 3.4 oz bottle is a great deal, too -- as long as you know for sure that you really want that much of this stuff.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, heavy on sweet citrus with orange notes being prominent.  </li>
            <li>great price one of my favorites for everyday cologn</li>
            <li>It was delivered right away</li>
            <li>Like most people, I love a nice smelling cologne that&#x27;s not too heavy scent, but last.</li>
            <li>my hubby was happy to have a larger bottle for the same price.</li>
            <li>Its really pricy!</li>
            <li>OMG, the first time i smelled this it was on my ex boyfriend.</li>
            <li>you can buy many other nice colognes with the same price.</li>
            <li>It actually arrived way sooner than I expected, great condition.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, but it doesnt last long...</li>
            <li>scent goes away fast.</li>
            <li>Since this is a tester, I haven&#x27;t been getting as much compliments as before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no Sean John fan, but this cologne is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very linear.  </li>
            <li>think it is not the genuine product for obvious reasons, although it smells similar.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>wonder it was $36.57 compared to $57.99 at Target for the real</li>
            <li>the smell is very nice but it only lasts about 10 minutes not recommend them is a waste of money .........</li>
            <li>I would never purchase it anywhere near regular retail price, but there are some decent deals available for the 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s completely non-offensive, and girls really do like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, unobtrusive scent that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>But with the \\&quot;I Am King\\&quot; cologne, there&#x27;s hardly no fragrance or scent at all.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much i would always by him it as a gift afterwards, selfishly.</li>
            <li>I am usually a David Beckham guy, but this scent got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Well my sneaky husband found it early but he Loves it!</li>
            <li>Not a bad version, he just doesn&#x27;t deserve the praise hoisted upon him by unsuspecting customers who think he is hawking something \\&quot; original \\&quot; or \\&quot; cutting edge \\&quot; when it is MOST DEFINITELY NOT SO...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like musky, old scents.</li>
            <li>It was  packaged very well also  maybe in the future</li>
            <li>A very close female friend of mine bought me this years ago as a gift</li>
            <li>I recommend to buy sprays from stores directly rather than order online.</li>
            <li>it was exactly was I expected.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> sell doesn&#x27;t last long enough as before.</li>
            <li> Just the only thing that bugs me is the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say this purchase was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really bigger than the other bottles I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> so it does not linger very long.</li>
            <li> He ripped off the House of Creed&#x27;s \\&quot; Green Irish Tweed \\&quot; with \\&quot; Unforgivable \\&quot;, and now \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I removed the sticker and found that the alpha-numeric code was carefully punched or gouged out.</li>
            <li> Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in the fragrance world it&#x27;s cutthroat to the core.  </li>
            <li> I always recommend this to other guys too when the subject of colognes come about.</li>
            <li> but thats my only complaint.</li>
            <li> My previous cologne of choice was Eternity for Men, but this blows that out of the water.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the fragrance, I immediately compared it to my previous bottle and box.</li>
            <li> On my previous bottle the corresponding code was \\&quot;AA9\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It appears that it was carefully scalpel-cut and the small square containing the code was removed.</li>
            <li> I only wear a couple fragrances and this bad boy is definitely in the arsenal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how the company makes it or what, but at least I didn&#x27;t spend over $50 for it.</li>
            <li> The scent is so faint, that you have to spray large amounts on just to get a faint scent, and even then the faint scent is gone in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird when you spray it on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t buy this watered-down version of that expensive juice.  </li>
            <li> , he blatantly STOLE IT from the House of Creed.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when a persons cologne arrive before they do, because I don&#x27;t like heavy scents.</li>
            <li> am disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> People hate on it because of its name or because its from Diddy&#x27;s company, but I like</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always get compliments from the ladies when I am wearing this.  It is a must have for any night out.</li>
            <li> scent goes away fast.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, but it doesnt last long... It&#x27;s weird when you spray it on it comes out real strong... actually strong as hell. Then after an hour or so it fades...</li>
            <li> the smell is very nice but it only lasts about 10 minutes not recommend them is a waste of money .........</li>
            <li> I purchased the fragrance for my husband and he loves it.  Great Summer scent.</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to my roster. I am usually a David Beckham guy, but this scent got so many compliments. It&#x27;s a very trendy smell. I don&#x27;t like musky, old scents. This is youthful and cool, without being immature or feminine.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a fresh &amp; clean scent. Its a wonderful scent for any man.....[[ASIN:B001UJ9XPI SEAN JOHN I AM KING by Sean John EDT SPRAY 3.4 OZ for MEN]]</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I love this cologne. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Sean \\&quot; P. Diddy \\&quot; Combs is the KING... of Creed fragrances ripoffs.  This is an almost identical carbon copy of the $250.00 a bottle for 2.5 oz \\&quot; Millesime Imperial \\&quot; by CREED.  He ripped off the House of Creed&#x27;s \\&quot; Green Irish Tweed \\&quot; with \\&quot; Unforgivable \\&quot;, and now \\&quot; Millesime Imperial \\&quot; is \\&quot; I Am King \\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t buy this watered-down version of that expensive juice.  Having owned the original I am glad somebody decided to copy it, but I just thought I would let everyone know that P. Diddy didn&#x27;t INVENT this, he blatantly STOLE IT from the House of Creed.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in the fragrance world it&#x27;s cutthroat to the core.  Not a bad version, he just doesn&#x27;t deserve the praise hoisted upon him by unsuspecting customers who think he is hawking something \\&quot; original \\&quot; or \\&quot; cutting edge \\&quot; when it is MOST DEFINITELY NOT SO...</li>
            <li> sell doesn&#x27;t last long enough as before.</li>

            <li> This was a gift from me. I love it and so did my brother in law.</li>

This 3.4 oz bottle is a great deal, too -- as long as you know for sure that you really want that much of this stuff. I only use one cologne at a time, so I don&#x27;t mind having enough to last me for months.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, but not like I remembered from One bought at the store. So I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this.</li>
            <li> Smells good for about five minutes after that it smells like horses***</li>
            <li> Since this is a tester, I haven&#x27;t been getting as much compliments as before. I feel that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with this cologne. Its really pricy! you can buy many other nice colognes with the same price.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, great price!</li>
            <li> This is perfect to wear as an every day product. It works for either day or not. Always have this one on the shelf</li>

            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.  it was exactly was I expected.  It was packaged great and was a nice size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> A very good product for a very reasonable price. The quality was good and it was as it appeared. Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> i have no problem with the product, yes the scent is very light so it does not linger very long. if you want something to last you through out the day with just a squirt in the morning time i suggest you get a musky cologne. saying that the shipping for this took for freakin ever (2weeks with amazon prime) i dont know what the deal was but thats my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> GOt this for my brother for Christmas.  He must&#x27;ve loved it because he used the entire bottle in a month!  Who does that?</li>
            <li> Well my sneaky husband found it early but he Loves it! He was thrilled with the gift. Price is great for the size!!!</li>
            <li> My husband got a sample of this and we loved it.  He&#x27;s been using it for a couple of years now and he gets tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> OMG, the first time i smelled this it was on my ex boyfriend. It is just the most amazing fresh, clean, not too strong scent. I loved it so much i would always by him it as a gift afterwards, selfishly. I always recommend this to other guys too when the subject of colognes come about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no Sean John fan, but this cologne is the real deal.  Ladies love it.  I only wear a couple fragrances and this bad boy is definitely in the arsenal.</li>
            <li> He loved it! Smells really good and last. Time to order another one. Wish they still sold it in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage son to follow-up with his Unforgiveable cologne that I bought him before.  It is a wonderful scent and I am positive he will love it.  The package arrive one time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne ever. It smells so sensual and sexy, any man (or woman) wearing it is instantly delicious  ;)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, heavy on sweet citrus with orange notes being prominent.  Has a smooth creamy-ness about it as well.  It&#x27;s very linear.  People hate on it because of its name or because its from Diddy&#x27;s company, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been accused of being too feminine and I can see that, but it&#x27;s completely non-offensive, and girls really do like it.  I would never purchase it anywhere near regular retail price, but there are some decent deals available for the 3.4 oz. here on Amazon, or it can also be had at low prices sometimes at discounters like Ross or Marshalls.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because of the size it&#x27;s really bigger than the other bottles I&#x27;ve gotten. Just the only thing that bugs me is the smell doesn&#x27;t last long I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how the company makes it or what, but at least I didn&#x27;t spend over $50 for it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It actually arrived way sooner than I expected, great condition. No complaints :)</li>
            <li> A very close female friend of mine bought me this years ago as a gift and I must admit it has a unique smell that is not too strong and I often receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the fragrance, I immediately compared it to my previous bottle and box. Here is what I found: the boxes and bottles appear to be the same, but the info sticker on the bottom of the bottle has the identification code cut out. It appears that it was carefully scalpel-cut and the small square containing the code was removed. On my previous bottle the corresponding code was \\&quot;AA9\\&quot;. Then I compared the boxes. I found a bar code adhered to the spot where my original box had a stamped \\&quot;AA9\\&quot; plus another 5-digit code. I removed the sticker and found that the alpha-numeric code was carefully punched or gouged out. Then the cheap ink-jet printed bar code was stuck over the gouges in order to hide the work.&lt;br /&gt;What is a person to think?&lt;br /&gt;I think it is not the genuine product for obvious reasons, although it smells similar.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder it was $36.57 compared to $57.99 at Target for the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in Amazon. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this cologn at the best price and found it!!! my hubby was happy to have a larger bottle for the same price.</li>
            <li> My hubbie LOVED it.. the price was good also..</li>
            <li> great price one of my favorites for everyday cologn</li>
            <li> My dad love this, my brother loves this, My husband loves this, My pastor loves this, my teacher loves this, my dog loves this, my fish love this, Jesus even Loves this. Buy this for your man. Need I say more??</li>
            <li> I bough the spray as it had a nice fragrance when i happened to check out the tester at one of the stores. I liked it very much and bought one for my dad as a gift from amazon. But the product bought from amazon seemed to be adulterated. I recommend to buy sprays from stores directly rather than order online.</li>
            <li> I purchase it for my husband birthday.... I am so please with it... Great price,  fast shipment and I would recommend it..</li>
            <li> Smells linger for hours even into the next day great product</li>
            <li> I look forward to writing good/bad reviews on Amazon.com (I prefer writing good review). Like most people, I love a nice smelling cologne that&#x27;s not too heavy scent, but last. I&#x27;ve worn Unforgivable By Sean John before, and loved the fragrance. However, I purchased \\&quot;I Am King\\&quot; based on the \\&quot;rave\\&quot; reviews posted on Amazon.com (all reviews are subjective). I am not exaggerating when I say this purchase was a complete waste of money. I hate it when a persons cologne arrive before they do, because I don&#x27;t like heavy scents. But with the \\&quot;I Am King\\&quot; cologne, there&#x27;s hardly no fragrance or scent at all. The scent is so faint, that you have to spray large amounts on just to get a faint scent, and even then the faint scent is gone in about 30 minutes. Not a good buy.</li>
