            <li>Great price for this product!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
            <li>One of the best products i have used ...</li>
            <li>Im thinking together or alone, they both are excellent.  </li>
            <li>These 2 products are the best.</li>
            <li>Very good product.  </li>
            <li>It  has a lot to do with a beautiful complexion to start.</li>
            <li>great product, great delivery</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>In fact,&lt;br /&gt;please let the company know that at 68 years of age, I would be happy to be a spokesman for this&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and I think this product is a good product.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using cell like C products I have gotten compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>so I saw in one of the reviews that the B-complex would be a good combo.  </li>
            <li>Been using for a month and this solution is exceptional.</li>
            <li>And since its mostly hyaluronic acid without any oils, it&#x27;s great for those who have a tendency to break out.</li>
            <li>The service was outstanding!</li>
            <li>Love this product though!    </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smoother, tighter and clarity of tone is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so well that I went online to search for it.</li>
            <li>I find them effective and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>The one treatment I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li>Great product --- delivered very promptly!</li>
            <li>I found it made my senior skin feel firmer and look better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Does my face feel better and would I buy it again?</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Truly love Cellex C ;</li>
            <li>Love this product - have used for years.</li>
            <li>I also wait about 5 minutes after I apply the C-serum to make sure it&#x27;s soaked into my skin before I use the B-complex.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon offers some great prices on this product line too...</li>
            <li>The product is a nice texture and seems to be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, it&#x27;s light a face lift in a bottle.</li>
            <li>On days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup, I&#x27;ll put this on followed by a light creamy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>My husband loves the fact that other men are always telling him what a beautiful wife he has.  </li>
            <li>Good addition for an extra moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This works great with the Cellex c  and my other products .love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soothing and never burns your skin - great if you&#x27;ve overdone it with other products.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>You can tell that it hydrates your face and makes it feel a lot better and not dried out.</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>love this stuff - makes my face clear.</li>
            <li>This product was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply with only a drop or two needed.  </li>
            <li>It goes on my face smooth and made all other products absorbs better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I was given my first bottle of Cellix-C Hydra 5B.</li>
            <li>Feels sticky at first</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>and I tend to break out with too much use</li>
            <li>let you know thanks Jennifer</li>
            <li>this product so much.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates and plumps your skin.  </li>
            <li>One drop is all you need to slather your whole face.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky and leaves my face sticky.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>This product is good, but it is seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit older, so if you&#x27;re younger, you probably wouldn&#x27;t need the extra moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>but then I am a \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; wife.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tacky when you first put it on, but after a moment your skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually pay so much for my skin care products, and Cellex-C cost more than I&#x27;d usually pay, but I like it so much I searched until I found Amazon&#x27;s more reasonable price, and purchased this, my second, bottle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this and Cellex</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the second time ordering this product and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so I&#x27;m not sure what it would do in that case.</li>
            <li>I my face is looking less red and more growing</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying them so far</li>
            <li>In morning I place it on my face after Cellex Professional Serum.  </li>
            <li>Only one drawback, when using dropper, there is a possibility that too much is dropping into my palm because after rubbing it into my skin, takes awhile for all of it to absorb in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it after applying Professional Serum.  </li>
            <li>Was using Professional Serum, then applying a moisturizer before I purchased this</li>
            <li>and my skin felt soft, with enhanced clarity and reduced pores.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tried to steel away to other products once in a while but still comes back to this one.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;m not waiting long enough in between applying Professional Serum and this B Complex.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Along side some other Cellex C products I have been using this brand for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be enhanced with other minerals and vitamins.</li>
            <li> line can get a little costly for your average consumer.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I&#x27;d rather feel a little assured about it</li>
            <li> Just wish it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper on price.</li>
            <li> have had problem skin and there are few products that are not too harsh but take care of the issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> , it comes to my rescue if and when I have a break out and the pimple is gone within a day or two as I&#x27;m a terrible picker type person which only makes any pimple I get worse, this product makes me stop picking and clears up my skin at a rapid pace, can&#x27;t beat it, love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results yet, and I&#x27;m just not sure about it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how those enhancements affected my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  </li>
            <li> Have I seen any dramatic changes since I have been using it?</li>
            <li> It is expensive though,</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the product by my longtime facialist and she has never given me bad advice.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> WOWOW!! what a find! Great price for this product! The service was outstanding! My order arrived quickly. I will definitely order again from this website!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now. I&#x27;ve heard it was \\&quot;lightning in a bottle\\&quot;. I was recommended it for lines around the eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day. I don&#x27;t see any results yet, and I&#x27;m just not sure about it. I will keep using it for a while.  But for the price, I&#x27;d rather feel a little assured about it and I don&#x27;t, not yet.</li>
            <li> Same exact product I have used in the past from a Dr. office.  So moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> I really like this, it comes to my rescue if and when I have a break out and the pimple is gone within a day or two as I&#x27;m a terrible picker type person which only makes any pimple I get worse, this product makes me stop picking and clears up my skin at a rapid pace, can&#x27;t beat it, love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Hydra 5B in combination with Cellex C.  I have used these products for 14 years.  It is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> (This is from Jerry&#x27;s wife).  I was given my first bottle of Cellix-C Hydra 5B. I found it made my senior skin feel firmer and look better. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so I&#x27;m not sure what it would do in that case. I liked it so well that I went online to search for it. I don&#x27;t usually pay so much for my skin care products, and Cellex-C cost more than I&#x27;d usually pay, but I like it so much I searched until I found Amazon&#x27;s more reasonable price, and purchased this, my second, bottle. A little goes a long way. I wipe the backs of my hands with what&#x27;s left over after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Works over time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is expensive though, but then I am a \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; wife.  My husband loves the fact that other men are always telling him what a beautiful wife he has.  It  has a lot to do with a beautiful complexion to start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I think this product is a good product. I use it on my face after I shave and before I put on a moisturizer. You can tell that it hydrates your face and makes it feel a lot better and not dried out. Have I seen any dramatic changes since I have been using it? Not really. Does my face feel better and would I buy it again? Absolutely. It is cheaper here on Amazon and I think it is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> So worth it! Keeps skin so hydrated! Absolutely amazing. Wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it! I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this product and I like it very much.  I have had to adapt my usage to once during a 24 hours period instead of the day and night as suggested.  I have sensitive skin and I tend to break out with too much use but I find I have that issue with several facial products.  All in all, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Always.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10years and love it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years after learning about it from my plastic surgeon&#x27;s Spa Office.  It has delayed wrinkles for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply with only a drop or two needed.  Feels sticky at first but that disappears.  Seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> great product, great delivery</li>
            <li> love this stuff - makes my face clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying them so far I think the  C serum is too diluted fat I my face is looking less red and more growing suppose i just don&#x27;t Know if its from the B complexI let you know thanks Jennifer</li>
            <li> One of the best products i have used ... lol  since i have used this product all the last 20 some years.  I tried to steel away to other products once in a while but still comes back to this one.  It goes on my face smooth and made all other products absorbs better in my opinion.  Just wish it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper on price.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 20 years and get compliments on my skin freguently.</li>
            <li> I have seen a rapid decrease in wrinkles and lines with two weeks.  I would definitely buy this product again.  In fact,&lt;br /&gt;please let the company know that at 68 years of age, I would be happy to be a spokesman for this&lt;br /&gt;product. Get with it &amp;#34;baby boomers&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Great product.  This works great with the Cellex c  and my other products .love this product so much. Will buy</li>
            <li> Great product --- delivered very promptly!</li>
            <li> Good addition for an extra moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I had not used the Cellex products until recently.  I find them effective and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I had italy custom problem.&lt;br /&gt;The product is eccellent but i don&#x27;t want to buy this item with amazon in the future&lt;br /&gt;I think amazon must to alert the italian customers about this.</li>
            <li> Along side some other Cellex C products I have been using this brand for years.&lt;br /&gt;I have had problem skin and there are few products that are not too harsh but take care of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;These products are gentle but very effective.  I was introduced to the product by my longtime facialist and she has never given me bad advice.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers some great prices on this product line too...if you can find them.&lt;br /&gt;The line can get a little costly for your average consumer.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but it is seriously overpriced. You can search around and find cheaper hyaluronic acid sellers. This product is supposed to be enhanced with other minerals and vitamins. I am not sure how those enhancements affected my skin. I have ordered a cheaper (and larger) brand, and I am going to see how the two compare on my skin. This product was worth a try. It kept my skin clear, so I can&#x27;t say it was a total waste.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that swears by this product.  She said I should see results within days.  I have used it for 3 weeks now, and have seen no changes what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the entire bottle (a 3 month period).  I have not seen any changes what-so-ever.  It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, it&#x27;s light a face lift in a bottle. I wear this serum under my face lotion. It&#x27;s a little tacky when you first put it on, but after a moment your skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This serum is a part of my daily routine; I use it beneath my primer and tinted moisturizer.  It really hydrates and plumps your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years now and recently have combined it with Ole Henricksen&#x27;s Truth Serum.  One drop is all you need to slather your whole face.  On days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup, I&#x27;ll put this on followed by a light creamy moisturizer.  I&#x27;m a bit older, so if you&#x27;re younger, you probably wouldn&#x27;t need the extra moisturizer on top.  When used alone, your skin feels like you put egg white on it - it feels tighter. .  Oh and I have rosacea.  It&#x27;s also soothing and never burns your skin - great if you&#x27;ve overdone it with other products.  And since its mostly hyaluronic acid without any oils, it&#x27;s great for those who have a tendency to break out.</li>
            <li> Only been using this about 5 days and already can feel the difference. In morning I place it on my face after Cellex Professional Serum.  Only one drawback, when using dropper, there is a possibility that too much is dropping into my palm because after rubbing it into my skin, takes awhile for all of it to absorb in my skin.  Or maybe I&#x27;m not waiting long enough in between applying Professional Serum and this B Complex.  Going to try using this alone at night before retiring to see if there is an appreciable difference.  I&#x27;ll figure it out ;o).  Love this product though!    UPDATE::  Been using for a month and this solution is exceptional. Skin feels smoother, tighter and clarity of tone is amazing.  Keep in mind I use it after applying Professional Serum.  Im thinking together or alone, they both are excellent.  Was using Professional Serum, then applying a moisturizer before I purchased this and my skin felt soft, with enhanced clarity and reduced pores.  Truly love Cellex C ;o)</li>
            <li> Love this product - have used for years.</li>
            <li> I may not have used for a long enough period to see any change. The product is a nice texture and seems to be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this and Cellex -C.  These 2 products are the best.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using cell like C products I have gotten compliments on how good my skin looks. Try so cellex-c  you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The one treatment I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this product is really for.  I had purchased the vitamin C serum and it was drying out my skin so I saw in one of the reviews that the B-complex would be a good combo.  I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  It is very sticky and leaves my face sticky.  If I try to apply my moisturizer and make up over it, it leaves a white flaky residue that I have to wipe off with a tissue.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks.  I only use one drop of this so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using too much of the product.  I also wait about 5 minutes after I apply the C-serum to make sure it&#x27;s soaked into my skin before I use the B-complex.</li>
