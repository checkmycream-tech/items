            <li>I shared it to my roommate loved it!</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t cause bumps or   irritation.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the best stuff I&#x27;ve shaved with is one of the multi-use soaps that I won&#x27;t name for fear of being labeled a shill for the company.</li>
            <li>a quarter size of this gel on each cheek does beautifully</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It also does a great job keeping my legs moisturized.</li>
            <li>I feel great afterwards, without any razor burn.</li>
            <li>After a shower it works great.</li>
            <li>Plus they have great sales from time to time.</li>
            <li>Also the seller is great</li>

            <li>good piece I love work perfect</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Tried as free sample from their FB page, and this gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>My face never felt so good.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It gives me a good shave but not a close shave.</li>
            <li>You have to use quite a lot and the glide isn&#x27;t as nearly as good as Tend Skin Air.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Oliveology is a wonderful gel that is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great shave for  easily irritated skin</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell, feels amazing, and you don&#x27;t even need aftershave...</li>
            <li>Its nothing too amazing over the vegan products that I had used before for shaving.</li>
            <li>It is especially useful since it is transparent</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>It kind of has the consistency of aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>Very good product for those who like Natural production</li>
            <li>This product works better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>so I will have to order more.</li>
            <li>my husband love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was pleased most by the amount of gel I needed to apply.</li>
            <li>Oliveology is better than any shave gel I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Kudos to Oliveology for making such a great shaving product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year, and have recommended it to many people.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is gentle on the skin leaving you moisturised after a shave.</li>
            <li>Way better compared to Gillette, Nivea&#x27;s of the world.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will serve me well for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an oil that lubricates your face allowing the razor to slide easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oliveology for a few months now and can say that this is honestly the best shaving product I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
            <li>The shave gel allows the razor to glide smoothly over your face and makes the shaving experience a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and more moist than can aerosol type products</li>
            <li>I bought this for the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time for a good straight razor shave with a brush and soap or cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless, colorless, and not lathery to the point that you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing (it doesn&#x27;t lather at all unless you REALLY work it up anyways, so that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li>Has left me with a good experience-!</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor blade sharp, holds a close shave, no razor bumps, no cuts, and best of all</li>
            <li>I would easily give it 5 stars if the formula was thicker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all sticky in any way and can easily be rinsed from you razor blade and your skin.</li>
            <li>and I needed to get to the sink to clean off my razor which took more time and effort than I hoped for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oliveology absorbs into the skin and dries very quickly and splashing on water does not bring it out.  </li>
            <li>but this product Made shaving easy, no razor burn or cuts, leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Came by really quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super convenient since you can use it without water and rubbing the excess into your skin is like a bonus moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over four months now and all I can say is it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>I have used the whole gamut of men&#x27;s skin care products but have not found the kind of comfortable shaves this product provides.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on razor life, but there is some added life to each blade</li>
            <li>and I felt that fit into this criteria.</li>
            <li>it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the oil gets absorbed into your skin better or what, but</li>
            <li>and it you do get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>(it actually was moisturized and felt great).    </li>
            <li>They do have their own web site naturally, and there is more info about the shave gel on the site.</li>
            <li>So, Oliveology is my favorite thing in the bathroom right now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a close clean shave and my face hurts during</li>
            <li>I use a shave gel currently, Tend Skin Air, which is the best I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural product.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.  </li>
            <li>(I went through body soap extremely quickly, as well as body lotion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a very good lubricant, but too slick for me.</li>
            <li>It seemed very promising!</li>
            <li>and you can see where you are shaving a lot more clearly (hah!)</li>
            <li>and then I rinse off my face with warm water and apply another coat to shave against the grain to get as close of a shave as possible.  </li>
            <li>leaves skin supple and fresh my problem was that my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth it just for that reason.</li>
            <li>so it makes sense that you would want to have a shaving product with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its a nice concept but not a big deal, not a must buy.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is you can actually see where you are shaving (try that with a foam shaving product).  </li>
            <li>I love this so much because I can easily shave without having to wash my legs after when I&#x27;m in a quick hurry and its so moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>Super conflicting information on this thing first of all...</li>
            <li>I use several types of shaving creams, soaps, and oils and now this pretty amazing product from Oliveology.</li>
            <li>This can really allow you to have a really clean shave.</li>
            <li>I am on a quest to find the absolute best facial lubricant for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Being clear it is easy to see what you are doing.    </li>
            <li>but I found that if I need to shave my legs the next day and have tiny stubble, this works great.  </li>
            <li>After going both with and against the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of hair growth, any area shaved was left very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and the only problem I have is sometimes you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Most of commercial shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t provide protection against razor burn.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I did get razor burn.</li>
            <li>The first I shave with the grain</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would provide enough lubrication for a shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use as many organic products as possible.</li>
            <li>After the first shave, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first 8Oz bottle</li>
            <li>actually makes shaving enjoyable...</li>
            <li>Thanks Oliveology!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be more moisturizing, more natural, less perfumed, etc.  </li>
            <li>Now for the positive: It works.</li>
            <li>Not only did it help to minimize the razor burn on the back of my legs where it&#x27;s the most sensitive, but it also made for a very smooth shave all over my legs.</li>
            <li>It certainly was not what I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really lives up to its description.  </li>
            <li>However, in my desperation for a close, comfortable shave, I finally decided to give the oils a try.  </li>
            <li>You will need to \\&quot;keep track\\&quot; of where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t, as you cannot really see the gel once applied.  </li>
            <li>This is very convenient.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal...</li>
            <li>In the end, you use less product, and your face is super smooth.</li>
            <li>B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] is a pain to use with normal shave gels unless i use a large amount.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get a smooth shave with minimal fuss</li>
            <li>I tried the basic stuff from the drugstores and then moved on to simple hair conditioner and then to \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; soaps that you can wash your hair/body and shave with and now on to better stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s main.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and very lubricating.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t normally write reviews...</li>
            <li>The Oliveology Shave Gel is good but not great.</li>
            <li>Probably if you are looking for shaving gel/cream which should not leave dry skin or cause burning, not very expensive and also to be natural at the same time, you may not get anything better.</li>
            <li>i also like the fact there are more natural ingredients in this product compared to the typical shave gel/creme products...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap shave gels for 25+ years and always had problems with my face burning for hours on end after shaving in the morning (even with sharp razors).  </li>
            <li>The Oliveology Skin Care and Shave Gel is a new way to deal with shaving that leaves your face feeling refreshed and your skin not irritated.  </li>
            <li>With clear application I can see where I&#x27;m shaving!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the shave gel for about two weeks,and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>he has ever gotten from any shave product and no more complaining about pain:)  </li>
            <li>I usually use shaving gel and love it</li>
            <li>Although most other oils are also formulated with natural ingredients, I was especially intrigued that Oliveology was made from olive oil, a natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The price is right on target with other natural shave products, trust me, I&#x27;ve shaved with just about everything that is out there, from high end shave oils to that stuff that comes out of a can.</li>
            <li>I use a little bit of gel after the shower to add a bit more moisturizer to my face, though the web site states it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li>It seems as if the stuff drys a bit quick on your face so after you apply it and shave 1 cheek, the other cheek doesn&#x27;t feel as lubricated and almost starts to feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, so I have yet to see whether it really helps to extend the life of razors, which is why I had to give it a 4 for now.</li>
            <li>This product does not foam and is clear, therefore, when you put it on cover all areas to be shaved.  </li>
            <li>, it is clear and calming and allows you to see skin as you shave.  </li>
            <li>So far I have no problem with this products</li>
            <li>I felt that I got a close shave, my razor lasted longer, and I noticed that my hairs didn&#x27;t grow back as fast after a shave.</li>
            <li>(though none of the packaging did - now the sight says 100% natural &gt;.&lt;).</li>
            <li>The shave gel is unscented and contains what seems to be all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I shave with a merkur safety razor while showering and found out in the very beginning that water was not enough of a lubricant.</li>
            <li>no matter how much i used, it left my face on fire.</li>
            <li>but I believe it isn&#x27;t completely organic, so I switched to this shave gel.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>It beats any drugstore shave gel and leaves my skin so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin and have tried everything...</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find something natural and without coloring.  </li>
            <li>Went right back to the overly fruity-smelling lady-cream from Walmart for about a third</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like all the hormone changers in normal shave gel and stuff, and I can normally only use the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li>it is more expensive than what you would buy in the store but the benefits are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The key to oils giving a close, comfortable shave clearly lies in their lubrication properties, which is where conventional shaving creams fall short.</li>
            <li>I also felt that I needed to use a little more product than I expected, so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite sure that I would&#x27;ve went through at least one can of regular shaving cream by now.</li>
            <li>In recent decades I have used clear &amp; Aloe based shaving gels.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that on the actual bottle there is not one thing about natural or organic.     </li>
            <li>After, I learned that the secret is to really massage the oil onto you legs for a bit (like, 20-30 seconds) instead of just wiping it on quickly like you would with a cream.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li>Having used a wide variety of conventional shaving creams all my life, none of which ever offered me a comfortable shave and all of which always left my face irritated afterward, I eventually took notice of shaving oils that I had seen in several stores but never really paid much attention to.  </li>
            <li>My razor glided easily without me having to stop every few seconds to remove built up gel, unlike with other kinds.</li>
            <li>Left me painfree and left my skin soft from the olive oil...</li>
            <li>The price seemed a little high to me too, but so far I have discovered that a little bit really goes along way</li>
            <li>It lasts because you get results without a thick application and it seems to have a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Hair grows back faster because like another review said it doesn&#x27;t actually get down to the root it creates too large of a lubricated surface area.    </li>
            <li>The gel is not thick like some other shave gels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Way better compared to Gillette, Nivea&#x27;s of the world.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will serve me well for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of an oil that lubricates your face allowing the razor to slide easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oliveology for a few months now and can say that this is honestly the best shaving product I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
            <li> The shave gel allows the razor to glide smoothly over your face and makes the shaving experience a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and more moist than can aerosol type products</li>
            <li> I bought this for the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time for a good straight razor shave with a brush and soap or cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless, colorless, and not lathery to the point that you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing (it doesn&#x27;t lather at all unless you REALLY work it up anyways, so that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li> Has left me with a good experience-!</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor blade sharp, holds a close shave, no razor bumps, no cuts, and best of all</li>
            <li> I would easily give it 5 stars if the formula was thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all sticky in any way and can easily be rinsed from you razor blade and your skin.</li>
            <li> and I needed to get to the sink to clean off my razor which took more time and effort than I hoped for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oliveology absorbs into the skin and dries very quickly and splashing on water does not bring it out.  </li>
            <li> but this product Made shaving easy, no razor burn or cuts, leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Came by really quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super convenient since you can use it without water and rubbing the excess into your skin is like a bonus moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over four months now and all I can say is it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> I have used the whole gamut of men&#x27;s skin care products but have not found the kind of comfortable shaves this product provides.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on razor life, but there is some added life to each blade</li>
            <li> and I felt that fit into this criteria.</li>
            <li> it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the oil gets absorbed into your skin better or what, but</li>
            <li> and it you do get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> (it actually was moisturized and felt great).    </li>
            <li> They do have their own web site naturally, and there is more info about the shave gel on the site.</li>
            <li> So, Oliveology is my favorite thing in the bathroom right now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a close clean shave and my face hurts during</li>
            <li> I use a shave gel currently, Tend Skin Air, which is the best I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> Nice natural product.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.  </li>
            <li> (I went through body soap extremely quickly, as well as body lotion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a very good lubricant, but too slick for me.</li>
            <li> It seemed very promising!</li>
            <li> and you can see where you are shaving a lot more clearly (hah!)</li>
            <li> and then I rinse off my face with warm water and apply another coat to shave against the grain to get as close of a shave as possible.  </li>
            <li> leaves skin supple and fresh my problem was that my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth it just for that reason.</li>
            <li> so it makes sense that you would want to have a shaving product with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Its a nice concept but not a big deal, not a must buy.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice is you can actually see where you are shaving (try that with a foam shaving product).  </li>
            <li> I love this so much because I can easily shave without having to wash my legs after when I&#x27;m in a quick hurry and its so moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> Super conflicting information on this thing first of all...</li>
            <li> I use several types of shaving creams, soaps, and oils and now this pretty amazing product from Oliveology.</li>
            <li> This can really allow you to have a really clean shave.</li>
            <li> I am on a quest to find the absolute best facial lubricant for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Being clear it is easy to see what you are doing.    </li>
            <li> but I found that if I need to shave my legs the next day and have tiny stubble, this works great.  </li>
            <li> After going both with and against the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of hair growth, any area shaved was left very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and the only problem I have is sometimes you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Most of commercial shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t provide protection against razor burn.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I did get razor burn.</li>
            <li> The first I shave with the grain</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would provide enough lubrication for a shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use as many organic products as possible.</li>
            <li> After the first shave, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first 8Oz bottle</li>
            <li> actually makes shaving enjoyable...</li>
            <li> Thanks Oliveology!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be more moisturizing, more natural, less perfumed, etc.  </li>
            <li> Now for the positive: It works.</li>
            <li> Not only did it help to minimize the razor burn on the back of my legs where it&#x27;s the most sensitive, but it also made for a very smooth shave all over my legs.</li>
            <li> It certainly was not what I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really lives up to its description.  </li>
            <li> However, in my desperation for a close, comfortable shave, I finally decided to give the oils a try.  </li>
            <li> You will need to \\&quot;keep track\\&quot; of where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t, as you cannot really see the gel once applied.  </li>
            <li> This is very convenient.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal...</li>
            <li> In the end, you use less product, and your face is super smooth.</li>
            <li> B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] is a pain to use with normal shave gels unless i use a large amount.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get a smooth shave with minimal fuss</li>
            <li> I tried the basic stuff from the drugstores and then moved on to simple hair conditioner and then to \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; soaps that you can wash your hair/body and shave with and now on to better stuff.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s main.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and very lubricating.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally write reviews...</li>
            <li> The Oliveology Shave Gel is good but not great.</li>
            <li> Probably if you are looking for shaving gel/cream which should not leave dry skin or cause burning, not very expensive and also to be natural at the same time, you may not get anything better.</li>
            <li> i also like the fact there are more natural ingredients in this product compared to the typical shave gel/creme products...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap shave gels for 25+ years and always had problems with my face burning for hours on end after shaving in the morning (even with sharp razors).  </li>
            <li> The Oliveology Skin Care and Shave Gel is a new way to deal with shaving that leaves your face feeling refreshed and your skin not irritated.  </li>
            <li> With clear application I can see where I&#x27;m shaving!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shave gel for about two weeks,and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> he has ever gotten from any shave product and no more complaining about pain:)  </li>
            <li> I usually use shaving gel and love it</li>
            <li> Although most other oils are also formulated with natural ingredients, I was especially intrigued that Oliveology was made from olive oil, a natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The price is right on target with other natural shave products, trust me, I&#x27;ve shaved with just about everything that is out there, from high end shave oils to that stuff that comes out of a can.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of gel after the shower to add a bit more moisturizer to my face, though the web site states it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the stuff drys a bit quick on your face so after you apply it and shave 1 cheek, the other cheek doesn&#x27;t feel as lubricated and almost starts to feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it is clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, so I have yet to see whether it really helps to extend the life of razors, which is why I had to give it a 4 for now.</li>
            <li> This product does not foam and is clear, therefore, when you put it on cover all areas to be shaved.  </li>
            <li> , it is clear and calming and allows you to see skin as you shave.  </li>
            <li> So far I have no problem with this products</li>
            <li> I felt that I got a close shave, my razor lasted longer, and I noticed that my hairs didn&#x27;t grow back as fast after a shave.</li>
            <li> (though none of the packaging did - now the sight says 100% natural &gt;.&lt;).</li>
            <li> The shave gel is unscented and contains what seems to be all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I shave with a merkur safety razor while showering and found out in the very beginning that water was not enough of a lubricant.</li>
            <li> no matter how much i used, it left my face on fire.</li>
            <li> but I believe it isn&#x27;t completely organic, so I switched to this shave gel.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> It beats any drugstore shave gel and leaves my skin so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin and have tried everything...</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find something natural and without coloring.  </li>
            <li> Went right back to the overly fruity-smelling lady-cream from Walmart for about a third</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like all the hormone changers in normal shave gel and stuff, and I can normally only use the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li> it is more expensive than what you would buy in the store but the benefits are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The key to oils giving a close, comfortable shave clearly lies in their lubrication properties, which is where conventional shaving creams fall short.</li>
            <li> I also felt that I needed to use a little more product than I expected, so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite sure that I would&#x27;ve went through at least one can of regular shaving cream by now.</li>
            <li> In recent decades I have used clear &amp; Aloe based shaving gels.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that on the actual bottle there is not one thing about natural or organic.     </li>
            <li> After, I learned that the secret is to really massage the oil onto you legs for a bit (like, 20-30 seconds) instead of just wiping it on quickly like you would with a cream.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Having used a wide variety of conventional shaving creams all my life, none of which ever offered me a comfortable shave and all of which always left my face irritated afterward, I eventually took notice of shaving oils that I had seen in several stores but never really paid much attention to.  </li>
            <li> My razor glided easily without me having to stop every few seconds to remove built up gel, unlike with other kinds.</li>
            <li> Left me painfree and left my skin soft from the olive oil...</li>
            <li> The price seemed a little high to me too, but so far I have discovered that a little bit really goes along way</li>
            <li> It lasts because you get results without a thick application and it seems to have a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> Hair grows back faster because like another review said it doesn&#x27;t actually get down to the root it creates too large of a lubricated surface area.    </li>
            <li> The gel is not thick like some other shave gels.</li>
            <li> Compared to my usual shaving cream, it was runny, hard to use because you can&#x27;t see where you have already applied it, and left me more prone to razor burn, not to mention the enormous difference in price.  </li>
            <li> Very lubricating and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount per shave, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this would last</li>
            <li> It might work for people with finer, less sensitive skin, but if your skin/hair is anything like mine, I&#x27;d recommend staying away.</li>
            <li> It lubricates the skin well, keeping a DE blade from cutting me or creating irritation which many brushless products do not.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have to shave in a hurry (as in, wake up 20 minutes late for work, have to shave fast)</li>
            <li> Part of the reason I always overlooked them was because they seemed almost absurdly expensive, typically five dollars or more for a half-ounce bottle, depending on the brand.  </li>
            <li> If I shave without a moisturizing shaving cream, I inevitably end up with little red bumps all over my legs.</li>
            <li> I then started researching different brands on the internet to see what other people had to say about shaving oils</li>
            <li> Am looking forward to seeing how it does with the dry winter weather coming up.</li>
            <li> It got the job done, but my legs were always so dry, so I had to buy lotion to apply after the shower.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, forget this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of shaving gel, but a lot of them caused razor burn... oddly enough.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I have thick, coarse hair and somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Technically I can shave with this stuff although I feel like the razor is pulling the hair out instead of cutting it clean when the razor glides across my face.  </li>
            <li> Simply wet your face, apply a little bit of the Oliveology gel, and shave with a regular razor (mach 3, turbo, etc).  </li>
            <li> I would practically need a wet towel to wipe off hairs thoroughly</li>
            <li> Just a few dabs on your face makes the razor glide across your beard with total ease, no hair-pull and no razor burn.    </li>
            <li> after I shave I just use a wet razor with no gel to get everything.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter, and shaving makes my legs extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it just by itself and other times I prefer to use it with my other aloe shave gels.</li>
            <li> However, it makes up for it in other ways.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see it in a different container that would help you to dole out a small amount easier...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face or other... areas..     </li>
            <li> I shave my face every couple days, and other parts once a week.</li>
            <li> and I shave about every other day, and I also shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> No stubble after 3 days, and with soap and other products I have to shave again after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I stop using other brand of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> However the gel delivers in every other aspect.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t sticky (doesn&#x27;t cut down on the life of the razor).</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it again since the price and wait for shipment is not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the hair growth came back quicker than it usually does, probably due to not getting a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I typically use Proraso shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Woe is me - I got a most horrific razor burn from stem to stern, which I&#x27;m still trying to heal from about a month later.  </li>
            <li> This slows down the process a little.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s lathers little, because it is not ideal shaving gel, (you should used to it), but That&#x27;s the Natural one</li>
            <li> There were certainly less bumps, but my legs were not smooth.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends not rinsing your face afterwards since it acts as a moisturizer, but I find that I have to rinse or wipe at least a little because of the small hairs left on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, my skin gets dried out way less, and I think it even moisturizes a little.  </li>
            <li> And, on a per-ounce basis, it was far less expensive than competing oils.  </li>
            <li> Even for tough part of your stubble, a little 5 second massage of the product can do wonders to soften it up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver with a heavy beard</li>
            <li> Since using Oliveology, I&#x27;ve found that I shave less and no longer have any ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li> Never knew shaving could be such an unpleasant experience, otherwise I would have born as a female!</li>
            <li> As long as I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I hate shaving mainly because of the burning feeling and the dry skin which I get after the shave.</li>
            <li> I also have to use very little.  </li>
            <li> An additional trick I learned is to store your razor in a small drinking glass with the head submerged in Oliveology.  </li>
            <li> I usually need at least 2 application per shave.</li>
            <li> A little of the product does go a long way, but I&#x27;m afraid it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Proraso in my experience is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> Although it has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t foam, and can be a little thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise anyone who&#x27;s still on the fence to give it at least a trial run on the 2oz and see how they like it.</li>
            <li> he has never liked to shave cause</li>
            <li> than with a thick lather.</li>
            <li> But if I have a thick beard (unshaven for a couple of days)</li>
            <li> i mean...</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and anything i use on my legs drys my legs out horribly</li>
            <li> Not great, but it works.</li>
            <li> One of the worse product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Negative!!</li>
            <li> It was a very uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It was also slightly painful going over the front of my legs.</li>
            <li> he always said it was painful.  </li>
            <li> I hate non foaming shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Just Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product. I bought it because I am trying to put as minimal ingredients and all natural products onto my body as possible and I felt that fit into this criteria. It is a very good lubricant, but too slick for me. I would easily give it 5 stars if the formula was thicker.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally write reviews...but this product Made shaving easy, no razor burn or cuts, leaves skin smooth. So far I have no problem with this products and I recommend people to try this product.</li>
            <li> The Oliveology Skin Care and Shave Gel is a new way to deal with shaving that leaves your face feeling refreshed and your skin not irritated.  The shave gel allows the razor to glide smoothly over your face and makes the shaving experience a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came by really quickly! I shared it to my roommate loved it! now we&#x27;re sharing this but I&#x27;ll be rushing her to get one herself soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with razor bumps and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed. Not only did it help to minimize the razor burn on the back of my legs where it&#x27;s the most sensitive, but it also made for a very smooth shave all over my legs. It also does a great job keeping my legs moisturized. Am looking forward to seeing how it does with the dry winter weather coming up.</li>
            <li> This product works better than I anticipated. It is especially useful since it is transparent and you can see where you are shaving a lot more clearly (hah!) than with a thick lather. My wife has confiscated my bottle so I will have to order more.</li>
            <li> my husband love this product. His face doesn&#x27;t need lotion after shaves. only problem  is you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of shaving gel, but a lot of them caused razor burn... oddly enough. So, I was just using body soap for a while. It got the job done, but my legs were always so dry, so I had to buy lotion to apply after the shower. Doing that a few years burning a whole through my wallet. (I went through body soap extremely quickly, as well as body lotion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Oliveology a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic! I don&#x27;t need to lotion my legs anymore, and my razors last longer, like the product says. So, Oliveology is my favorite thing in the bathroom right now.</li>
            <li> In recent decades I have used clear &amp; Aloe based shaving gels. Most of commercial shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t provide protection against razor burn. I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try and I&#x27;m Very pleased with this product. Sometimes I use it just by itself and other times I prefer to use it with my other aloe shave gels. I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really lives up to its description.  My face almost doesn&#x27;t need lotion after I shave it is so smooth.  I also have to use very little.  Being clear it is easy to see what you are doing.    I highly recommend it.  It doesn&#x27;t have any odor which some people might not like, but that gives you the opportunity to use any aftershave you like without a competing aroma.</li>
            <li> I give this only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give QUITE as close a shave as a regular gel. However, it makes up for it in other ways.  I have very dry skin in the winter, and shaving makes my legs extremely itchy. With this stuff, my skin gets dried out way less, and I think it even moisturizes a little.  You only need a tiny amount per shave, so the bottle lasts a long time. I would like to see it in a different container that would help you to dole out a small amount easier...maybe a pump?  The first time I used this, I did get razor burn. After, I learned that the secret is to really massage the oil onto you legs for a bit (like, 20-30 seconds) instead of just wiping it on quickly like you would with a cream. I don&#x27;t know if the oil gets absorbed into your skin better or what, but taking your time applying this stuff is the key.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I felt that I got a close shave, my razor lasted longer, and I noticed that my hairs didn&#x27;t grow back as fast after a shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time for a good straight razor shave with a brush and soap or cream.  I have been very impressed with the results.  It lubricates the skin well, keeping a DE blade from cutting me or creating irritation which many brushless products do not.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is totally colorless and I can&#x27;t see where I have shaved and where I have not.  This slows down the process a little.  Other than that, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Technically I can shave with this stuff although I feel like the razor is pulling the hair out instead of cutting it clean when the razor glides across my face.  I don&#x27;t get a close clean shave and my face hurts during and after I use it.    I use a Shick Quadro razor.  I am going to test out using a double-edge saftey razor to see if it is any different.  For now this only gets 2 stars and I will not be using the rest of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Super conflicting information on this thing first of all... Parts of the site said 100% organic when I bought it (though none of the packaging did - now the sight says 100% natural &gt;.&lt;). I can tell you that on the actual bottle there is not one thing about natural or organic.     Now for the positive: It works. Not great, but it works. I don&#x27;t like all the hormone changers in normal shave gel and stuff, and I can normally only use the sensitive ones. I don&#x27;t get bumps with this and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face or other... areas..     Negative!!: It only just works. Hair grows back faster because like another review said it doesn&#x27;t actually get down to the root it creates too large of a lubricated surface area.    All that being said I&#x27;ve had this for 7 months. I shave my face every couple days, and other parts once a week. I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle yet. So it&#x27;s looking like a 12$/year cost... THAT is awesome!</li>
            <li> I did not like at all. One of the worse product I have ever used. I hate non foaming shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Nice natural product. Works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t cause bumps or   irritation. Silky smooth and more moist than can aerosol type products</li>
            <li> If your looking for a shave product that does what it says in it&#x27;s product description, than you, like I, have found that shave product. I&#x27;ve used the shave gel for about two weeks,and all I can say is WOW! I can say that I have truly put this stuff to the test. I&#x27;m a head shaver with a heavy beard and I shave about every other day, and I also shave in the shower. There wasn&#x27;t any problem with the gel running into my eyes. The gel is not thick like some other shave gels. It kind of has the consistency of aloe vera gel. It&#x27;s not at all sticky in any way and can easily be rinsed from you razor blade and your skin. I use a little bit of gel after the shower to add a bit more moisturizer to my face, though the web site states it&#x27;s not necessary. The shave gel is unscented and contains what seems to be all natural ingredients. They do have their own web site naturally, and there is more info about the shave gel on the site. The price is right on target with other natural shave products, trust me, I&#x27;ve shaved with just about everything that is out there, from high end shave oils to that stuff that comes out of a can. This shave gel is great, and a great value for your money!</li>
            <li> I am on a quest to find the absolute best facial lubricant for wet shaving. I shave with a merkur safety razor while showering and found out in the very beginning that water was not enough of a lubricant. That&#x27;s when I went looking for the best shaving cream/gel. I tried the basic stuff from the drugstores and then moved on to simple hair conditioner and then to \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; soaps that you can wash your hair/body and shave with and now on to better stuff.  The Oliveology Shave Gel is good but not great. I usually need at least 2 application per shave. The first I shave with the grain and then I rinse off my face with warm water and apply another coat to shave against the grain to get as close of a shave as possible.  Applying the 2nd coat does not burn but it is an annoyance to need two coats.  It seems as if the stuff drys a bit quick on your face so after you apply it and shave 1 cheek, the other cheek doesn&#x27;t feel as lubricated and almost starts to feel sticky.  Surprisingly, the best stuff I&#x27;ve shaved with is one of the multi-use soaps that I won&#x27;t name for fear of being labeled a shill for the company.</li>
            <li> I would practically need a wet towel to wipe off hairs thoroughly and I needed to get to the sink to clean off my razor which took more time and effort than I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just convenient for an emergency situation where \\&quot;ya missed a spot\\&quot; and it you do get a smooth finish. I also felt that I needed to use a little more product than I expected, so I don&#x27;t know how long this would last or if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i purchased this and tried it out for two weeks maybe 3-4 shaves. now this didnt work for me gave me a lot of razor burns and bumps, no matter how much i used, it left my face on fire. i personally would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I have thick, coarse hair and somewhat sensitive skin. If I shave without a moisturizing shaving cream, I inevitably end up with little red bumps all over my legs. This product is of a medium consistency, leaning toward the liquidy side. It&#x27;s clear, odorless, and very lubricating. It seemed very promising! However, when I tried shaving I did not get a close shave at all. There were certainly less bumps, but my legs were not smooth. It was also slightly painful going over the front of my legs. To make matters worse, the hair growth came back quicker than it usually does, probably due to not getting a close enough shave. I had the same experience with my underarms. A little of the product does go a long way, but I&#x27;m afraid it just didn&#x27;t work well for me. It might work for people with finer, less sensitive skin, but if your skin/hair is anything like mine, I&#x27;d recommend staying away.</li>
            <li> I was pleased most by the amount of gel I needed to apply. Per shave, I used a tiny fraction of the bottle because of the viscosity of the gel. It was odorless and I could see where I was shaving. After going both with and against the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of hair growth, any area shaved was left very smooth. It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Tried as free sample from their FB page, and this gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve had zero ingrown hairs since using this, just as promised. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had. No stubble after 3 days, and with soap and other products I have to shave again after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I use several types of shaving creams, soaps, and oils and now this pretty amazing product from Oliveology. Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get a smooth shave with minimal fuss &#x27;n muss plus I feel great afterwards, without any razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have used the whole gamut of men&#x27;s skin care products but have not found the kind of comfortable shaves this product provides. leaves skin supple and fresh my problem was that my [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] is a pain to use with normal shave gels unless i use a large amount. a quarter size of this gel on each cheek does beautifully</li>
            <li> I like it.  What is very nice is I don&#x27;t need to use an aftershave.  I typically use Proraso shaving cream.  Proraso in my experience is hard to beat.  I don&#x27;t mind using this stuff though.  However, if you have to shave in a hurry (as in, wake up 20 minutes late for work, have to shave fast) I don&#x27;t recommend this.  It was a very uncomfortable shave.  Overall, good product.  After a shower it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would provide enough lubrication for a shave but it does indeed. The price seemed a little high to me too, but so far I have discovered that a little bit really goes along way so that makes up for it. The manufacturer recommends not rinsing your face afterwards since it acts as a moisturizer, but I find that I have to rinse or wipe at least a little because of the small hairs left on my face after shaving. I also like that it is clear. You can see what areas you have and haven&#x27;t shaved. My face never felt so good. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use as many organic products as possible. I used the Alba shave cream but I believe it isn&#x27;t completely organic, so I switched to this shave gel. I like it so far. A little goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t sticky (doesn&#x27;t cut down on the life of the razor).</li>
            <li> Oliveology is better than any shave gel I&#x27;ve tried before. It&#x27;s odorless, colorless, and not lathery to the point that you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing (it doesn&#x27;t lather at all unless you REALLY work it up anyways, so that&#x27;s good). My razor glided easily without me having to stop every few seconds to remove built up gel, unlike with other kinds. I&#x27;d advise anyone who&#x27;s still on the fence to give it at least a trial run on the 2oz and see how they like it. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, so I have yet to see whether it really helps to extend the life of razors, which is why I had to give it a 4 for now. I may make an addendum to add or remove a star based upon the final output of the razor lifespan.     Kudos to Oliveology for making such a great shaving product!</li>
            <li> Very good product for those who like Natural production, it&#x27;s lathers little, because it is not ideal shaving gel, (you should used to it), but That&#x27;s the Natural one and it&#x27;s main.</li>
            <li> Having used a wide variety of conventional shaving creams all my life, none of which ever offered me a comfortable shave and all of which always left my face irritated afterward, I eventually took notice of shaving oils that I had seen in several stores but never really paid much attention to.  Part of the reason I always overlooked them was because they seemed almost absurdly expensive, typically five dollars or more for a half-ounce bottle, depending on the brand.  Even factoring in that you use only several drops per shave, the oils still seemed considerably more expensive than shaving cream.  However, in my desperation for a close, comfortable shave, I finally decided to give the oils a try.  In short, I was amazed at the results.  I then started researching different brands on the internet to see what other people had to say about shaving oils and if there were any brands that were preferred over others.   And that&#x27;s how I learned about Oliveology.     Although most other oils are also formulated with natural ingredients, I was especially intrigued that Oliveology was made from olive oil, a natural moisturizer.  And, on a per-ounce basis, it was far less expensive than competing oils.  After the first shave, I was sold.  The key to oils giving a close, comfortable shave clearly lies in their lubrication properties, which is where conventional shaving creams fall short. And in my opinion, Oliveology stood apart from the rest of the oils I tried.  Just a few dabs on your face makes the razor glide across your beard with total ease, no hair-pull and no razor burn.    An additional trick I learned is to store your razor in a small drinking glass with the head submerged in Oliveology.  Not only will this further enhance your shaves, but it will extend the life of the blade and lubricating strip by inhibiting rust and mineral build-up.  After using Oliveology, I no longer dread the daily ritual of shaving and will never go back to using shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Although it has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t foam, and can be a little thin, this is my shave gel of choice.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year, and have recommended it to many people.  Simply wet your face, apply a little bit of the Oliveology gel, and shave with a regular razor (mach 3, turbo, etc).  You will need to \\&quot;keep track\\&quot; of where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t, as you cannot really see the gel once applied.  Sometimes, I will wash my face off and do a 2nd application and shave, but that is not always necessary.  In the end, you use less product, and your face is super smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have sensitive skin. This can really allow you to have a really clean shave. I stop using other brand of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over four months now and all I can say is it&#x27;s excellent. I&#x27;m still on my first 8Oz bottle and I&#x27;m quite sure that I would&#x27;ve went through at least one can of regular shaving cream by now. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on razor life, but there is some added life to each blade so it&#x27;s definitely worth it just for that reason.</li>
            <li> This shave gel in just great! I have very dry and sensitive skin and anything i use on my legs drys my legs out horribly so when i heard of this i just had to try it. It is everything they say it is!  Plus they have great sales from time to time. It is a must in my shower!  Plus my husband shaves his head and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> Bought it because as a lifestyle Im trying to lessen my carbon footprint as well as use healthier organic products when it comes to skin care. Oliveology is a wonderful gel that is worth the price. Smells great and is gentle on the skin leaving you moisturised after a shave. The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars is because I cant get close shaves with this gel, so after I shave I just use a wet razor with no gel to get everything. Adds an extra 30 seconds, not a big deal or added hassle. However the gel delivers in every other aspect. Also the seller is great and I had no issues with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oliveology for a few months now and can say that this is honestly the best shaving product I&#x27;ve EVER used.  It beats any drugstore shave gel and leaves my skin so incredibly soft.  Since using Oliveology, I&#x27;ve found that I shave less and no longer have any ingrown hairs!  It&#x27;s super convenient since you can use it without water and rubbing the excess into your skin is like a bonus moisturizer! Definitely recommending this product to all the women (and men!) I know.</li>
            <li> my husband mentioned that he was out of shaving creme so instead of heading to the store i thought i would try to find something on amazon when i found this incredible product!  he has never liked to shave cause he always said it was painful.  it is more expensive than what you would buy in the store but the benefits are well worth the extra money. my husband now shaves on a regular basis and it is the closes shave he has ever gotten from any shave product and no more complaining about pain:)  i also like the fact there are more natural ingredients in this product compared to the typical shave gel/creme products... i mean... the pores are opened up with shaving occurs so it makes sense that you would want to have a shaving product with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this so much because I can easily shave without having to wash my legs after when I&#x27;m in a quick hurry and its so moisturizing at the same time. This is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and the only problem I have is sometimes you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This stuff is different than traditional foam creams.  It&#x27;s more of an oil that lubricates your face allowing the razor to slide easily.  Plus, it seems that when hair grows back it a bit finer than it was, though that effect ends when you stop using the Oliveology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oliveology for over a year now and it&#x27;s incredible!!! I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin and have tried everything...Electric, blade, cream, lotion, potion...This stuff is the real deal...actually makes shaving enjoyable...doesn&#x27;t smell, feels amazing, and you don&#x27;t even need aftershave...Just Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> Dont think twice. It is awesome. Even for tough part of your stubble, a little 5 second massage of the product can do wonders to soften it up.  Way better compared to Gillette, Nivea&#x27;s of the world.</li>
            <li> With clear application I can see where I&#x27;m shaving! Left me painfree and left my skin soft from the olive oil...&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t need to apply lotion or anything. Has left me with a good experience-! Good thing I bought the 8 ounce bottle!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving gel do to its reviews on youtube. I thought it was a great find. However, I am not sold on it yet. Its nothing too amazing over the vegan products that I had used before for shaving. Its a nice concept but not a big deal, not a must buy. If your using inappropriate shaving substances such as, a bar of soap - I would say give this a try it will give you a cleaner and smoother shave. I would not purchase it again since the price and wait for shipment is not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> good piece I love work perfect</li>
            <li> An absolutely great product! I&#x27;ve used cheap shave gels for 25+ years and always had problems with my face burning for hours on end after shaving in the morning (even with sharp razors).  This product does not foam and is clear, therefore, when you put it on cover all areas to be shaved.  What&#x27;s nice is you can actually see where you are shaving (try that with a foam shaving product).  There&#x27;s no pulling/razor burn after using this product.  I was amazed after the 1st time using it that I didn&#x27;t have my face burning for hours on end (it actually was moisturized and felt great).    I will definitely buy this product again when I run out and will be trying it with a safety razor for even smoother shaves.  Thanks Oliveology!</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would buy again.  Compared to my usual shaving cream, it was runny, hard to use because you can&#x27;t see where you have already applied it, and left me more prone to razor burn, not to mention the enormous difference in price.  At the end I concluded that this is one of those areas where I just can&#x27;t go organic.  Now I am happily back to my drug store shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I usually use shaving gel and love it but I found that if I need to shave my legs the next day and have tiny stubble, this works great.  Very lubricating and a little goes a long way.  I only need a dime size amount to do an entire leg.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving mainly because of the burning feeling and the dry skin which I get after the shave. So I bought this with the hope that this would solve all my problems.As long as I have thin hair I have no problems. It gives me a good shave but not a close shave. But if I have a thick beard (unshaven for a couple of days) then I cannot use this at all. On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t give the burning sensation or dryness after the shave. Probably if you are looking for shaving gel/cream which should not leave dry skin or cause burning, not very expensive and also to be natural at the same time, you may not get anything better. Never knew shaving could be such an unpleasant experience, otherwise I would have born as a female!</li>
            <li> I use a shave gel currently, Tend Skin Air, which is the best I have found so far.  I was hoping to find something natural and without coloring.  If you have dry skin, forget this one.  Oliveology absorbs into the skin and dries very quickly and splashing on water does not bring it out.  You have to use quite a lot and the glide isn&#x27;t as nearly as good as Tend Skin Air.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Great! Love it. This is exactly what I was looking for. I am sure it will serve me well for many years.</li>
            <li> Are you supposed to use this WITH shaving cream? If so, I totally didn&#x27;t get that and purchased this to REPLACE shaving cream.  I thought it&#x27;d be more moisturizing, more natural, less perfumed, etc.  Woe is me - I got a most horrific razor burn from stem to stern, which I&#x27;m still trying to heal from about a month later.  Went right back to the overly fruity-smelling lady-cream from Walmart for about a third the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: this may not be what you expect.  It certainly was not what I anticipated.  My boyfriend also tried it on his beard and got similarly dismal results, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> This product does everything that was advertised in the commercials starring Toby Turner.  Keeps my razor blade sharp, holds a close shave, no razor bumps, no cuts, and best of all hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Great shave for  easily irritated skin, it is clear and calming and allows you to see skin as you shave.  It lasts because you get results without a thick application and it seems to have a mild scent.  It can be used under a cream for extra layer of protection.</li>
