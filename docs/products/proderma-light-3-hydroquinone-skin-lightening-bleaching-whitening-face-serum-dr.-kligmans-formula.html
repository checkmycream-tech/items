            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my face</li>
            <li>be sure to use sunscreen and avoid cocoa butter, it will make it darker!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective product for OTC.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled but will comment more in another week.  </li>
            <li>The huge patch on my forehead is 80% gone!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many bleaching creams and not one has been able to lighten my sun spots like this product.  </li>
            <li>I am sure to get.</li>
            <li>I have tried many rated products but no one will even come to close to this product.</li>
            <li>I love it that I will be buying more of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I think this product isn&#x27;t really for my kind because it did not lighten nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Light 3% Hydroquinone Skin Lightening Bleaching Whitening Face Serum Dr. Kligman&#x27;s Formula]]</li>
            <li>I think this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with the ProDerma Light formula, perhaps because it contains a mild corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and irritation.</li>
            <li>I used a good scrub on it and after a short time it went away.</li>
            <li>I have been good about using a moisturizer at night under my eyes and I have been mixing my moisturizer with a little water and vasiline duing the day just for under my eyes to make sure the area is protected .  </li>
            <li>The 3% Hydroquinone was the right choice</li>
            <li>My skin tone is so much more even, my spotty &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; (cause its more than a little spot) have greatly faded and my dark eye circles are almost gone!</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>It also stings a bit when I first appply the product.  </li>
            <li>I have just started bottle # 2 and am starting to see results good enough that I have ordered bottle # 3.</li>
            <li>Actually thank God for this product, I started becoming a recluse</li>
            <li>and I have to use it one day on and one day off, and I see my spots returning in certain areas.</li>
            <li>But, with single daily application (more practical than more frequent application recommended) it did diminish hyperpigmentation areas on the face.</li>
            <li>Leave a bit of moisture on your face/neck (or use wet fingers) to give it more &#x27;slip&#x27; when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was very scared at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking about how much of a mistake this was and I was worried I was going to have to see a dermatologist since I made the problem much</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle of Proderma Light, I have my friends using it as well.</li>
            <li>The seller is speedy at mailing it out, so you will get the product fast.</li>
            <li>and I am very fair-skinned.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this for those stubborn spots.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said i must be doing very well at staying out of the sun.</li>
            <li>Intend on purchasing more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I have average skin but many products</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what happened with this new formula that is not creamy as before with the minty aroma that it used to have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I noticed the change immediately, but now, I can see that this new formula is peeling my face</li>
            <li>I just ordered a new bottle of this product.</li>
            <li>Triluma is too expensive for me to use regularly, so I think the best regimen will be to use ProDerma two times daily and Triluma as a spot/as needed treatment.</li>
            <li>I also add Retin A every other day to help it absorb more and am a faithful twice a day clarion facial brush user.  </li>
            <li>so we stop but after 5 days or so, the reddish skin start peeling and a new clear skin was quite visible.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream to treat facial dark spots and we have tried many before with no results.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use I am starting to see the large brown spot on my face start to fade.  </li>
            <li>and I look completely even toned again.</li>
            <li>This product how ever, surprised me.</li>
            <li>and I am a pale freckled person (though you see the freckles primarily in the summer).  </li>
            <li>Only half of that was true for me.</li>
            <li>still have a few stubborn spots and some past acne scars I am going to be concentrating on,  but, this stuff has been amazing,  </li>
            <li>This product has made my skin smooth and is SLOWLY lightening my spots.</li>
            <li>It definitely peeled my skin, and then new DARKER, larger scars grew in their place .</li>
            <li>I let some time lapse between my last order and this new one and some of the hyperpigmentation has come back.</li>
            <li>This time, I received a more liquify product (like water) with a strong perfume smell that is really annoying to use at night.  </li>
            <li>I had read previous customer reviews stating that it worked for them, and that it peeled the old damaged skin off, and new clear skin grew back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white 41 yr old female for complexion comparison,</li>
            <li>And even though I use Neutrogena 100 SPF sunblock everyday it would darken right back up when I went out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Used for about a month; dark splotches much lighter than before.  </li>
            <li>I am an african american 53yr old female, brown complexion with severe acne spots.  </li>
            <li>The dark skin got much darker (black almost) and very irritated.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have had to cake concealer and foundation over the scars everyday to hide them, until recently finding a different option that I should have done in the first place which is exfoliate every day, and use Maderma to fix the problem this product has caused.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have spent money on expensive products and yet this product, at it&#x27;s amazing affordable prize, did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>

            <li> I purchased this because I had a very dark hyperpigmentation on my upper lip</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a last alternative for the very dark sports I had on my face.</li>

            <li> Got absolutely no results from using this product.</li>

            <li> Not surprising since it contains not only 3 percent hydroquinone, which lightens skin, as well as Retin-A, which sloughs off old dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The skin was red underneath and in one small spot bled and is now healing.  </li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and it may NOT work for everyone, but it did for me.</li>
            <li> I tried other product on a darkened area on my face without any result.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything for over three years from a dermatologist who recommended sunscreen, to drug store remedies like Garnier dark spot remover, to costly department store brands like Clinique.  </li>
            <li> though it hurt I decided to use a makeup wipe to scrub the area and THE DARK AREA wiped away.  </li>
            <li> I want to say that the 1st bottle I used help tremendously on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> My stubborn dark spots are gone.  </li>

            <li> In just a week, it already cleared 75% of of the trouble spot</li>

            <li> I am 42 and the skin below my else has gotten very dark in the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I was caking on concealer and all that was doing was making my wrinkles (and there are not many) stand</li>
            <li> My skin peeled overnight and the spots have lightened over the past weeks.</li>
            <li> If there were negative stars I would have chosen that rating.</li>
            <li> the serum is a bit thick and so does not spread well.</li>

            <li> that looked horrible and was very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It became dark reddish and a bit painful (burning sensation) and we got concerned</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> yes i got this product for lightening the discolorations on my face. I&#x27;m a dark skin african american and I think this product isn&#x27;t really for my kind because it did not lighten nothing at all. Also I have only been using it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product for OTC. I have sunspots that have responded only to the RX Triluma. This product has made my skin smooth and is SLOWLY lightening my spots. Triluma is too expensive for me to use regularly, so I think the best regimen will be to use ProDerma two times daily and Triluma as a spot/as needed treatment. Give this product a chance though. I have just started bottle # 2 and am starting to see results good enough that I have ordered bottle # 3. TIP: the serum is a bit thick and so does not spread well. Leave a bit of moisture on your face/neck (or use wet fingers) to give it more &#x27;slip&#x27; when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 3 bottles/ 2x daily use: I have continued to see improvement in my skin and dark spots are signifigantly fading. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I have tried many bleaching creams and not one has been able to lighten my sun spots like this product.  I have spent money on expensive products and yet this product, at it&#x27;s amazing affordable prize, did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008EDRWOW ProDerma Light 3% Hydroquinone Skin Lightening Bleaching Whitening Face Serum Dr. Kligman&#x27;s Formula]]</li>
            <li> I use the product only once a day, so perhaps my results are slower.  Still, I can see the skin lightening day by day.  I appreciate that the cream is non-irritating.  I have average skin but many products cause redness.  This does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the product had come with a pamphlet, showing photos of the skin changes that can be expected, and including a Q&amp;A section.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had a very dark hyperpigmentation on my upper lip (I am very Fair) that looked horrible and was very embarrassing. I tried everything for over three years from a dermatologist who recommended sunscreen, to drug store remedies like Garnier dark spot remover, to costly department store brands like Clinique.  They slowly lightened it a very small amount. And even though I use Neutrogena 100 SPF sunblock everyday it would darken right back up when I went out in the sun. Even if I kept my hand over my lip as much as possible. This ProDerma got rid of the dark spot in less than a month and I look completely even toned again. I was so happy that I purchased more and one for my mother who has age spots and she couldn&#x27;t believe how well it got rid of her age spots. The only down fall was it made the skin on my upper lip rough for a few weeks. I used a good scrub on it and after a short time it went away. I highly recommend this product. Actually thank God for this product, I started becoming a recluse and now I feel great again.</li>
            <li> I am actually really happy but I was very scared at the beginning.  I was only using it on a small area above and a bit in from my cheekbone and below my eye (but not close up to my eye at all).  I have very dark skin there and I am a pale freckled person (though you see the freckles primarily in the summer).  I am 42 and the skin below my else has gotten very dark in the past 2 years.  I was caking on concealer and all that was doing was making my wrinkles (and there are not many) stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream twice on day one and once on day 2.  The dark skin got much darker (black almost) and very irritated.  I was thinking about how much of a mistake this was and I was worried I was going to have to see a dermatologist since I made the problem much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it hurt I decided to use a makeup wipe to scrub the area and THE DARK AREA wiped away.  The skin was red underneath and in one small spot bled and is now healing.  It has only been a week.  I have been good about using a moisturizer at night under my eyes and I have been mixing my moisturizer with a little water and vasiline duing the day just for under my eyes to make sure the area is protected .  It has been a week.  I am thrilled but will comment more in another week.  I used the smallest amount of the cream and have a ton left. .....I will save it for the age spots I am sure to get.</li>
            <li> Athough I have not tried it yet (just arrived today)...I purchased this based on the advertised 3% hydro quinolone.  Nowhere on the bottle is it indicated this is in fact the percentage.  So....while this may work, not as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of Proderma Light, I have my friends using it as well. It does work wonders on sun spots. Highly recommend it. The seller is speedy at mailing it out, so you will get the product fast.</li>
            <li> Got absolutely no results from using this product. I would recommend PCA skin pigment gel, got great results from using it.</li>
            <li> If applied too liberally this does cause a localized irritation which lasts for about a day or so.  But, with single daily application (more practical than more frequent application recommended) it did diminish hyperpigmentation areas on the face.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  After two weeks of use I am starting to see the large brown spot on my face start to fade.  I hope it continues to fade it.  Burns skin sometimes though..</li>
            <li> Used for about a month; dark splotches much lighter than before.  Intend on purchasing more in the near future.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a last alternative for the very dark sports I had on my face. I have used Tri-Luma, Retin A, peelings, laser, Renova, etc., etc., etc. (you name it, I have used it) for this problem I have had for years.  Sadly, the formula for this product changed. This time, I received a more liquify product (like water) with a strong perfume smell that is really annoying to use at night.  I want to say that the 1st bottle I used help tremendously on my dark spots. I noticed the change immediately, but now, I can see that this new formula is peeling my face and I have to use it one day on and one day off, and I see my spots returning in certain areas. I really don&#x27;t know what happened with this new formula that is not creamy as before with the minty aroma that it used to have.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Vitamin C formula during the day time that this company also sells.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because  of the inconsistency of the formula&#x27;s preparation and the results I am getting now!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream to treat facial dark spots and we have tried many before with no results. This product how ever, surprised me. In just a week, it already cleared 75% of of the trouble spot and I think the reason for the other 25% not being cleared is because we stop using it after 4 days of twice daily application. It became dark reddish and a bit painful (burning sensation) and we got concerned so we stop but after 5 days or so, the reddish skin start peeling and a new clear skin was quite visible. I have tried many rated products but no one will even come to close to this product.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my face I love it that I will be buying more of this product.  Love it</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says it will do.  I am an african american 53yr old female, brown complexion with severe acne spots.  My skin peeled overnight and the spots have lightened over the past weeks. This product is amazing.  Will use this product faithfully.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference on my face after 3 weeks. It also stings a bit when I first appply the product.  I will use it until its gone but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> If there were negative stars I would have chosen that rating. I am a \\&quot;caramel complexion\\&quot;, African American female, that takes my appearance very seriously. I was hoping this product would solve the problem of my hyper pigmentation, as the product was designed to do. I had read previous customer reviews stating that it worked for them, and that it peeled the old damaged skin off, and new clear skin grew back. Only half of that was true for me. It definitely peeled my skin, and then new DARKER, larger scars grew in their place . Not only does this product not work... it made the ORIGINAL problem worse. Since using this product, I have had to cake concealer and foundation over the scars everyday to hide them, until recently finding a different option that I should have done in the first place which is exfoliate every day, and use Maderma to fix the problem this product has caused.&lt;br /&gt;I will be contacting the manufacturer shortly, but I do not blame the seller.&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar physical characteristics  as myself, do not use this product. My mistake shouldn&#x27;t be yours too.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new bottle of this product. It appears to be the only thing that works for me. Not surprising since it contains not only 3 percent hydroquinone, which lightens skin, as well as Retin-A, which sloughs off old dead skin cells. This is my 3rd bottle. I let some time lapse between my last order and this new one and some of the hyperpigmentation has come back. After putting this product on for a few  nights, you wake up in the morning with this glowing, luminescent skin. It also does not irritate my skin at all and I am very fair-skinned.  I tried the La-Roche Posay line and it made my face very red, irritated and itchy and one morning I found my eye had practically swelled shut. I have never had a problem with the ProDerma Light formula, perhaps because it contains a mild corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and irritation. I think this is a fabulous product. I have read the other reviews and it may NOT work for everyone, but it did for me.</li>
            <li> but I only used for under eye circles, they did lighten a little in some areas but other areas are now darker, I guess I have to wait for it to peel off.  be sure to use sunscreen and avoid cocoa butter, it will make it darker!</li>
            <li> After visiting a dematologist and learning the cost with laser remedies, I decided to give this a try while I saved up.....OMG!  I took pics before I started and again a month later.  My skin tone is so much more even, my spotty &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; (cause its more than a little spot) have greatly faded and my dark eye circles are almost gone! The huge patch on my forehead is 80% gone! still have a few stubborn spots and some past acne scars I am going to be concentrating on,  but, this stuff has been amazing,  I also add Retin A every other day to help it absorb more and am a faithful twice a day clarion facial brush user.  I think the facial brush has helped too.  I am ordering my second bottle and am a faithful customer.  Please wear sunscreen daily as you will burn and get spotty if u don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a white 41 yr old female for complexion comparison,</li>
            <li> I tried other product on a darkened area on my face without any result.  The 3% Hydroquinone was the right choice and I would purchase this again.  My stubborn dark spots are gone.  I really recommend this for those stubborn spots.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said i must be doing very well at staying out of the sun. My age spots have faded well; I recommend this product!</li>
