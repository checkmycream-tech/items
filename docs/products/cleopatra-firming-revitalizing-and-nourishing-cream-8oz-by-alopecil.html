            <li> what you would normally sweat, it dose not have any weird effect of burning your skin as ive heard other lotions may stain or burn your skin, i highly recommend it !!!</li>

            <li> &amp; i still don&#x27;t see a difference just less pain when i work my abs &amp; obliques.</li>

            <li> I would give this half a star if it let me i had to go to the doc an get cream for my rash.</li>
            <li> I began using this product a little before Christmas 2012</li>
            <li> I am not sure I believe that this product burns fat, but my some people swear that camphor does burn fat.</li>
            <li> and now what I have noticed during the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You have to work that body hard to make this work on you.</li>
            <li> needless to say it was a misacle worker</li>
            <li> and I got a rash all over my torso :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really makes you sweat.</li>
            <li> I put it on and wear my waist trainer over it. I sweat alot</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. My mother is Dominican and introduced me to it. I used the cream mostly around my belly and thighs while doing cardio workouts. I don&#x27;t really sweat during workouts but this will definitely help you sweat a lot. The camphor works with your body heat and makes your skin hot, therefore you sweat. It works even better with those sweat belts, or plastic jogging suits. I am not sure I believe that this product burns fat, but my some people swear that camphor does burn fat. My double chin is gone. So maybe it does work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try looking for this at a Beauty Supply shop in your nearest Hispanic neighborhood since it&#x27;s a Dominican product. It should cost about $7.</li>
            <li> I love it I use it to workout and I do sweat a lot more. Smells a bit like icy hot or bengay</li>
            <li> i use to use this product in dominican republic a lot i started using it in 2005 and would apply it before going on a walk or run.... needless to say it was a misacle worker is helps you sweat x3 what you would normally sweat, it dose not have any weird effect of burning your skin as ive heard other lotions may stain or burn your skin, i highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like icy hot. buy that since it&#x27;s cheaper. doesn&#x27;t make me sweat more &amp; i still don&#x27;t see a difference just less pain when i work my abs &amp; obliques.</li>
            <li> After one use, saw less cellulite. Feels incredible. It&#x27;s tingly and strong! Smells like vapor rub with cinnamon. However, it makes you sweat! Well worth the smell. You can feel it working almost immediately. Best used when you wrap with either neoprene workout wraps or just plain plastic wrap. Either way, will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Good cream i really like it it work perfectly good. I sugere more peaple buy it and try it n</li>
            <li> Did not see any results n smells awful</li>
            <li> It works !  Makes me sweat more, but of course is no miracle, nothing works if you eat more calories than you use.</li>
            <li> I bought the cream because I got excited with all the positive reviews I read, but sadly it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work - no sirve; we had very high expectations and did not work well. No adelgaza, hace sudar</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write a review, but I will on this product because many people in my book have been scammed by creams... All I can i can say is wow... I use this with a sweat belt and it definitely makes you sweat when you exercise. I do cardio every morning, changed my diet, and so forth therefore I cannot say it is a miracle cream that if you put it on you will drop inches... But I will tell you that it is definitely a tool to get you there. I rub the cream on, then I put the sweat belt over my skin and then I put a shirt on... I would suggest if you do it like that rinse your belt off daily as some people put the belt over there clothes... I find I sweat sooooo much more in that area by doing that way. Also another cool thing is that it has help with firming the skin on my abs which is great, so if your a mommy with flabby ab skin, I recommended it because it will help with that to.. Thanks Cleo!!!</li>
            <li> I love this it makes you lose pounds and makes you sweat WOW. You have to work that body hard to make this work on you.</li>
            <li> I began using this product a little before Christmas 2012 and I have seen the huge difference in my belly. I am not a big exercise person but I do like to walk and I apply the cream every morning and walk to my job. It is now January 2013 and many people have asked me what&#x27;s my secret! They can&#x27;t beleive that all I&#x27;m using is this cream; that&#x27;s how impacting the effect has been on me. I would get quite a few people asking me how many months pregnant I was prior to me using this.... Now all I get are stares because I look so good!! I still have some more fat to loose but the difference is a huge one. My pants and skirts fit me big now and I can&#x27;t wait to go shopping and see what size I am now!!! By the way, the cream only mad me sweat in the beginning when I first started using it and now what I have noticed during the past 2 weeks is that I use the bathroom 2 to 3 times a day now. That&#x27;s a good thing. This means it&#x27;s not allowing the fat to store in places it shouldn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s burning all the toxins now!!! I recommend this product to anyone that wants to lose belly fat fast,without the stress of going to the gym!!!</li>
            <li> I used this cream for about 5 days and I got a rash all over my torso :( badddd I would give this half a star if it let me i had to go to the doc an get cream for my rash.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time before going to the gym and it helps me sweat SOOO MUCHH! I love it and definitely see a difference.</li>
