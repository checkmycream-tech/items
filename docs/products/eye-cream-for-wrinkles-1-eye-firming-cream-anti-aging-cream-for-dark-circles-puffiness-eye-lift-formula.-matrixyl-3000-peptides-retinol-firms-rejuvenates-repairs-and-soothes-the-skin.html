            <li>I am almost 60, have fairly nice skin, and this seems to be making it nicer.</li>
            <li>I really like the eye cream, excellent product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in time it will prove to be effective.</li>
            <li>I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are of my own.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and just feels good.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>Great cream, also used it on my laugh lines and neck.</li>
            <li>I am thinking that&#x27;s the best result I may get at 60 years old.</li>
            <li>She looks great, feels great and says she thinks she looks younger.</li>
            <li>My cystic acne skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very light and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an eye cream that lives up to to the glowing claims most companies make.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so after about two days after I purchased this, the seller kept sending me emails to review the product, but I do not do reviews for the sake of reviews.</li>
            <li>I digress. :-)</li>
            <li>Used replenix eye repair costing much more for several years and find Best Eye Cream comparable..</li>
            <li>so hopefully I will get more results after a longer time frame.</li>
            <li>but the crows feet are looking better.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are &amp;#34;state of the art&amp;#34; and if anything is going to benefit your skin-care regimen you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li>This is the most soothing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream helped my dryness and made my eyes feel better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I sure hope it helps my eyes</li>
            <li>Try it and look fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to purchase more before I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>and I Love how it feels</li>
            <li>Used it as recommended and even more than recommended, besides that it will leave you an oily face</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>If anything, this product was more like toner...</li>
            <li>I sure hope I see some improvements soon.</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>and I love the  beautiful soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>beautiful natural components of which I love.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is so lovely to use, it is smooth, creamy, and unscented.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this well researched product reasonably priced as well!</li>
            <li>Very light going on and does a great job taking away those fine lines, especially around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and is not oily.</li>
            <li>You just have to use a little-it spreads easily &amp; soaks in.  </li>
            <li>My 49 year old daughter told me about this wonderful cream for under your eyes that has many natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li>Slowing down this process is the best i can hope for.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients for my older skin and is rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have done so and notice that the fine lines have become lighter.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product is already softened the appearance of my fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is light and not oily at all absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it to diminish fine lines under my eyes, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet</li>
            <li>you can alredy see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li>While my face is smooth, it is no where smooth like it was the day I applied this after needling the night before, but</li>
            <li>While my face is smooth, it is no where smooth like it was the day I applied this after needling the night before, but</li>
            <li>Great value compared to the last eye cream I bought for three times the price!</li>
            <li>I do like it, I have not seen any improvment yet, but I will give it some time, the texture of the cream is smooth and I like it.</li>
            <li>do like the smell and smooth of cream.</li>
            <li>light, absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>just started using this product,  so far so good</li>
            <li>I currently use an eye cream that I have been happy with but thought I would try this one because it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>Thank You for developing a unique product.</li>
            <li>This cream feels smooth and velvety, soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild scent which is good because I don&#x27;t like heavy perfume scents.</li>
            <li>The most surprising aspect is that it works on other areas as well as the eyes.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and the price was right!</li>
            <li>It feels nice to the touch and absorbs quickly, I am really sensitive to smells and tend to get headaches, I don&#x27;t with this one</li>
            <li>It is also good for upper eye area where you can lose firmness.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need anything else on top.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick pick me up in the eye department.</li>
            <li>and it has a really mild scent.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a new friend :-)</li>
            <li>I love the changes with this product so far!</li>
            <li>I really love this eye cream because it moisturizes the skin in a natural way and helps to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>and so far works better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>Like that the cream is well absorbed.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive fair skin and says she has seen a great difference under her eye area in just less than 2 weeks and wanted me to try it since our skin is similar.  </li>
            <li>I love how well this cream has worked at reducing dark circles under my eyes as well as the fine lines at the corners!</li>
            <li>A small amount does a great job.</li>
            <li>only been using for two weeks but so far it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t see actual results until I&#x27;ve used it longer, but right off the bat</li>
            <li>Its a very gentle formula that didn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li>and I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and started to see some fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>far, this product does some of the things it says it will do, I would also like to add for you ladies that are like me and have super super oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger than most of the jars of eye cream you get at retailers.</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams and most recently used Obagi which is grossly over priced for what it does.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream, I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>:-)er needling with the derma roller zendi roller, the next day my skin was the softest it had ever been in my life.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to reduce the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
            <li>Actually, I see more pronounced wrinkles and have to use a filler/blur to mask them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Very moist, creamy and even wear it under our makeup!  </li>
            <li>and I saw results in the first two days.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to package this in a pump form as I think it&#x27;s more hygenic for around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the thin consistency of it, more of a watery product, but seems very effective.  </li>
            <li>She called me the next day, very excitedly told me that after 15 minutes the lines were so relaxed they were not noticeable and puffiness was gone.  </li>
            <li>It is clear that is must used consistently and on clean skin</li>
            <li>I can usually tell if it&#x27;s a good product the first time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is pretty much still a &amp;#34;premature&amp;#34; review, considered it I ordered it on December 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a decent size, most eye creams are pricey and come in a tiny  jar.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far and plan to continue using it as long as I see results like these!</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much firming of the skin.</li>
            <li>I can tell from not having to put on as much concealer.</li>
            <li>really like the lightness and effectiveness of this eye cream - I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I expected it to arrive in better condition.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and this cream really hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturiIng, too soon to tell about lines around my eyes....</li>
            <li>Integral Beauty Advanced Firming Eye Creme promises 4 WEEKS TO YOUNGER LOOKING EYES:</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>Received on the October 13th..to early to really comment on product..</li>
            <li>Many creams feel heavy or leave a residue NOT this one.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, not greasy, smells lovely.</li>
            <li>In just a couple weeks my face is much more firm and the wrinkles have diminished dramatically.</li>
            <li>I do like the fragrance and will continue to use it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Terrific eye cream - just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which is great cause the product is lasting!</li>
            <li>After just the first use, my skin felt so much smoother and softer than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>It does make fine lines less noticeable</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it works! </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for a cream that will do a little more than what I currently have.  </li>
            <li>Once I applied the cream you can feel it take action</li>
            <li>No adverse reaction to sensitive eyes either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only begun to use this, but I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it twice a day and have not seen any improvement so far.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance seems all natural from the plants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants results.</li>
            <li>Very nicely surprised.  </li>
            <li>I definitely feel it&#x27;s a high quality product</li>
            <li>I have less under eye puffiness too, which is a big deal to me as I suffer from allergies and can have huge bags under my eyes during allergy season.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and usually heavier creams help this.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin as some products have done in the past.</li>
            <li>The packaging was safety sealed however the cream leaked around the sides and seemed to be missing 1/4 of the full jar.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the eye cream for a few days now, and can tell a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin in the winter time, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that really helps, until I found this product.</li>
            <li>This new eye cream is just as good and far less expensive.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really had it long enough to see any drastic change.  </li>
            <li>I am a 32 year old guy and have been in the sun surfing my entire life.</li>
            <li>love it, no more buffy eyes and relaxed the stress  around my eyes, no complains, no irritation , brightend the dark cyrcle around my eyes</li>
            <li>If a company is willing to stand behind their product, than i am willing to try it.</li>
            <li>not so wore out, which has been nice not constantly being asked if I am tired by my coworkers!</li>
            <li>but this cream helps a lot in furthering more damages to my eyes due to staying up so late every night.</li>
            <li>that aside I wanted to say that so far I am very impressed with the cream ( i use it for my entire face, not just eyes) which speaks  volumes because usually you DO have to wait at least 30 days to see results when it comes to a product of this nature, however in the few days I have been using it the texture of my skin has softened ALOT ( dark african american skin).</li>
            <li>and it does not make the little fine lines seem less as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to at least give myself a week (and which I usually like to wait a month with stuff like this) before I did an honest review.  </li>
            <li>It really got rid of my dark circles!</li>
            <li>I dab a little on my finger tips and gently rub onto my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I thank you so much for putting this little miracle in a jar.  </li>
            <li>Works great and much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was so happy about how it worked on my fine lines and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 60, have fairly nice skin, and this seems to be making it nicer.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye cream, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in time it will prove to be effective.</li>
            <li> I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are of my own.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and just feels good.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great cream, also used it on my laugh lines and neck.</li>
            <li> I am thinking that&#x27;s the best result I may get at 60 years old.</li>
            <li> She looks great, feels great and says she thinks she looks younger.</li>
            <li> My cystic acne skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very light and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an eye cream that lives up to to the glowing claims most companies make.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so after about two days after I purchased this, the seller kept sending me emails to review the product, but I do not do reviews for the sake of reviews.</li>
            <li> I digress. :-)</li>
            <li> Used replenix eye repair costing much more for several years and find Best Eye Cream comparable..</li>
            <li> so hopefully I will get more results after a longer time frame.</li>
            <li> but the crows feet are looking better.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are &amp;#34;state of the art&amp;#34; and if anything is going to benefit your skin-care regimen you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> This is the most soothing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream helped my dryness and made my eyes feel better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I sure hope it helps my eyes</li>
            <li> Try it and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to purchase more before I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> and I Love how it feels</li>
            <li> Used it as recommended and even more than recommended, besides that it will leave you an oily face</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li> If anything, this product was more like toner...</li>
            <li> I sure hope I see some improvements soon.</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> and I love the  beautiful soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li> beautiful natural components of which I love.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so lovely to use, it is smooth, creamy, and unscented.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this well researched product reasonably priced as well!</li>
            <li> Very light going on and does a great job taking away those fine lines, especially around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is not oily.</li>
            <li> You just have to use a little-it spreads easily &amp; soaks in.  </li>
            <li> My 49 year old daughter told me about this wonderful cream for under your eyes that has many natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li> Slowing down this process is the best i can hope for.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients for my older skin and is rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have done so and notice that the fine lines have become lighter.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product is already softened the appearance of my fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is light and not oily at all absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it to diminish fine lines under my eyes, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet</li>
            <li> you can alredy see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li> While my face is smooth, it is no where smooth like it was the day I applied this after needling the night before, but</li>
            <li> While my face is smooth, it is no where smooth like it was the day I applied this after needling the night before, but</li>
            <li> Great value compared to the last eye cream I bought for three times the price!</li>
            <li> I do like it, I have not seen any improvment yet, but I will give it some time, the texture of the cream is smooth and I like it.</li>
            <li> do like the smell and smooth of cream.</li>
            <li> light, absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> just started using this product,  so far so good</li>
            <li> I currently use an eye cream that I have been happy with but thought I would try this one because it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> Thank You for developing a unique product.</li>
            <li> This cream feels smooth and velvety, soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mild scent which is good because I don&#x27;t like heavy perfume scents.</li>
            <li> The most surprising aspect is that it works on other areas as well as the eyes.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and the price was right!</li>
            <li> It feels nice to the touch and absorbs quickly, I am really sensitive to smells and tend to get headaches, I don&#x27;t with this one</li>
            <li> It is also good for upper eye area where you can lose firmness.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need anything else on top.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick pick me up in the eye department.</li>
            <li> and it has a really mild scent.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a new friend :-)</li>
            <li> I love the changes with this product so far!</li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream because it moisturizes the skin in a natural way and helps to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> and so far works better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> Like that the cream is well absorbed.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive fair skin and says she has seen a great difference under her eye area in just less than 2 weeks and wanted me to try it since our skin is similar.  </li>
            <li> I love how well this cream has worked at reducing dark circles under my eyes as well as the fine lines at the corners!</li>
            <li> A small amount does a great job.</li>
            <li> only been using for two weeks but so far it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t see actual results until I&#x27;ve used it longer, but right off the bat</li>
            <li> Its a very gentle formula that didn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li> and I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and started to see some fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> far, this product does some of the things it says it will do, I would also like to add for you ladies that are like me and have super super oily skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than most of the jars of eye cream you get at retailers.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams and most recently used Obagi which is grossly over priced for what it does.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> :-)er needling with the derma roller zendi roller, the next day my skin was the softest it had ever been in my life.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to reduce the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Actually, I see more pronounced wrinkles and have to use a filler/blur to mask them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> Very moist, creamy and even wear it under our makeup!  </li>
            <li> and I saw results in the first two days.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to package this in a pump form as I think it&#x27;s more hygenic for around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the thin consistency of it, more of a watery product, but seems very effective.  </li>
            <li> She called me the next day, very excitedly told me that after 15 minutes the lines were so relaxed they were not noticeable and puffiness was gone.  </li>
            <li> It is clear that is must used consistently and on clean skin</li>
            <li> I can usually tell if it&#x27;s a good product the first time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Well, this is pretty much still a &amp;#34;premature&amp;#34; review, considered it I ordered it on December 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a decent size, most eye creams are pricey and come in a tiny  jar.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far and plan to continue using it as long as I see results like these!</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much firming of the skin.</li>
            <li> I can tell from not having to put on as much concealer.</li>
            <li> really like the lightness and effectiveness of this eye cream - I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to arrive in better condition.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and this cream really hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturiIng, too soon to tell about lines around my eyes....</li>
            <li> Integral Beauty Advanced Firming Eye Creme promises 4 WEEKS TO YOUNGER LOOKING EYES:</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> Received on the October 13th..to early to really comment on product..</li>
            <li> Many creams feel heavy or leave a residue NOT this one.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, not greasy, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> In just a couple weeks my face is much more firm and the wrinkles have diminished dramatically.</li>
            <li> I do like the fragrance and will continue to use it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Terrific eye cream - just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which is great cause the product is lasting!</li>
            <li> After just the first use, my skin felt so much smoother and softer than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> It does make fine lines less noticeable</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it works! </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for a cream that will do a little more than what I currently have.  </li>
            <li> Once I applied the cream you can feel it take action</li>
            <li> No adverse reaction to sensitive eyes either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to use this, but I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it twice a day and have not seen any improvement so far.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance seems all natural from the plants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants results.</li>
            <li> Very nicely surprised.  </li>
            <li> I definitely feel it&#x27;s a high quality product</li>
            <li> I have less under eye puffiness too, which is a big deal to me as I suffer from allergies and can have huge bags under my eyes during allergy season.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and usually heavier creams help this.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin as some products have done in the past.</li>
            <li> The packaging was safety sealed however the cream leaked around the sides and seemed to be missing 1/4 of the full jar.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the eye cream for a few days now, and can tell a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter time, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that really helps, until I found this product.</li>
            <li> This new eye cream is just as good and far less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really had it long enough to see any drastic change.  </li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old guy and have been in the sun surfing my entire life.</li>
            <li> love it, no more buffy eyes and relaxed the stress  around my eyes, no complains, no irritation , brightend the dark cyrcle around my eyes</li>
            <li> If a company is willing to stand behind their product, than i am willing to try it.</li>
            <li> not so wore out, which has been nice not constantly being asked if I am tired by my coworkers!</li>
            <li> but this cream helps a lot in furthering more damages to my eyes due to staying up so late every night.</li>
            <li> that aside I wanted to say that so far I am very impressed with the cream ( i use it for my entire face, not just eyes) which speaks  volumes because usually you DO have to wait at least 30 days to see results when it comes to a product of this nature, however in the few days I have been using it the texture of my skin has softened ALOT ( dark african american skin).</li>
            <li> and it does not make the little fine lines seem less as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to at least give myself a week (and which I usually like to wait a month with stuff like this) before I did an honest review.  </li>
            <li> It really got rid of my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I dab a little on my finger tips and gently rub onto my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I thank you so much for putting this little miracle in a jar.  </li>
            <li> Works great and much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> but then i am 61 years old and am realistic in realizing that it&#x27;s hard to reverse the aging process.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  eliminate them completely, but definitely noticed they became less visible after three week of use.</li>
            <li> Not sure I have seen any real difference</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any lightning or softening of my tear troughs, but I think its a hit and miss with tear troughs as I think that for some people they are hereditary and you only run so far from your genes, but once again it&#x27;s only been a few days, so if I do notice changing in my tear troughs</li>
            <li> I started using it but hasn&#x27;t been long enough.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase it as long as it remains so.  </li>
            <li> She took me seriously and sent me a new container, just like that!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would moisturize my dry eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Have only tried it a few times, but I&#x27;m not seeing any irritation, which is often a big issue for me with eye creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams for dark circles and puffiness, and this is obviously helping.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to soften a few lines as long as they are not to deep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for a little over a week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I use a heavy duty concealer called Glamoflage, and have downgraded to regular concealer.  </li>
            <li> and its only been a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> It is helping my crows feet after only a few days.</li>
            <li> not the quality that I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a few different eye creams and this one tops my list.</li>
            <li> I went back and purchased another one to give her for her birthday in a few months.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Time will tell about the other attributes.</li>
            <li> I let one of my friends feel my face at work, and she told other people and they kept coming up to me wanting to feel my face.  </li>
            <li> I let one of my friends feel my face at work, and she told other people and they kept coming up to me wanting to feel my face.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the contents did not all spill out, but it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> My under eye area looks smoother without the little lines or dry areas!</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t weigh my skin down and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight improvement with the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye cream costs a lot less</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few days and can already see the dark circles from under my eyes getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> The circles, have faded a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It is far too soon to see any startling results.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t drag the delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Due to illness my eyes looked horrible and I already look so much better</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, it is not oily, nor is it too watery.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad allergies and my eyes water and from dabbing the corners of my eyes, I had a rash.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the jar lid was broken.</li>
            <li> i ave used for a month now and have seen not many changes</li>
            <li> I think it works, no more visible creases and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no scent and goes on nicely, not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review  product when i just started using it and cannot see any results - this takes time.  </li>
            <li> and I hardly order something again but had to order this again.</li>
            <li> I tried a few Avon Anew products, which appeared to be making the problems worse.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency almost like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes, not that I need that yet ;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I wish I had saved the money to put toward La Mer or something hydrating.</li>
            <li> Holy crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only used the eye cream for a few days now, and can tell a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. Hope to see even more results as I continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Glass was all smashed and the company immediately sent me a replacement. Jury still out on if cream works, but good company.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream. It has a nice mild scent which is good because I don&#x27;t like heavy perfume scents. It does make fine lines less noticeable but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much firming of the skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I&#x27;ll give it a couple of weeks and compare results. I definitely feel it&#x27;s a high quality product and I would purchase it again. It&#x27;s not a tiny jar either. It&#x27;s larger than most of the jars of eye cream you get at retailers. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I like the gel like consistency instead of that lotion-y feel. A little goes a long way which is great cause the product is lasting! Its a very gentle formula that didn&#x27;t irritate at all. I&#x27;m definitely seeing a difference. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick pick me up in the eye department.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream because it moisturizes the skin in a natural way and helps to keep my skin hydrated. No fragrance and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams for dark circles and puffiness, and this is obviously helping.  It is truly the only thing I have ever used where I see noticeable results with the puffiness.  I&#x27;ve tried Garner, Body Shop, much more expensive brands, kept them in the refrigerator, etc.  The circles, have faded a little bit.  I can tell from not having to put on as much concealer. I use a heavy duty concealer called Glamoflage, and have downgraded to regular concealer.  The one thing this cream does not do is moisturize.  I have to apply it a lot, and if I keep using it will probably have to use it in tandem with a moisturizing eye cream.  As for the wrinkles, no obvious change but I&#x27;m 56 so I&#x27;m stuck with some of them.  All and all I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great cream, also used it on my laugh lines and neck. Absorbs quickly not greasy or messy. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using the advance firming eye cream, applying morning and night, for several weeks. I have noticed a slight improvement with the lines around my eyes. I am thinking that&#x27;s the best result I may get at 60 years old. But I will continue to use the product and see what happens.</li>
            <li> really like the lightness and effectiveness of this eye cream - I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream is a great moisturizer and I do like it very much.  I have used it for a few weeks twice a day.  It is far too soon to see any startling results. I have used many eye creams and most recently used Obagi which is grossly over priced for what it does. This new eye cream is just as good and far less expensive.  I will continue to purchase it as long as it remains so.  It does seem to soften a few lines as long as they are not to deep.  I have yet to find an eye cream that lives up to to the glowing claims most companies make.  As long as your expectations are not too high, this is a fine product priced reasonably.  Time will tell about the other attributes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about a week and have seen improvements around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for a couple of years and needed to try something different. This eye cream costs a lot less and so far works better than what I was using before. Can&#x27;t wait to see future results.</li>
            <li> The packaging was safety sealed however the cream leaked around the sides and seemed to be missing 1/4 of the full jar.  When I used the product for me as a guy I like to feel the product working as well as see the results. Once I applied the cream you can feel it take action and its only been a few days but it seems to maybe be working.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product I am using it every night. I am a night owl and I have eyebags but this cream helps a lot in furthering more damages to my eyes due to staying up so late every night.</li>
            <li> This is quality I cream. I have been using it for a few weeks now and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> love it, no more buffy eyes and relaxed the stress  around my eyes, no complains, no irritation , brightend the dark cyrcle around my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few days and can already see the dark circles from under my eyes getting lighter.</li>
            <li> The cream feels great. Goes on easily and is not oily. My only complaint is that the jar lid was broken. Luckily the contents did not all spill out, but it was disappointing. I expected it to arrive in better condition.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li> to keep this short i did like this anti aiging ceam i ave used for a month now and have seen not many changes</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful.  The instructions say that you can use it all over your face.  I have done so and notice that the fine lines have become lighter.  You can actually feel the product making your face tighter.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream!!  Works great and much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I think it works, no more visible creases and puffiness. No adverse reaction to sensitive eyes either. Good stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to use this, but I&#x27;m really liking it.  Very light going on and does a great job taking away those fine lines, especially around the eyes.  I think I&#x27;ve found a new friend :-)</li>
            <li> Okay, so after about two days after I purchased this, the seller kept sending me emails to review the product, but I do not do reviews for the sake of reviews. I wanted to at least give myself a week (and which I usually like to wait a month with stuff like this) before I did an honest review.  Well, this is pretty much still a &amp;#34;premature&amp;#34; review, considered it I ordered it on December 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside I wanted to say that so far I am very impressed with the cream ( i use it for my entire face, not just eyes) which speaks  volumes because usually you DO have to wait at least 30 days to see results when it comes to a product of this nature, however in the few days I have been using it the texture of my skin has softened ALOT ( dark african american skin). My cystic acne skin is very smooth. I have not noticed any lightning or softening of my tear troughs, but I think its a hit and miss with tear troughs as I think that for some people they are hereditary and you only run so far from your genes, but once again it&#x27;s only been a few days, so if I do notice changing in my tear troughs I will come back and update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this product does some of the things it says it will do, I would also like to add for you ladies that are like me and have super super oily skin, you can put this on and it does not make your already oily skin oiler. That is one problem that I battle with moisturizers. Us oily girls need to moisturize our skin as well (an argument that I have with my dermatologist) but when we do, even if it is &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34;, we tend to look like oil slicks by the end of the day.  This cream will not do that.  Matter of fact, I think it helps with the control of the oil. I am actually looking at my face in the mirror while i type this, and my skin is not oily at all.  Lastly, I recommend this cream for &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; face care, not just the eyes. I will update if I notice anymore benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  When I use this cream after needling with the derma roller zendi roller, the next day my skin was the softest it had ever been in my life. I let one of my friends feel my face at work, and she told other people and they kept coming up to me wanting to feel my face.  Only problem is that I still have to get used to needling. I can see the benefits but it does hurt. While my face is smooth, it is no where smooth like it was the day I applied this after needling the night before, but I digress. :-)er needling with the derma roller zendi roller, the next day my skin was the softest it had ever been in my life.

            <li> only been using for two weeks but so far it&#x27;s good.  Used replenix eye repair costing much more for several years and find Best Eye Cream comparable..</li>
            <li> It really got rid of my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I would buy this again - I think it works!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!! Very light and hydrating. I use it every morning and night. I am seeing the results!!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and I really like it. Haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks so hopefully I will get more results after a longer time frame. So far so good.</li>
            <li> An awesome product that I received as a promotion. It has really helped to reduce the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and pleasant smell of this product and their great customer service. It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks but the crows feet are looking better. Great value compared to the last eye cream I bought for three times the price!</li>
            <li> Terrific eye cream - just the right consistency. The ingredients are &amp;#34;state of the art&amp;#34; and if anything is going to benefit your skin-care regimen you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> This eye cream was purchased for my wife who thinks she needs it. (She doesn&#x27;t in my opinion). She loves it. Uses it daily now as part of her beauty routine. She looks great, feels great and says she thinks she looks younger. I&#x27;m biased on her beauty. Great product though, happy wife.</li>
            <li> This is the most soothing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have pretty bad allergies and my eyes water and from dabbing the corners of my eyes, I had a rash.  This eye cream helped my dryness and made my eyes feel better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and have not seen any remarkable results. Hope it shows some signs soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye cream!!</li>
            <li> Received the product no hassle at all.  Too early to tell if it works! </li>
            <li> I have been using this since 3/27 and this cream really hasn&#x27;t done much for me.  I broke out when I started using it and it does not make the little fine lines seem less as I was hoping.  I currently use an eye cream that I have been happy with but thought I would try this one because it has such good reviews. I am always on the hunt for a cream that will do a little more than what I currently have.  It feels nice to the touch and absorbs quickly, I am really sensitive to smells and tend to get headaches, I don&#x27;t with this one and it has a really mild scent. All in all it is a good cream but it isn&#x27;t enough to make me switch from what I am currently using. Back to the drawing board.  :)</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago. I feel this product is already softened the appearance of my fine lines under my eyes. It is light weight and usually heavier creams help this. I will definitely keep using this, if this continues to show improvement. I am almost 60, have fairly nice skin, and this seems to be making it nicer. Thank You for developing a unique product.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells good</li>
            <li> Very moisturiIng, too soon to tell about lines around my eyes....so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and feels great on my face.  Many creams feel heavy or leave a residue NOT this one.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Didn&#x27;t  eliminate them completely, but definitely noticed they became less visible after three week of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Goes on smoothly, not greasy, smells lovely. It is helping my crows feet after only a few days. Personelle at company was responsive when I voiced a concern about the package having leaked during delivery. She took me seriously and sent me a new container, just like that!! Would order again for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review  product when i just started using it and cannot see any results - this takes time.  I did receive this product on time and with no problems.  I sure hope it helps my eyes but then i am 61 years old and am realistic in realizing that it&#x27;s hard to reverse the aging process.  Slowing down this process is the best i can hope for.</li>
            <li> Holy crap. I just got this and no joke I have had this cream on maybe 15 minutes and the bags/puffiness under my eyes is gone. I am like on 5 hrs of sleep and I look like I came back from a spa .  I have been on the search for a good product, this is the best one I have found. I highly recommend this product. Try it and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Integral Beauty Advanced Firming Eye Creme promises 4 WEEKS TO YOUNGER LOOKING EYES: Well I have been using this for about 10 days and I can honestly say I can already see a difference! My under eye area looks smoother without the little lines or dry areas! I have less under eye puffiness too, which is a big deal to me as I suffer from allergies and can have huge bags under my eyes during allergy season. I am loving this product so far and plan to continue using it as long as I see results like these!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  Stopped using it after two weeks.</li>
            <li> This eye cream actually seems to be working!  I&#x27;m 36 years old and started to see some fine lines around my eyes.  I tried a few Avon Anew products, which appeared to be making the problems worse.  I searched on Amazon and found this eye cream, thinking I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and see improvement in the skin around my eyes.  I recommended it to my mother and I&#x27;m going to purchase more before I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It does not leave my skin feeling greasy and oily.  I really feel and see the difference in just couple weeks.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really had it long enough to see any drastic change.  I have noticed that by applying it before eye make up; it creates a smoother look.  That&#x27;s a good thing!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I absolutely love it you can alredy see a huge difference. Due to illness my eyes looked horrible and I already look so much better just wanted to share this. Would love to have gotten some sooner!</li>
            <li> not the quality that I expected</li>
            <li> I do like it, I have not seen any improvment yet, but I will give it some time, the texture of the cream is smooth and I like it.</li>
            <li> Can make my eyes beauty</li>
            <li> I am not at all impressed with the product. I see no change or improvement. Actually, I see more pronounced wrinkles and have to use a filler/blur to mask them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using properly for about a month. Based on reviews I thought I would try the product. I will not be using again.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye cream, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am a 32 year old guy and have been in the sun surfing my entire life. I was told to try this product for the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. In just a couple weeks my face is much more firm and the wrinkles have diminished dramatically. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so lovely to use, it is smooth, creamy, and unscented. It doesn&#x27;t drag the delicate skin around your eyes. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY SON.  HE SAYS HE LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> Have only tried it a few times, but I&#x27;m not seeing any irritation, which is often a big issue for me with eye creams. Shipping was fast and it seems like a quality product. I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t see actual results until I&#x27;ve used it longer, but right off the bat it seems moisturizing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and the price was right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a few different eye creams and this one tops my list. Great ingredients for my older skin and is rapidly absorbed. Really good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent eye cream with some very good ingredients. It&#x27;s very soothing and creamy which I like.  Not sure I have seen any real difference but I have only been using it for two weeks. Hopefully in time it will prove to be effective. In the meantime, but eye concealer goes on very nicely over it, and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Have second jar on the way.  This really works!  It is also good for upper eye area where you can lose firmness.  I was so happy about how it worked on my fine lines and crows feet.  I definitely look younger.  It&#x27;s the best I have tried and I hardly order something again but had to order this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would moisturize my dry eyelids.  I have been using for over a month and have not noticed any difference. I would not buy agin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I does have a firming effect. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, and the service was great!! I have only used this product 3 times, and I am already seeing results. Thank you, Jacqui!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it twice a day and have not seen any improvement so far.  I do like the fragrance and will continue to use it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> good deal. fast shipping and seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> When I am debating on whether or not to buy a product, seeing the 100% money back guarantee always cinches it for me. If a company is willing to stand behind their product, than i am willing to try it. This product is no exception. It doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation, and helps the puffiness around my eyes. It goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin as some products have done in the past. I am not trying to make my eyes look younger (yet!) but I am trying to prevent wrinkles in the future, and these product helps with that. I haven&#x27;t been moisturizing around my eyes at all, so know is as good of time as any to start. Give it a try!  I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my unbiased, honest review. All thoughts are of my own.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin!</li>
            <li> Ordered this cream because the reviews were so great. Do not find that atall, and have no results after about 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is awesome! I seriously love the way this cream feels!</li>
            <li> Great product. Feels good on eyes. It has a thin consistency almost like a lotion. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; I do not see any noticeable changes after using it for about a month. But it is great just as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Did not work for me!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!After using it I see a noticeable improvement in the skin around the eyes.Like that the cream is well absorbed.</li>
            <li> I started using it but hasn&#x27;t been long enough. I will continue to use it to see results. I like that it has no scent and goes on nicely, not greasy or heavy. Looking fwd to seeing results!</li>
            <li> Love!  I just bought it and used it twice and I Love how it feels and I love the  beautiful soft fragrance.  beautiful natural components of which I love. The fragrance seems all natural from the plants.</li>
            <li> I just received it two days ago - have no idea how it will work for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, but I really like it. It is light and not oily at all absorbs into my skin very quickly.A small amount does a great job. Will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for one week and do see results. It is clear that is must used consistently and on clean skin but it does work.  The most surprising aspect is that it works on other areas as well as the eyes. I will continue to look for results and report as I do so.</li>
            <li> Great eye creme!  I like to try different brands of eye creams &amp; anything for the face.  I can usually tell if it&#x27;s a good product the first time I use it.  This cream is wonderful! Refreshing and just feels good.  You just have to use a little-it spreads easily &amp; soaks in.  You really don&#x27;t need anything else on top.  You can put eyeliner &amp; mascara on &amp; go!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t do anything. Used it as recommended and even more than recommended, besides that it will leave you an oily face nothing else happens, wrinkles are there just as they were there before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I have noticed great improvemnet</li>
            <li> My 49 year old daughter told me about this wonderful cream for under your eyes that has many natural ingredients!  She has very sensitive fair skin and says she has seen a great difference under her eye area in just less than 2 weeks and wanted me to try it since our skin is similar.  I love it!  Very moist, creamy and even wear it under our makeup!  We Also put on our foreheads where lines can form!  I am very pleased with this well researched product reasonably priced as well!</li>
            <li> I love the changes with this product so far!</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It goes on easily, it is not oily, nor is it too watery. It has no perfumes which to me is a plus. I use it to diminish fine lines under my eyes, so far so good. It is also a decent size, most eye creams are pricey and come in a tiny  jar. So this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Received on the October 13th..to early to really comment on product..my main concerns are eyes, neck and lines around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smell and smooth of cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> This cream feels smooth and velvety, soaks into the skin quickly. I didn&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes, not that I need that yet ;-))&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service is awesome. They truly help with all the possible questions. Real people. Real service.</li>
            <li> I started using this eye cream about a week and I saw results in the first two days. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants results.</li>
            <li> seems to be helping my facial skin by moisturizing and lines seem to be disappearing</li>
            <li> very nice eye cream. light, absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the good reviews!  If anything, this product was more like toner...it tightened a bit, but was so drying.  I won&#x27;t even use it on my neck...zero moisture.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I wish I had saved the money to put toward La Mer or something hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for a little over a week... So it&#x27;s way to soon to see anything ...but my reason for ordering this eye cream is for lines and wrinkles and see no difference so soon... I sure hope I see some improvements soon.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my miracle in a jar! I have very dry skin in the winter time, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that really helps, until I found this product. I dab a little on my finger tips and gently rub onto my face and neck. After just the first use, my skin felt so much smoother and softer than it has in a long time. Plus it doesn&#x27;t weigh my skin down and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I can see the lines on my forehead and crows feet are starting to fill in and not look as noticeable as they once were. I will definitely be buying another jar when this one runs out. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review!</li>
            <li> The consistency makes it really a great skin cream. This product is NOT eye cream</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m lovin it! Will keep using!</li>
            <li> firmed up my eyes and made them look younger</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It seems to have an immediate plumping effect on my expression lines and I like to use it all over my face.  I was surprised by the thin consistency of it, more of a watery product, but seems very effective.  No problems with breakouts or any irritation.  Very nicely surprised.  Would definately purchase again.  My only suggestion is to package this in a pump form as I think it&#x27;s more hygenic for around the eye area.</li>
            <li> just started using this product,  so far so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed when I see how the wrinkles under my eyes have flattened!  I&#x27;m 65 and have tried a lot of products and never had these results!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister because she keeps complaining about the crows feet and puffiness around her eyes.  She called me the next day, very excitedly told me that after 15 minutes the lines were so relaxed they were not noticeable and puffiness was gone.  Oh my, this really IS a great product!  She is so very grateful for something like this, so I thank you so much for putting this little miracle in a jar.  I went back and purchased another one to give her for her birthday in a few months.</li>
            <li> I love how well this cream has worked at reducing dark circles under my eyes as well as the fine lines at the corners! Has made me look not so wore out, which has been nice not constantly being asked if I am tired by my coworkers!</li>
