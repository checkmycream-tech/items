    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works perfectly for traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly compact.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush comes in a beautiful case.  </li>
            <li>Is great for packing in my overnight case</li>
            <li>, this works great in a travel bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this for traveling, and hope to get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li>Light weight and powered by one AAA battery, perfect for travel!</li>
            <li>I kept getting warned about gum disease, but now I&#x27;m on the good list.</li>
            <li>This will make a great travel brush since it runs on batteries, making it easy to tote.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a nice travel toothbrush, and this fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though I didn&#x27;t care that it was a vibrating toothbrush, I considered that a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Looks nice for travel or fancy ladies room.</li>
            <li>so this is a nice evolution for the travel brush.</li>
            <li>While this product is good, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because I don&#x27;t think it does much more than an inexpensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush when I got it a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I am also very glad to have a cap to this brush -- if you keep this brush in your bathroom, it&#x27;s so much better than the brush head being exposed to the elements.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had regular-sized vibrating toothbrushes, and they were better, but this one is sufficient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I think I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more to give as gifts to people who do a lot of traveling.</li>
            <li>It is very portable and is great for travel.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is one of those you can buy in the street markets in Asia.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK, though.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel as if there is anything magical about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve had 2 six-month checkups, I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the outer appeal of the toothbrush, using it was even better.</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to carry and compact for an electronic \\&quot;travel\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(it runs on one AAA battery, which is said to provide up to 180 minutes of usage) makes it easy to bring along.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;d have a more full length handle and wouldn&#x27;t have to set down the cap separately, then this thing would be the perfect travel</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>but it could be a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>this is really cheap made product.</li>
            <li>Oral hygiene is important and I needed to tend to brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is much better than a regular brush but goes in your purse in a nice container for quick jobs.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this toothbrush, so I was very surprised that I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>Good price and the battery has lasted for a while yet over a month of lengthy daily use</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a bad thing</li>
            <li>Most would expect the elegant tube to contain mascara rather than a toothbrush, and the entire unit is both waterproof and 100% washable.</li>
            <li>I normally use a regular toothbrush or a spinbrush, and I&#x27;ve been happy with them until now.  </li>
            <li>The silver case is awesome--very pretty!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Compact, handy, batteries last a long time, does a nice job, etc.  </li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>Also the ultrasonic vibration makes the brush much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Apparently my old brushes didn&#x27;t clean as well as I thought they did!  </li>
            <li>The brush is quiet and easy to use, and it feels comfortable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Nice for kids, maybe, but the power is so weak that this is effectively a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For years I have used mini travel toothbrushs that I never cared for very much.</li>
            <li>I appreciated having this cap especially when taking the toothbrush on vacation, making this brush so easy to pack and stay clean.  </li>
            <li>The smaller head of the brush makes it more maneuverable to get to the molars and in the gumline for a very complete clean.  </li>
            <li>These are beautifully designed but alas not durable.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m used to something a little more on the aggressive side, like our everyday, rechargeable Oral-B spin brush, this vibrating brush still gives your teeth a nice, clean feeling while being gentle on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works just fine for short travel time.</li>
            <li>I really like having a case cover to place on my toothbrush when I&#x27;m travelling.</li>
            <li>Environmentally, it does not seem responsible to me as it has a plastic case and battery</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner with the Panasonic brush.  </li>
            <li>The results are so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sleek-looking, too.  </li>
            <li>, I find it makes me slow down and brush more which I&#x27;m sure my dentist would approve of, and it helps me to reach my back teeth without gagging, but that small of head on a toothbrush isn&#x27;t going to be good for everyone and it takes a lot more time to get your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is quiet, quick, and it doesn&#x27;t shred my gums.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to operate, and the lid keeps your toothbrush clean in a tight space because it won&#x27;t pop off like some of the travel tooth brush cases you get for regular tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>normal, battery operation does nothing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the asking price for what it is and remained unimpressed.</li>
            <li>but I still have to do all the work that I would have to do with a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>More benefit  than  plain toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than an ordinary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lightweight, only requires one battery, is fairly quiet when running, has a gentle vibration, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Definitely not a replacement for a sonicare toothbrush, but if you&#x27;re used to getting that extra clean feeling</li>
            <li>So that the wet brush head can dry, the cap does contain two slits at the top for air to circulate.  </li>
            <li>Will not feel anything near like your home electric brush.</li>
            <li>Early electric toothbrushes took up a lot of space on the counter and they were noisy as a beehive up against your head.</li>
            <li>The battery has lasted a long time and I am still on the first one.  </li>
            <li>Its very compact and solidly built.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, have had it for almost 4 months now and used it frequently for travel and camping, and have not had to replace the battery yet.  </li>
            <li>#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing differently, but keep doing it!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not an absolutely faithful flosser, but do try for 4/7 times for week.  </li>
            <li>As a recent convert to the non-manual toothbrush world, I have to say this brush is so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be if they could taper the lid to fit on the other side of the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The case is small and sleek, and is easy to store in my handbag.</li>
            <li>For some reason, whenever we travel, the thing I&#x27;m most likely to forgot to pack is a toothbrush--not that it&#x27;s a tough thing to track down in other cities, but, for the convenience factor, it&#x27;s nice to have the Panasonic Adult Portable Compact Toothbrush sitting in my toiletries bag always ready for action.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and have lasted a long time considering I push hard when brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>well an was surprised when a compact toothbrush arrived instead of a regular size.</li>
            <li>The action of the brush is also totally inadequate.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly ordered the compact size and the brush is way too small to be useful.  </li>

            <li> The small size makes them a bit awkward for regular use at home but these toothbrushes are perfect for travel, as they are smaller than your typical non-electric toothbrush plus case.  </li>
            <li> The single battery held up to daily use without any loss in power for over a two week holiday.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be due for a brush head change, but the suggestion from the product description states 2 months until replacement.</li>
            <li> I had trouble reaching the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The last time I travelled I didn&#x27;t have a case for my battery powered toothbrush, so when I arrived at my destination the battery was dead</li>
            <li> The first one unfortunately fell victim to a leaky battery.  </li>
            <li> The brush area itself is rather small, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but the brush works well.</li>
            <li> You have a tendency to push down harder and brush like using a manual brush, which defeats the purpose of having an electric brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> and I had to deal with the dead toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel with my oral Bmelectric toothbrush since it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> like the fact that it has a cover that locks in place, and that there&#x27;s a small vent to let air circulate.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a trip overseas and when I used it, it was so small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Nothing moves on it, it just vibrates, and you can get a toothbrush like that for about $12 in the store, and the head is REALLY small.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what to compare this to.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that replacement brush heads are prohibitively expensive.  </li>
            <li> Worse, my gums bled.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Nothing better than an ordinary toothbrush.  Still have to brush like normal, battery operation does nothing.</li>
            <li> Light weight and powered by one AAA battery, perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> this is really cheap made product. I am sure it is one of those you can buy in the street markets in Asia. The vibrating effect is not even noticiable</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a trip overseas and when I used it, it was so small I had trouble reaching the back of my mouth. The action of the brush is also totally inadequate.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to carry and compact for an electronic \\&quot;travel\\&quot; toothbrush. The single battery held up to daily use without any loss in power for over a two week holiday. Obviously it will not have the same force as your home use Sonicare or Oral-B electronic brushes. This is an upgrade to the manual folding brushes I have been using for travel. Also the ultrasonic vibration makes the brush much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little toothbrush. The brush area itself is rather small, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but the brush works well. The silver case is awesome--very pretty! I really like having a case cover to place on my toothbrush when I&#x27;m travelling. The last time I travelled I didn&#x27;t have a case for my battery powered toothbrush, so when I arrived at my destination the battery was dead and I had to deal with the dead toothbrush. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have gotten used to using a battery operated brush at home so this is a nice evolution for the travel brush. For years I have used mini travel toothbrushs that I never cared for very much. This unit is compact but not tiny, anout the size of a standard brush but uit does it&#x27;s electric toothbrush job admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I was in grade school, my aunt gave me an electric toothbrush. She was right. Oral hygiene is important and I needed to tend to brushing my teeth twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say I wasn&#x27;t enthused. Early electric toothbrushes took up a lot of space on the counter and they were noisy as a beehive up against your head. Worse, my gums bled.  I&#x27;ve never been a morning person and using that toothbrush didn&#x27;t improve my mood any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I graciously thanked my aunt and I tossed the toothbrush and never wanted one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But time marches on and products do improve. This toothbrush is quiet, quick, and it doesn&#x27;t shred my gums. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the basin, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Kyle, December 2012</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for traveling. I don&#x27;t travel with my oral Bmelectric toothbrush since it&#x27;s too heavy. This works just fine for short travel time. It&#x27;s perfectly compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small so it would work well for traveling especially with the case, it&#x27;s lightweight, only requires one battery, is fairly quiet when running, has a gentle vibration, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s asking price and I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s better than a regular toothbrush. Nothing moves on it, it just vibrates, and you can get a toothbrush like that for about $12 in the store, and the head is REALLY small. Not necessarily a bad thing, I find it makes me slow down and brush more which I&#x27;m sure my dentist would approve of, and it helps me to reach my back teeth without gagging, but that small of head on a toothbrush isn&#x27;t going to be good for everyone and it takes a lot more time to get your teeth cleaned. Overall, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the asking price for what it is and remained unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Compact, handy, batteries last a long time, does a nice job, etc.  What&#x27;s not to like?  The only bad thing is that replacement brush heads are prohibitively expensive.  So, in effect, this portable toothbrush is a disposable item.  That&#x27;s OK, though.  If you don&#x27;t use this item twicw a day, every day, it will probably last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric toothbrush so I am not sure what to compare this to.  I do not feel as if there is anything magical about this toothbrush.  It seems like a regular toothbrush that vibrates.  Environmentally, it does not seem responsible to me as it has a plastic case and battery but I still have to do all the work that I would have to do with a normal toothbrush.  The bristles are nice and have lasted a long time considering I push hard when brushing my teeth.  The battery has lasted a long time and I am still on the first one.  While this product is good, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because I don&#x27;t think it does much more than an inexpensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that&#x27;s gentle and effective. Its very compact and solidly built. Battery lasts a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a replacement for a sonicare toothbrush, but if you&#x27;re used to getting that extra clean feeling, this works great in a travel bag.  It&#x27;s sleek, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and the lid keeps your toothbrush clean in a tight space because it won&#x27;t pop off like some of the travel tooth brush cases you get for regular tooth brushes.  Seems to work well, have had it for almost 4 months now and used it frequently for travel and camping, and have not had to replace the battery yet.  My only suggestion would be if they could taper the lid to fit on the other side of the toothbrush so you&#x27;d have a more full length handle and wouldn&#x27;t have to set down the cap separately, then this thing would be the perfect travel</li>
            <li> This my second one.  The first one unfortunately fell victim to a leaky battery.  The small size makes them a bit awkward for regular use at home but these toothbrushes are perfect for travel, as they are smaller than your typical non-electric toothbrush plus case.  Update: the second one now has a balky switch.  These are beautifully designed but alas not durable.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush when I got it a year ago.  Now that I&#x27;ve had 2 six-month checkups, I LOVE it.  The hygienist showed me on the computer how all my measurements for gum disease have improved by 1 point each time I have been in.  She said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing differently, but keep doing it!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not an absolutely faithful flosser, but do try for 4/7 times for week.  I kept getting warned about gum disease, but now I&#x27;m on the good list.</li>
            <li> Nice for kids, maybe, but the power is so weak that this is effectively a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This will make a great travel brush since it runs on batteries, making it easy to tote.  This is a basic electric toothbrush, no frills or fancy settings.  One tidbit of information.  If you want to order replacement brushes, order the standard size.  I mistakenly ordered the compact size and the brush is way too small to be useful.  This brush comes with the standard brush on it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this toothbrush, so I was very surprised that I liked it so much.  The case is small and sleek, and is easy to store in my handbag. Aside from the outer appeal of the toothbrush, using it was even better. I normally use a regular toothbrush or a spinbrush, and I&#x27;ve been happy with them until now.  My teeth feel much cleaner with the Panasonic brush.  Apparently my old brushes didn&#x27;t clean as well as I thought they did!  The brush is quiet and easy to use, and it feels comfortable in my mouth.  The results are so much better than I expected.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> For some reason, whenever we travel, the thing I&#x27;m most likely to forgot to pack is a toothbrush--not that it&#x27;s a tough thing to track down in other cities, but, for the convenience factor, it&#x27;s nice to have the Panasonic Adult Portable Compact Toothbrush sitting in my toiletries bag always ready for action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact size and weight (it runs on one AAA battery, which is said to provide up to 180 minutes of usage) makes it easy to bring along.  Although I&#x27;m used to something a little more on the aggressive side, like our everyday, rechargeable Oral-B spin brush, this vibrating brush still gives your teeth a nice, clean feeling while being gentle on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s very sleek-looking, too.  Most would expect the elegant tube to contain mascara rather than a toothbrush, and the entire unit is both waterproof and 100% washable.</li>
            <li> As a recent convert to the non-manual toothbrush world, I have to say this brush is so much easier to use.  The smaller head of the brush makes it more maneuverable to get to the molars and in the gumline for a very complete clean.  I am also very glad to have a cap to this brush -- if you keep this brush in your bathroom, it&#x27;s so much better than the brush head being exposed to the elements.  So that the wet brush head can dry, the cap does contain two slits at the top for air to circulate.  I appreciated having this cap especially when taking the toothbrush on vacation, making this brush so easy to pack and stay clean.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be due for a brush head change, but the suggestion from the product description states 2 months until replacement.</li>
