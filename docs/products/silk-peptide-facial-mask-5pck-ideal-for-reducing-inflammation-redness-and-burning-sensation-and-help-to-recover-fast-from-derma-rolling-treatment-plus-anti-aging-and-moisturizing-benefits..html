            <li>Arrived quickly and I use it after my derma roller.</li>
            <li>but I splashed cool water on my face and the mask and it came right off.</li>
            <li>The mask was easy to put on my skin and it stayed on until I was ready to take it off.  </li>
            <li>It is so nice and soft even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I love this peptide silk mask â€“ it helps my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>By using the mask right after the derma roller, I do not have that problem at all..  </li>
            <li>It helped me put sting out right away.</li>
            <li>I can tell you right now...</li>
            <li>Its really saturated and doesn&#x27;t fit my face exactly, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  </li>
            <li>there is no harsh odor and is easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>After the mask my skin gets so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using the facial silk mask.</li>
            <li>My face always feels really soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>My skin felt firm and bright.</li>
            <li>I got better result than I only use derma roller alone.</li>
            <li>I satisfied this facial mask.</li>
            <li>My face felt like it had a nice professional facial!</li>
            <li>After rolling when my face is hot, feels sunburned and is ready to absorb what every you put on it,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothes my skin and keeps it moist and super soft.</li>
            <li>Pure luxury...</li>
            <li>After the roller, the facial silk mask helps the redness and keeps your face calm and cool and then in the morning you really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>So I could tell huge different now.</li>
            <li>It comes in a package of 5 and the box is a lovely color of pink.</li>
            <li>I like felling that the serum is really absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely keep using these.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my wrinkes and blotchy skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother looking</li>
            <li>Its now apart of my nightly routine when im getting ready for bed.  </li>
            <li>It really did its job.</li>
            <li>it really does help the irritation after derma rolling treatment.</li>
            <li>My poor face would be red and irritated after using the derma roller and this is a wonderful addition to my treatments.</li>
            <li>Immediately after taking off the mask my skin was soft, it had a glow to it and it looked better than it has looked in a long time.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will do the full hour.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to scents, and the silk peptide masks haven&#x27;t bothered me.  </li>
            <li>these masks did more to heal my face in less than 24 hours than all the ointments and creams the doctor instructed me to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommed to people whom want to do derma rolling treatment on skin care.</li>
            <li>High recommended.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin was still a little red in areas but it was calm and many areas were just &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; now.</li>
            <li>Once all they yummy ingrediences are soaked into your skin, the continue with your normal routine.  </li>
            <li>It had dried for the most part</li>
            <li>Using this mask for 20 minutes afterward allows my skin to return to its normal tone immediately.</li>
            <li>They are my little miracle! :)</li>
            <li>it made my face feel alive again!</li>
            <li>I first cleanse with a Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, then I use my derma roller followed by the Copper Peptide Serum and then put this mask on my face for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I left mine on for the first time around 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and isn&#x27;t any trouble.</li>
            <li>My skin was so moist and soft after.</li>
            <li>The ingredients include natural silk, protein peptide, HA, BFGF, EGF, and chlorophyll.  </li>
            <li>I know the silk is natural for anti infection.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Dermaroller for about 2 months, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wrinkles or old acne scars .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels like the cool down you do after you work out but for your face.</li>
            <li>My face cool down and rash diminish.</li>
            <li>I used one after my 2nd derma roller use and my skin calmed down very quickly...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Silk Peptide Facial Mask for not only those who do derma rollers, but anyone that wants a luxurious skin treatment at their home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was less red and puffy and my skin felt silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks soft and supple now and I am no longer re-applying concealer to cover up the red areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin the next day was SOOO sensitive..</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount or gratuitous for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Right after derma roller treatment there always slight red bums, the mask help sooth the skin and reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>But if u live at a dry city like me in denver, do not stay this mask on ur face over 15 mins.</li>

            <li> I first cleanse with a Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, then I use my derma roller followed by the Copper Peptide Serum and then put this mask on my face for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I left mine on for the first time around 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and isn&#x27;t any trouble.</li>
            <li> My skin was so moist and soft after.</li>
            <li> The ingredients include natural silk, protein peptide, HA, BFGF, EGF, and chlorophyll.  </li>
            <li> I know the silk is natural for anti infection.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermaroller for about 2 months, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wrinkles or old acne scars .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels like the cool down you do after you work out but for your face.</li>
            <li> My face cool down and rash diminish.</li>
            <li> I used one after my 2nd derma roller use and my skin calmed down very quickly...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Silk Peptide Facial Mask for not only those who do derma rollers, but anyone that wants a luxurious skin treatment at their home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was less red and puffy and my skin felt silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks soft and supple now and I am no longer re-applying concealer to cover up the red areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin the next day was SOOO sensitive..</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount or gratuitous for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Right after derma roller treatment there always slight red bums, the mask help sooth the skin and reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> But if u live at a dry city like me in denver, do not stay this mask on ur face over 15 mins.</li>
            <li> 7 days in I was still dark red and so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I needed to cut open the mouth &amp; nose slot but certainly not a problem.  </li>
            <li> but I fell asleep and woke up a few hours later.</li>
            <li> My face was breaking out and my skin was extremely irritated.</li>
            <li> This is a thick mask that you can use with the derma roller, it helps massaging the skin and activate the circulation.&lt;br /&gt;Great for deep moisture</li>
            <li> It calms down the redness on my skin which is cause by using derma roller.</li>
            <li> , so I went half in between.  </li>
            <li> I can still feel the difference after a few days too ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I have used some masks before that didn&#x27;t tell you which side went down and it was like a guessing game.  </li>
            <li> but i think it is a little bit expensive.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!! I put it on for 45 mins while resting and even fell asleep. My skin was so moist and soft after. Very satisfied with this product. I even think i look younger. ðŸ˜€ got complements at work.</li>
            <li> You will have to get used to the feeling of something on your face lol. I have never tried a mask and tried it for the first time tonight and must say it is awesome. Looking forward to seeing a difference. Not sure if it is reusable but that would be the icing on the cake :D</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed post the derma roller. My poor face would be red and irritated after using the derma roller and this is a wonderful addition to my treatments. It soothes oh so well and makes my face silky. I definitely give 2 thumbs up for this one. Fantastic idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Using this mask made me feel like I was at the spa!  It had a nice cooling affect &amp; did wonders for my skin; it alleviated my redness and helped heal my skin while keeping hydrated. My skin looks soft and supple now and I am no longer re-applying concealer to cover up the red areas of my face.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so fine and smooth</li>
            <li> Love is mask. It pampers my skin after I use derma roller. It calms down the redness on my skin which is cause by using derma roller. After the mask my skin gets so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Derma Rolling Post Facial Silk Mask are great. Use this product to reduce redness, repair damaged and injured skin and helps with the delay of aging. The ingredients include natural silk, protein peptide, HA, BFGF, EGF, and chlorophyll.  It comes in a package of 5 and the box is a lovely color of pink. You only have to leave it on for 20 minutes and instructions are included on the box. Great product.</li>
            <li> This mask helped to soothe my skin after using the derma roller.  The mask was easy to put on my skin and it stayed on until I was ready to take it off.  Immediately after taking off the mask my skin was soft, it had a glow to it and it looked better than it has looked in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using the facial silk mask. They leave my face feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. They work very well at helping to reduce the redness and after effects of derma rolling and gave me a nice cooling feeling while I was using them. My face always feels really soft and smooth after use. As an added benefit the facial masks are individually wrapped so you don&#x27;t have to worry about unused ones drying out.</li>
            <li> This facial mask helps after using derma roller. My skin gets reddish, but now I feel more relieve after using the mask.</li>
            <li> This facial mask was exceptional! it made my face feel alive again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this mask after my second session using the derma roller and I LOVE IT.. I&#x27;ve been using ever since.  The mask is cooling and it speeds up the healing process after the use of your derma roller.  My skin the next day was SOOO sensitive.. I&#x27;d work out at the next day, and the sweat would make my skin sting because of the derma roller I used the night before.  By using the mask right after the derma roller, I do not have that problem at all..  The mask is a must for all derma roller users.  You don&#x27;t rinse it off after use.. Once all they yummy ingrediences are soaked into your skin, the continue with your normal routine.  A Vit. C Serum and your favorite moisterizer.  ENJOY</li>
            <li> Feels great after rolling.  Its really saturated and doesn&#x27;t fit my face exactly, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  After rolling when my face is hot, feels sunburned and is ready to absorb what every you put on it, I like felling that the serum is really absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed this Silk Facial Mask, the refreshing feeling on my skin. The great rejuvenating feeling and look. The baby like softness to the touch.  We have to keep it on for a full hour so you must make sure you have the available time to follow through completely.  Top quality home facial with the very best top quality ingredients.  I received this product at a discount or gratuitous for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic good!!! I&#x27;m from China and I&#x27;ve been using so many masks from worldwide, I have to say this one is good! But if u live at a dry city like me in denver, do not stay this mask on ur face over 15 mins.</li>
            <li> Pure luxury...This is the last step in my spa at home facial treatment. I first cleanse with a Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, then I use my derma roller followed by the Copper Peptide Serum and then put this mask on my face for about 20 minutes. It&#x27;s feels like the cool down you do after you work out but for your face. I do this treatment once a week. Peptides are really important for aging skin. It firms your skin, closes your pores and clears up your blemishes but most of all, it feels amazing. I was offered the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price to try and test as a consumer and provide my opinion. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I used this mask for derma rolling skin treatment. It helped me put sting out right away. My face cool down and rash diminish. My skin felt firm and bright. I could see the result instantly. I am very happy with the mask. I will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> It is not only for derma rolling treatment, but also for skin care regimen in regular basis. It is super good.</li>
            <li> This product did in fact reduce the irritation/burn from doing dermarolling. However, I think I prefer to feel the effects to know where my skin is at. But for those not wanting to feel any burn, slight as it is, then this product is good, it is soothing for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this peptide silk mask â€“ it helps my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It feels nice, my skin seems more hydrated, it reduces wrinkles, rashes and redness. Overall, it is a great product that really works for me and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> The mask just works great for me! it reduced the redness on my skin causing by the acne and the second morning when i woke up, my face looks brighter. I would recommend this mask for you.</li>
            <li> this goes great along side my derma roller and derma pen. it is very soothing and relaxing. there is no harsh odor and is easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> The product is as described. I love it. Highly recommed to people whom want to do derma rolling treatment on skin care.</li>
            <li> This is very wonderful product to use with derma rolling treatment. My skin looks bright and more firm. I know the silk is natural for anti infection. That&#x27;s why I choose this mask to prevent infection. I got better result than I only use derma roller alone. High recommended. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel amazing! It is so nice and soft even after the first use. I will absolutely keep using these.</li>
            <li> I got these after I got my derma roller and so far I am very happy with it....I used one after my 2nd derma roller use and my skin calmed down very quickly...also all the redness disappeared .</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my face feel so nice and soft after I use it!  They are individually wrapped so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out! Love the fact that they are also preservative free! I look forward to using them and will highly recommend them to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love the mask. It help my skin feel it&#x27;s moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love it. but i think it is a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this mask better than the cream,, after using my derma roller this mask is refreshing and works as described, 2 thumbs up!~</li>
            <li> I use this after I use my derma roller. It&#x27;s soothes my skin and keeps it moist and super soft. Really helps with my wrinkes and blotchy skin. I recommend this</li>
            <li> Works great with the 540 Titanium Derma Roller.  After the roller, the facial silk mask helps the redness and keeps your face calm and cool and then in the morning you really see the difference.  It&#x27;s like getting a facial.</li>
            <li> This is a great self at home facial. Easy to apply, and isn&#x27;t any trouble. When you get it off, it comes off nicely and leaves the face clean and hydrated. My face felt like it had a nice professional facial! Looked that way as well!</li>
            <li> OMG these SAVED my face! After a chemical peel I was soooo red. I had purchased these prior and forgot I had them. 7 days in I was still dark red and so sensitive. My face was breaking out and my skin was extremely irritated. I was using the ointments and the items recommended by dermatologist. They weren&#x27;t helping. I even got an aloe plant and blended it with cucumber and honey and reapplied that to my face. Although it felt good it still did not get rid of the beet red and irritation. I remembered these and put it on before bed. I meant to take it off in 30 min to an hour (directions say 30 min)... but I fell asleep and woke up a few hours later. It had dried for the most part but I splashed cool water on my face and the mask and it came right off. To my surprise I looked human again. My skin was still a little red in areas but it was calm and many areas were just &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; now. I used it again the next morning.. and again in the afternoon. I can tell you right now... these masks did more to heal my face in less than 24 hours than all the ointments and creams the doctor instructed me to use. I am so thankful... and have just placed another order. Whatever it is they put in here... it works. It&#x27;s easy to use... and it&#x27;s not messy. Love love love them!!!!! They are my little miracle! :)</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this stuff I use it every night after I get my bath I put it on. It makes me feel so much younger. My skin is so much smoother looking and it don&#x27;t have blemishes like I did have before. I am so satisfied with this that I will definitely be buying more when this is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It has my face feeling nice and soft and it provides a great moisturizer for my skin which I need because I have dry skin! I can still feel the difference after a few days too ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feel refreshed , feeling softer and smoother with each use.  Its now apart of my nightly routine when im getting ready for bed.  I have even recommend this to all my girl friends and we have even used these on our beauty nights when we all get together for facials and manicures. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use following derma roller treatments which make your skin appear reddened for quite a while. Using this mask for 20 minutes afterward allows my skin to return to its normal tone immediately. My skin feels nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I satisfied this facial mask. It really did its job. I didn&#x27;t use this mask before I used derma rolling treatment. So I could tell huge different now. My skin was more hydration. The redness diminish. My deep wrinkle looked reducing. I was so happy with this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermaroller for about 2 months, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wrinkles or old acne scars .  I was so hoping they would fade!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using a derma roller for about 3 months and I have been looking for a good treatment to apply afterwards and hadn&#x27;t found anything so far that I really liked.  I was given a chance to try the Silk Peptide Facial Mask and I really love it.  When you apply the mask to your face, it provides a cooling sensation and just helps to reduce the redness and pain from the derma roller.  I left mine on for the first time around 45 minutes.  The instructions state you can do 30 to 60 minutes, so I went half in between.  I think next time I will do the full hour.  I like that they give you instructions on how to un-peel the mask and which side goes on your face.  I have used some masks before that didn&#x27;t tell you which side went down and it was like a guessing game.  I am pretty sensitive to scents, and the silk peptide masks haven&#x27;t bothered me.  I love how my face felt after I took the mask off.  I was less red and puffy and my skin felt silky smooth.  I would highly recommend the Silk Peptide Facial Mask for not only those who do derma rollers, but anyone that wants a luxurious skin treatment at their home.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review. All opinions are my very own.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smoothing. I needed to cut open the mouth &amp; nose slot but certainly not a problem.  I&#x27;ve given a couple to friends and they they loved them as well. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Wonderful after derma rolling. Sooths and cools.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply face mask. I didnt this without a mirror and removed just as easily.  Skin felt cooler and more hydrated afterwards. Skin just felt happy and alive.  No greasy residue was left on my face when I was done. Just a feeling of smooth skin. HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I use it after my derma roller. It makes my skin brighter and completion better</li>
            <li> I really love these mask. They are so saturated with serum. I put them in the fridge before using it. I always keep all my eye masks and sheet face mask in fridge. It leaves your skin hydrated and moisturized. It has good amount of serum on it so after I take it off my face, I rub it on my hands and arms. Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> it really does help the irritation after derma rolling treatment. Right after derma roller treatment there always slight red bums, the mask help sooth the skin and reduce irritation. if you have derma roller I recommend to purchase this product as well to increase result from your derma roller treatment.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived quickly and keeps my face moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> The perfect follow up to a derma rolling session.  My face has never felt so great!! Soothing and refreshing.  The directions are so easy to follow and I love that the results of my derma roller show up even faster when used in conjunction with this mask.</li>
            <li> This is a thick mask that you can use with the derma roller, it helps massaging the skin and activate the circulation.&lt;br /&gt;Great for deep moisture and it is very good for a spa relaxing day.</li>
