            <li>The polisher is also a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Box was beat up and some kind of unidentified stain on the inside of the box.</li>
            <li>My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quick and I couldnt be happier because I was so eagar to use it immediately!</li>

            <li>This brush worked okay.</li>
            <li>I love it, my skin looks and feels better than before, it made my skin cleaner and shinny.</li>
            <li>What I saved on this model, I was able to splurge on my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I am most pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I was very happy to get this facial brush as a promotional item</li>
            <li>I am 48 and love the way my skin feels and looks.....</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheap, it worked for like a month.</li>
            <li>This Facial Cleanser brush is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is an okay brush.</li>
            <li>The facial brush is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>This item came quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use (good thing as it came without instructions) and effective, so it seems like a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>My product was delivery fast and good quality</li>
            <li>For the price, its not bad!</li>
            <li>I admit they look kinda cheap</li>
            <li>Both are raving at how smooth their face is after each use.</li>
            <li>this one is super light weight and flimsy.</li>
            <li>and you feel the clean when you are done.</li>
            <li>It works very well, your skin will feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>others have noticed and are good enough to tell me they notice.</li>
            <li>I found this and loved that it came with all of the brush head attachments that I would want and couldn&#x27;t believe how much extra makeup came off of my face after using this.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li>I am happy it has a speed setting because the highest speed is a little too rough on my skin but the lowest one works great.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin from the very first time I tried the the skin care system.</li>
            <li>Very good product, a little smaller than I expected but its perfect.</li>
            <li>The large body brush has been great on my dry legs.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times but love the way it feels on my face!</li>
            <li>Was great at first until it stop working abruptly.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing at getting the flaking washed off and keeps it from coming back as often.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price and the benefits to me.</li>
            <li>Although I use this product rarely, my wife uses it and found to be useful.</li>
            <li>Only used the brush so far and seems to work great.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to be of the sturdiest construction, so longevity may become and issue, but so far I would have to say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it, as it wasn&#x27;t even worth my time and effort.</li>
            <li>After wetting your face and applying the cleanser, the two speed motor gently spins the brush leaving your face feeling clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Not very effective for getting a good clean face.</li>
            <li>I tried the spinning brush on my face, i&#x27;m better off using a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li>I feel like only after a couple of days my face looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you pull your hair back all the way.</li>
            <li>This item was purchased for my wife and she really loves it!</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>As for the other attachments: I have no idea what the sponges are for; the massager is a hard plastic with knobs and really doesn&#x27;t feel good; and the callus remover isn&#x27;t powerful enough to do any good.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rotation is gentle, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply made cheap.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter weight than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have very flaky skin around my nose and on forehead.</li>
            <li>The instructions were clearly translated from Chinese (box says made in China)  as the typos and word choices are hilarious and would never be used for a five star product.</li>
            <li>A natural anti-aging product that is affordable, I felt the difference after my first time using it</li>
            <li>This cleans pores and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin extra soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>This happened not once, but three times; all with new batteries!  </li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of brushes with a lot of high prices.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend...</li>
            <li>Before I was only using makeup remover wipes and thought that was getting my face clean enough, but wow, what a difference after washing your face with this brush.</li>
            <li>I could have gone with the more powerful and expensive one but</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft on this one, and I can get my face cleaner by using a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Worth It especially for your teen boys who are playing sports.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the RC facial brush and Body Cleansing Skin care and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries.</li>
            <li>Not much power and doesn&#x27;t really scrub well.</li>
            <li>Brush barely spins.</li>
            <li>I had heard about the benefits of using a facial cleaning brush but did not want to pay the outrageous prices for the more popular name brand ones.</li>
            <li>I know that is not very long and who knows how it will hold up over time.</li>
            <li>Not sure it is as powerful as the more expensive, but your face definitely feels smoother after one use.</li>

            <li> My only issue is the batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease.</li>
            <li> And after of my time of using it, I noticed a marked decline in black heads and pimples.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The skin care system is a professional cleaning system has rotating head provide a micro massage of the skin that removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> They sell other styles and I am ordering another from the same place.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first as I had used a more expensive facial cleaning device several years ago.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t one fleck of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I Just wet my face and then put a little water on the brush so my face wash would be damp enough to use.  </li>
            <li> They sweat get dirty enjoy there</li>
            <li> Definitely could notice a difference in the smoothness of my face after I exfoliated all of the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> definetly not worth the $14.99 that i paid.</li>
            <li> This RC 2 Variable speeds unit is less than half the price, requires 2 batteries</li>
            <li> The brush will do for a few weeks probably, but the other attachments are gimmicky and poorly made especially the pumice.  </li>
            <li> My assumption is that it&#x27;s really not water proof, only somewhat, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I got two (one for each bathroom) for less money!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to get too dramatic and say that my skin is GLOWING, but I have definitely noticed a &amp;#34;&amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;&amp;#34; look since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>

            <li> Not sure I got what everyone else wrote about...</li>
            <li> And the pink aplicator tging scratches you face up so bad.</li>
            <li> one attachment is broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy...</li>
            <li> This expensive device took 4 batteries and, while in the shower, all the batteries fell out of it&#x27;s chamber.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted a power face cleaning brush to replace my manual one. I saw a lot of brushes with a lot of high prices. So based on the ratings AND the price, I bought two of the RC 2 kits. I admit they look kinda cheap but who cares - THEY WORK! I don&#x27;t need randy, just a face scrubber that does what it&#x27;s supposed too ad this one does. I could have gone with the more powerful and expensive one but why? I got two (one for each bathroom) for less money!</li>
            <li> Stoppee working after three uses, even with swapping out the batteries.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after one use.. And the pink aplicator tging scratches you face up so bad. Feels like tiny prices of glass are being scrapped across your skin...</li>
            <li> This brush worked okay. I would have preferred if it rotated a bit faster but all in all it did the job until today 4/27/15 when it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this. I went to the bathroom and tried all the tools that came with it and I am very impressed. I went back on to see if I could order replacement tools, but they do&#x27;t do that. It is well worth the price and the benefits to me. They sell other styles and I am ordering another from the same place. This item came quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin looks and feels better than before, it made my skin cleaner and shinny.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter are extremely happy with this product. They have only used it for three days. I know that is not very long and who knows how it will hold up over time. Both are raving at how smooth their face is after each use. This seller is A+. Highly Recommend...</li>
            <li> Not much power and doesn&#x27;t really scrub well.</li>
            <li> Although I use this product rarely, my wife uses it and found to be useful. Although the price is bit higher, we are happy with the item.</li>
            <li> My facial pores are noticably cleaner. You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the attachments are a bonus. The rotation is gentle, and yet it still gets the job done. The large body brush has been great on my dry legs. What I saved on this model, I was able to splurge on my cleanser and moisturizer.I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, healthy glow and feels great!!!</li>
            <li> Brush barely spins. Not very effective for getting a good clean face. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Worth It especially for your teen boys who are playing sports.  They sweat get dirty enjoy there youth but you want them to take care of their faces as well.</li>
            <li> Only used the brush so far and seems to work great.  My only issue is the batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I was very happy to get this facial brush as a promotional item and I&#x27;m happy to report my findings.&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels nice and relaxing on my face and I do feel that it&#x27;s making a difference in the overall appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to get too dramatic and say that my skin is GLOWING, but I have definitely noticed a &amp;#34;&amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;&amp;#34; look since I&#x27;ve been using it. I am happy!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great product for exfoliating and cleansing. The pumice wheel can be used for feet and elbows. The polisher is also a nice addition. I am most pleased with this product. Shipping was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Very good product, a little smaller than I expected but its perfect.</li>
            <li> Got it today. Box was beat up and some kind of unidentified stain on the inside of the box. one attachment is broken. very cheaply made. definetly not worth the $14.99 that i paid. I tried the spinning brush on my face, i&#x27;m better off using a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not sure I got what everyone else wrote about...this one is super light weight and flimsy. The brush will do for a few weeks probably, but the other attachments are gimmicky and poorly made especially the pumice.  The instructions were clearly translated from Chinese (box says made in China)  as the typos and word choices are hilarious and would never be used for a five star product. Disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and daughters to use, but I&#x27;ve actually got some use out of it as well. It&#x27;s simple to use (good thing as it came without instructions) and effective, so it seems like a pretty good value. The unit comes with a removable and washable brush unit and a sample of cleanser. After wetting your face and applying the cleanser, the two speed motor gently spins the brush leaving your face feeling clean and relaxed. It does not seem to be of the sturdiest construction, so longevity may become and issue, but so far I would have to say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

            <li> After debating for 2 weeks which product to go with I chose the Brite leaf. I picked it for the reviews and for all it came with. I have only used it a couple of times but love the way it feels on my face! I feel like only after a couple of days my face looks so much better. I can&#x27;t wait to see the progress after using it longer. The package arrived very quick and I couldnt be happier because I was so eagar to use it immediately!</li>
            <li> I had never owned a scrubber....but I have a great one now!!! what a delight ......I am 48 and love the way my skin feels and looks.....others have noticed and are good enough to tell me they notice.</li>
            <li> This face scrubber feels like QUALITY. It works very well, your skin will feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 8/5/15 and got it within 3 days, so great job there.  However, by 8/15, (used 7 times) the batteries were corroded. I didn&#x27;t use in the shower and didn&#x27;t imerse in water either. I Just wet my face and then put a little water on the brush so my face wash would be damp enough to use.  The brush is too soft on this one, and I can get my face cleaner by using a wash cloth. As for the other attachments: I have no idea what the sponges are for; the massager is a hard plastic with knobs and really doesn&#x27;t feel good; and the callus remover isn&#x27;t powerful enough to do any good.  I didn&#x27;t return it, as it wasn&#x27;t even worth my time and effort. It&#x27;s simply made cheap.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> My product was delivery fast and good quality</li>
            <li> I had heard about the benefits of using a facial cleaning brush but did not want to pay the outrageous prices for the more popular name brand ones. I found this and loved that it came with all of the brush head attachments that I would want and couldn&#x27;t believe how much extra makeup came off of my face after using this. Before I was only using makeup remover wipes and thought that was getting my face clean enough, but wow, what a difference after washing your face with this brush. I am happy it has a speed setting because the highest speed is a little too rough on my skin but the lowest one works great. Definitely could notice a difference in the smoothness of my face after I exfoliated all of the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> No issues. For the price, its not bad! Just make sure you pull your hair back all the way. Mine got caught accidentally and ouch!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first as I had used a more expensive facial cleaning device several years ago.  This expensive device took 4 batteries and, while in the shower, all the batteries fell out of it&#x27;s chamber.  This happened not once, but three times; all with new batteries!  I finally threw it away.  This RC 2 Variable speeds unit is less than half the price, requires 2 batteries and it&#x27;s chamber is located on the side so when it&#x27;s  in use, your hands keep the batteries chamber shut.  This works as well as the more expensive ones; it does the job and I&#x27;m happy to own 2.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A natural anti-aging product that is affordable, I felt the difference after my first time using it,it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my wife and she really loves it!</li>
            <li> It is much lighter weight than anticipated. I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> It works great. Not sure it is as powerful as the more expensive, but your face definitely feels smoother after one use.</li>
            <li> The facial brush is my favorite!!! Lathers soap well and you feel the clean when you are done. The foot abrasive brush also works creat. I don&#x27;t wash without it. Take it into shower or over sink!</li>
            <li> I have very flaky skin around my nose and on forehead. This product is amazing at getting the flaking washed off and keeps it from coming back as often. I love using it. It is very simple to attach the brushes, sponges as well.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The skin care system is a professional cleaning system has rotating head provide a micro massage of the skin that removes dead skin cells. This cleans pores and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin extra soft and radiant. I noticed a difference in my skin from the very first time I tried the the skin care system. It left my face feeling soft and smooth. There wasn&#x27;t one fleck of dry skin. I recently purchased the RC facial brush and Body Cleansing Skin care and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries. I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face. My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference. Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa. Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease. This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.And after of my time of using it, I noticed a marked decline in black heads and pimples.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap, it worked for like a month. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> This Facial Cleanser brush is wonderful. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Was great at first until it stop working abruptly. My assumption is that it&#x27;s really not water proof, only somewhat, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Yes i give it 5 stars because it deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is all what you need when it comes to facial and body polishing or cleaning,from your head to your toe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It stopped working after I used it once! Not happy... Otherwise it worked good</li>
            <li> This is an okay brush.</li>
